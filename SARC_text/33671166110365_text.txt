By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Callie Kirkpatrick 
Elementary has a long history of high parent and community involvement. Our 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement was written and aligned with the District LCAP goals: 1. Callie Kirkpatrick Elementary School will recruit, hire 
and retain highly qualified sta
ff, and provide ongoing professional development in order to support optimum learning 
opportunities for student success. 2. Callie Kirkpatrick will effectively maximize learning for all students, staff, and pare
nts 
in order to prepare students for college 
and career in the 21st century. 3. Callie Kirkpatrick will engage and involve parents 
and community in the educational process of our students and by doing so, will increase the level of trust within the 
community. Parent involvement is a strength at Calli
e Kirkpatrick. Parents and community members volunteer regularly 
in classrooms, the library, and the front office. Our school webpage, notices home, email, the Parent/Student Handbook 
and communication apps are used to share our work and resources with par
ents and the community. We encourage 
involvement through Parent Teacher Association and advisory committees at the site and District level. Committees on 
site will include but are not limited to the School Site Council, English Language Advisory Committee,
 
and our PTA. Parents

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Each Menifee Union School site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP), including a disaster preparedness 
plan annually. A copy of the CKE Comprehensive School Safety Plan is 
available for review at the school office. The plan 
includes emergency procedures for natural disasters and campus intruders. Students, teachers, and staff are trained to 
prepare for a wide range of emergencies, and frequent drills help to refine emergency
 
skills, policies, and procedures at 
all school sites. Also, following each drill,  specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to improve 
emergency procedures continually, and therefore enhance campus safety.
 
 
CKE staff exercises str
ict adherence to the district adopted safety/site security protocols, which include a leveled/colored 

-
in using our Raptor 
system. CKE Comprehensive Safety P
lan is reviewed annually; the entire staff participates in monthly emergency drills and 
provides feedback.
 
 
Finally, school and district administrators immediately investigate threats of harm. Teachers and administrators seek to 
foster lines of open commun
ication, so students and parents feel comfortable reporting inappropriate activity, including 
bullying, harassment, or threats. All CKE staff take a strong stand against threatening behavior or bullying and investigate 
complaint matters thoroughly.
 
 
Our Po
sitive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) system teaches and reinforces appropriate student behaviors. 
We foster social
-
emotional learning (SEL) skills development in the form of weekly lessons delivered school
-
wide to all 
students, supported by 
curriculum from SecondStep.org. The curriculum establishes high expectations for achievement 
by all students in every subject area, and students are supported by counseling services that include crisis counseling, peer
 
counseling, and intervention programs
.

As a school district, we are focused on increasing academic 
achievement in English Language Arts and Mathematics along 
with increasing school attendance.   To this end, our professional development strategy is geared to increase student 
engagement through the implementation of our district
-
adopted curriculum and th
e type of interventions we have in 
place.  Site and district leadership teams review achievement data on state and local assessments to make determinations 
on staff development and training, to be aligned with yearly goals and projected activities.
 
 
MUSD p
rovides two full days of professional development along with additional days as needed per site and data.  
Additionally, the major areas of focus have been on the adopted curriculum and intervention. State and local achievement 
data are used to make determ
inations. This district provides two full days of professional development along with 
additional days as needed per site and data. Additional days are provided before, during, and after school by either 
directors, coordinators, or intervention specialists.
 
Additionally, conferences, workshops, Grade Level PLC, and staff 
meetings are some ways of providing on
-
going professional growth. Many teachers and administrators continue to take 
college
-
level courses to enhance their teaching or administrative skills.
