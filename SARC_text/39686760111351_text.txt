Lopez 
Elementary School a high performing school that is challenging, fun, and stimulating for our 
students. Because we are a Turnaround Arts Program school, every student re
ceives 45 minutes 
per week of visual and performing arts instruction. Our teachers are also training in VTS and are 
trained in integrating the arts in all facets of instruction.
 
 
Teachers are receiving Professional Learning Community training by Solution T
ree and are being 
provided Common Core Training by the school district  in ELA  AND MATH. As the district has 
implemented BenchMark Advance and Ready Math, in addition to My Perspectives for the ELA and 
Math programs they are also benefiting by attending p
rofessional development. The PD is designed 
so that teachers can collaborate, calibrate and share best practices in the classroom. We also have 
two instructional coaches who work with teachers to plan and improve classroom instruction by 
modeling and exami
ning student data. Teachers continue to provide instruction using effective 
research  based instructional program that uses Direct interactive  Instruction. We have 
implemented a shared leadership this year at Fremont involving our teacher leaders in each 
of our 
initiatives.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instruct

The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes fo
r all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the Califo
rnia content standards calls for. This information is far more meaningful when along with 

mes of the textbooks used 
in our core cla
sses and their dates of publication.

eted on site 
to update and restructure classrooms and restrooms bringing the building up
 
to code. The site has approximately 70 classrooms, and administration 
offices that are used on a daily basis. Two gyms, a cafeteria/multipurpose room, a library, and a computer lab are in existen
ce and are updated and 
maintained regularly to meet State re
gulations. There are several bathrooms located in many areas of the campus and are used for students and staff. 
Three playground areas have been established to accommodate primary and intermediate children during the lunch and recess tim
es. Stockton 
Interm

separate and operates 
on its own.
 
 
Through a Healthy Start Grant a Fremont Parent Center was established to accommodate families an
d students with health care services. This center 
was created over a decade ago and is self
-
sustaining. The center is used to house our School Nurse, School Psychologist, Speech Therapist and other 
outside community partners who provide special services fo
r our families.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that em
ergency repairs are given the highest priority. Deep cleaning is planned throughout the 
year. Break time is used to provide the necessary deep cleaning that can only occur when students and teachers are absent fro
m the site.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that all classrooms, restrooms, and facilities are 
well
-
maintained and in good 
repair. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a cl
ean and safe school. As we continue to have budget 
cuts from the State, the principal and assistant principal are always looking for more effective and efficient ways to ensure
 
that the quality of cleaning is 
a priority for our site.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., Calif
ornia Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California Stat
e University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the

School Safety 
Plan
 

ures the school facilities 
are in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. Each year a deep cleani
ng process occurs during a close of school, either during 
the summer or other extended breaks. In the event of a facility plant emergency, the principal notifies appropriate site and 
district personnel to resolve 
the emergency and safely secure or evacuate
 
the students, based upon the site and district emergency preparedness plans. We complete a site review 
with the district Safety Inspection Checklist which occurs quarterly.
 
 
A comprehensive School Safety Plan, which was recently reviewed by the School Sit
e Council, helps to provide a secure, peaceful and clean environment 

during emergencies 
and natural disasters. Emergency drills are
 
conducted on a regular basis.
 
We have communications in place for families when a crisis occurs on site as well as district protocol.
 
Students have access to trauma counselors as well if/when a crisis occurs.
 
 
A safety team has been formed and meets three
 
times a year. During the meetings the team analyzes safety data, plans table top discussions, discuss 
safety issues, address concerns and creates policies and procedures to provide a safer environment for our students and staff
.
 
 
Every effort is made to e
nsure students are monitored while on campus throughout the school day. Our Campus Security Assistant, yard supervisors, 
teachers, site administrators and school staff provide supervision for students before and during school. The custodian inspe
cts the gr
ounds before the 
students come on campus. The playground is safe for all students. All visitors must sign in at the office and receive proper 
authorization to be on campus, 
and must display their passes at all times.
