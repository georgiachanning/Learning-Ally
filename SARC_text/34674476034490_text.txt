By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Mission Statement: Valuing a culturally and academically diverse community, Del Paso Manor Elementary School's mission 
is to educate and inspire each student to develop a strong academic foundation that supports life
-
long 
learning and 
responsible citizenship by providing intellectually challenging instruction while promoting integrity and critical thinking.
 
 
School Profile:
 
Del Paso Manor K
-
6 Elementary School (DPM) is nestled in the well
-
established Del Paso Manor 
community in Sacramento. 
What was once a neighborhood school is now one of the most dynamic schools in the district. Students who have been 
identified as Gifted and Talented (GATE) attend the on
-
site Rapid Learner (RL) program. The RL program is comprised 
of 
students throughout the district (approximately 20% of our school population), and serves grades 2
-
5. DPM has a growing 
number of students identified as English language learners (ELL) (approximately 37% of our school population). 70% of 
our students re
ceive free or reduced price meals.
 
 
While every student comes to DPM with different needs, we believe each student deserves the same high
-
quality 
education. Our school faculty, students and site Behavior Intervention Team (BIT) are actively working to incr
ease the 
positive behaviors at our school site. We strive to provide a physically and emotionally safe school environment. We are 
focused particularly on defining, teaching, and reinforcing the behaviors that support success practices. Each week, there 
is 
a "Bucket Filler" drawing recognizing students efforts towards positive behaviors. Students also assist with projects in 
support of our site's strategic plan. DPM students have the opportunity to participate in a variety of after
-
school programs 
such as be
ginning and advanced choir and band, dance, KidzArt, Early Engineers, Mad Science, Running for Rhett, Chess, 
Young Rembrandts and other supervised weekly activities.
 
 
Principal's Message:
 

 
 



 
Always feel that you count. Always feel that you have worth, and always feel that your life has ultimate

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September, 2018
 
 
San Juan Unified held a public 
hearing on September 25, 2018 and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students,

-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle 
developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection co
mmittee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the quality, currency, and availabili
ty of 
the standards

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent 
Year)
 
 
Del Paso Manor was modernized during the 1995 school year. The scope included: roof replacement, interior and exterior 
painting.  Window systems were repaired, new doors with handicapped accessible hardware, restroom restoration.  
Electrical infrastructure upgrade to provide for Internet, cable telephone, was completed throughout the school.  
Currently, there is sufficient space to house the student population.  There is a site custodial staff that cleans the buildi
ng, 
along with di
strict support for major/minor repairs.  The district provides gardening and landscape services on a regular 
schedule.  Regular fire/emergency drills are held and badges are required for all visitors and personnel.  In 2005, under 
Measure J the site receiv
ed an upgrade to the HVAC system; from window units to roof mounted packaged HVAC systems.  
The school also received site wide roof replacement.  The new HVAC project also upgraded the gas and electrical service.  
The Air Quality Management District paid t
o furnish and install a new asphalt driveway. Through the Deferred 
Maintenance program, the entire interior was painted in 2008.
 
 
The Board of Education and the Superintendent's policy is to ensure that all students are provided with a safe and well
-
mainta
ined learning environment. The board approved resolutions in 1998 and 2002 to adequately fund maintenance 
activities and preserve the repairs and improvements funded by two facility bond measures. The school buildings, 
classrooms and grounds are safe, clea
n and functional. An inspection of the facility was conducted in October 2019 and 
determined that there were no unsafe conditions that required emergency repairs. District maintenance staff ensures 
that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repa
ir and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
computer automated work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs and health and 
safety repairs are given the highest priority. The Board of Education has adopted c
leaning standards and custodial staffing 
requirements for all schools in the district. This school meets the Board's standards for custodial staffing and cleanliness.
 
The school's custodians are trained in the proper use of cleaning chemicals and Integrate
d Pest Management techniques. 
They are managed day to day by the Principal with assistance from the district's maintenance department. The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, with funding allocated for major repair or re
placement 
of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. Annually the district budgets $2 million dollars for deferred 
mai
ntenance activities.
 
 
Del Paso Manor is one of 3 schools in the district that recently was approved to modernize and add new construction.  
Over the next 2 years, the school will be replaced with a new school on a different part of the school 
campus.  October 
2nd, 2018 was the day of the groundbreaking ceremony and the job is expected to be complete in May of 2020.  The new 
school will be larger for our growing population.
 
 
Del Paso Manor was last inspected by the School Insurance Authority (SI
A) November 6, 2014.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

a law enforcement dispatcher or via a direct report from a school staff member, school visitor or other person. This school 
has a school safety team which reviews safety matters 
that may affect the campus. Our school safety team meets regularly 
to discuss safety issues, update our site emergency plan, and to take steps to be proactive in preventing various types of 
school
-
related safety issues. Community Safety Specialists and law
 
enforcement provides speakers to address students, 
staff and community groups on matters of school safety. Our safety team receives training, when requested, from Safe 
Schools or law enforcement. This school is responsible for updating our Comprehensive S
chool Safety Plan (CSSP) by March 
1st of every year per the Education Code. As part of the update, this school meets at least once per year with a law 
enforcement officer to review the CSSP, has the local fire department review the CSSP and we hold a commu
nity meeting 
to review the CSSP. The CSSP must be approved by the School Site Council before being submitted to the district safe 

site sp
ecific crisis response procedures and a district standardized emergency flip chart. This school conducts and keeps a 
record of all fire drills, lockdown drills, shelter in place drills and/or earthquake drills up to or in excess of what is re
quired 
by the 
Education Code.

Professional development is a key part of the continuous improvement process for educators. The goal of our quality 
professional development is to support the learning of teachers and paraprofessionals to positively impact student 
achievement.  Annually, t
eachers and site administrators participate in professional development in a variety of 
opportunities.  Seventy
-
five minutes per week are dedicated to staff collaboration and training planned by site leadership 
teams. The District also provides a cycle of 
continuous professional development for Administrators through Principal 
Networks as well as Leadership Academies.
 
 
The District provides professional development opportunities for teachers and administrators that support the 
implementation of Common Core 
State Standards in English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and the 
ELA/ELD Framework.  Specific professional development initiatives include: Culturally Responsive Practices, Critical 
Literacy, TK
-
2 Reading, Supporting Independence and
 
Engagement through Reading and Writing, Math to the Core, 
Expository Reading and Writing Course, and ELD Foundations.  District departments, Center for Teacher Support, grant
-

ing opportunities.  Professional 
development opportunities are voluntary for teachers and are provided throughout the year in a variety of formats: during 
the school day, after school, on Saturdays, and during summer and vacation breaks. Many teachers and 
administrators 
also take advantage of opportunities with Sacramento County Office of Education, California Department of Education, 
the college/university programs, state/national education organizations, and private educational institutes.
 
 
What grounds t
he professional development in the district is the District Strategic Plan and the Local Control 
Accountability Plan. Professional Development is further determined using one or more of the following: (a) student 
achievement data, (b) staff survey data, an
d (c) district
-
identified goals.  Professional development addresses the Common 
Core State Standards, teaching strategies, curriculum, assessment, technology, classroom management, safety, and 
leadership. Administrator training accompanies professional dev
elopment in district focus areas, providing 
implementation support for teachers on site.  Content
-
area coaches are available at some schools.  Additional classroom 
support is provided to new and struggling teachers by consulting teachers from the Center fo
r Teacher Support.
 
 
Paraprofessionals are encouraged to participate in professional development at the district and site level.  Specifically 
designed training is also offered to non
-
instructional support staff such as clerical and custodial staff that inc
ludes both 
operational and instructional topics.
