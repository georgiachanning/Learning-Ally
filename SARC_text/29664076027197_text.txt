By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Union Hill Elementary School District was established in 1868, with only a few students in a one
-
room schoolhouse.
 
 
Since that time the district enrollment grew to over 800 students and now consists of a traditional K
-
8 program at Union 

preschool and infant through eighth grade childcare program. The District continues to expand and modernize its fa
cilities, 
with the recent playground upgrades, roofs, and HVAC units. Even with the modernization projects the district continues 
to provide a school environment that symbolizes its rich history and tradition.
 
 
Union Hill School District has a rich history
 
beginning as a one room school in 1868, and growing into the trademark for 
excellence in education that it is today. Our district features an outstanding preschool through eighth grade articulated 
and enriched academic program taught by staff who are devo
ted to the academic and personal well being of every 
student; and an acclaimed before and after school extended child care program. Our integrated technology and art 
programs, band, choir, after school sports program, and the most supportive and productive
 
Parent Teacher Club in the 
county enhance the high quality student learning in Union Hill School District!
 
 
Every child deserves the best education our schools can provide. We have high standards and expectations for academic 
achievement and student citiz
enship. We are an embodiment of the things we believe in. We are dedicated to doing all 

We are committed to the total development of ou
r students into productive citizens and life
-
long learners. We are the 
Union Hill School District.
 
 
Our Core Values:
 
We focus on our students. Every conference, meeting, exchange, problem/solution is characterized by the quality of 
genuine caring 
about what is best for our students. Our success is measured by the success of our students.
 
 

more than one side. We handle 
controversy, deliberations, teaching, problem solving and future thinking with real care 
for the students and each other. We recognize and celebrate the talents and contributions of our staff. We observe and 
appreciate the hard work of our teachers, suppor
t staff, custodians, office personnel, and administrators
 
 
We are a welcoming, friendly, and open community. We take pride in our entire learning environment from classrooms 
and student safety to buildings and grounds. We value our parents and community as
 
essential partners in the learning 
processes necessary for student success.
 
 
We are proud of our ability to offer individualized attention and continuity of program to our students in a Pre
-
school to 
Eighth Grade setting. We function as an effective schoo
l system, a model for what the best in public education can be.

School 
Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Union Hill Elementary School takes effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effor
t, 
the school uses a Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) as a survey i
nstrument developed by the State of California OPSC. The results 
of this survey are avilable at the school district office.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
The maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency and safety
-
related repairs 
are given the highest
 
priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The Supervisor of Maintenance, Operations and Transportation works with the custodial staff to develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance
 
Union Hill School District has a de
ferred maintenance plan to assist in budgeting for expenditures associated with major 
repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air 
conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exter
ior painting, and floor systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade elev
en. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabil
ities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
