By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Calif
ornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternat
e achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for e
ntrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The IDEA Academy 
@Cottonwood has many opportunities for parents to become a more integral part of their children's 
education.  Monthly Coffee & Conversation with the Principal meetings and other Parent workshops are scheduled 
throughout the year to empower parents in suppo
rting their children's academic achievement.  An annual Back to School 
night in August and Community Open House in the spring are hosted to provide parents with opportunities to learn more 
about their children's classroom expectations and school work.   Pa
rents can be classroom volunteers and assist in the 
classroom on a voluntary scheduled basis, or they can assist as a room parent, helping for special events or occasions.  
Parents are encouraged to participate on the School Site Council, Safety and Englis
h Learners Advisory Committee. 
Throughout the year, parents also have opportunities to participate in a Cultural Literacy Program and AVID College and 
Career Days. The PTA also provides extracurricular opportunities for the students and any parent is welco
me to participate.
 
 
At the district levels, parents can serve as volunteers and participants in many capacities including the DELAC Committee, 
WAVE Foundation, focus groups and the Superintendent's Advisory Council.  These committees/groups meet regularly 
to 
focus on issues of interest to parents at the district level.

The California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1, 2018, regarding how to calculate 
school
-

pupil expenditures that will be 
reported on 2018
-
19 report cards.
 
 
Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
A range of academic and social emotional supports exist for Westside students, many of which are unique to 
individual 
school sites, tailored to meet the needs of the members of each school community.  Many of these supports are provided 
by counselors (district and/or community
-
based), school psychologists, school nurses, specialists in 
Speech/Language/Hearing, 
adaptive physical education teachers, or behavior specialists.
 
 
Student Study and Child Study Teams assist students experiencing academic and/or social emotional challenges, those 
with special needs, and with assessing eligibility for placement in special 
classes and/or recommending specialized services 
as needed. Special services and classes are offered for students with learning disabilities as well as other students with 
exceptional needs.
 
 
Twelve counselors provide a range of support services for Westsi
de students.  Programs and services are developed and 
provided based on student data (such as referrals for threatening or self
-
harm behaviors and academic intervention 
letters) and the needs of the school site.  Often these programs build upon the skills 
and habits of mind that are nurtured 
and developed in Leadership Development through Physical Education (LDTPE), AVID, and Boys Town.  Examples of 
counseling programs include specific groups for strong
-
willed students, grief groups, groups for students who
 
are 
exhibiting signs and behaviors due to trauma, academic organization groups (addressing academic organization of 
assignments, goals, and expectations), and community outreach and service clubs such as Student Ambassadors or 
Kindness Club. School counse
lors are assisted by a cadre of Campus Climate Assistants, highly trained paraprofessionals 
who provide social emotional support and structure for students during more unstructured parts of the school day like 
recess and lunch. Counselors and Educational S
ervice staff members collaborate regularly with community agencies to 
facilitate alignment and coordination of resources and supports for students and their families.
 
 
The district continues to collaborate with the Department of Mental Health to coordinate
 
with local mental health 
agencies to provide School Based Mental Health services at all school sites for eligible students.
 
 
Behavior specialists provide student and staff support for students needing intensive behavior support and/or 
intervention.
 
 
Bilin
gual paraprofessional support staff provide assistance in the classroom for English Learners. Bilingual assistants 
receive ongoing professional development in the areas of strategies to support students learning English within the 
classroom; review of dist
rict wide academic programs supporting English Learners; specialized language practice used for 
translation during parent/teacher conferences; protocols for English Learner identification; and criteria for student 
reclassification.
 
 
Several programs, desig
ned to build students' emotional intelligence and capacity and to promote positive and proactive 
social decision making, reduce bullying, and build an inclusive culture continue to be implemented districtwide. Two of 
these are BoysTown (implemented in grad
es Kindergarten through 8) and Leadership Development through Physical 
Education for students in grades 4, 5, and 6.
 
 
A variety of online mathematics (i.e. Big Brains and ALEKS) and reading intervention (i.e. FastForWord) programs are 
accessible for studen
ts.  In addition to being used during the school day, students can also access these programs from 
home.  These online interventions are site
-
specific.

A variety of extended learning opportunities like before/after school tutoring and/or lunchtime Learnin
g Lab support were 
offered at all sites.  Learning Labs provide support with homework and opportunities for collaborative learning sessions.  
Tutoring may provide review of foundational skills, frontloading of key skills and concepts, and/or homework assis
tance.  
Five days of intersession support is provided for middle school students during each spring and summer intersession.  An 
Extended School Year program is available during the first part of summer intersession for those students with disabilities 
who
 
qualify.  A traditional district wide summer school program was on hold for the summer of 2018 due to significant 
maintenance and repairs at school sites. In lieu of the summer school program for elementary students, optional 
interactive Summer Learning K
its were purchased for parents and caregivers to use with their students over the summer 
intersession. The Kits contained games, tools, and materials to sharpen and support reading, writing, and math skills.  
Additionally, the district offered its third su
mmer KinderCamp during the summer.  The three
-
day experience was designed 
to provide an opportunity for incoming Kindergarteners and their parents to learn about Kindergarten expectations in a 
day camp
-
type environment.

going 
professional learning and training opportunities for teachers, 
administrators, and para

educators.
 
 
The goal of professional learning is to provide staff members the support that they need to meet the diverse educational 
needs of Westside students. The key
 
area of focus for professional development and support for the 2018
-
2019 school 
year was the use of assessment data, particularly common formative assessment data, to guide and inform instruction.
 
 
Teachers, classified instructional classroom support staf
f, and site administrators are provided four days of professional 
development each year. These days are calendared work days.  For all groups, two of the days are dedicated to issues and 
needs related specifically to our English Learners, foster youth, or 
other at
-
risk students.  For teachers and site 
administrators, two of the four days are devoted to building their capacity to use data, particularly formative assessment 
data, to inform instruction.  For classified instructional staff, two days were devote
d a to a variety of topics including 
trauma
-
informed support for at
-
risk youth; BoysTown; Leadership Development through Physical Education; and meeting 
the academic needs of students with exceptional needs.

Curriculum Resource Teachers, under the direction of the Director of Curriculum 
and Instruction, provide much of the individual and small group coaching support.  This is especially true in the area of 
integration of classroom technology tools to support
 
teaching and learning.  During the 2018

district has developed a robust system for new teacher 
support including 1:1 support, Professional Learning Communities 
(PLCs), and direct classroom support. New teachers are assigned a mentor/coach dependent upon their credential status. 
Support providers, mentors, and coaches in the program are veteran teach
ers who have been released full
-
time from their 
classroom responsibilities.  Every new teacher is supported weekly at their site by their mentor/coach with the focus of 
support being aligned to their goal and individual support plan.  Full time administrat
ors/coaches also support the pre
-
interns and interns based upon the requirements of their university's memorandum of understanding and the 
requirements of the CTC.  The pre
-
intern and intern teachers participate in biweekly professional development based 
u
pon the district initiatives as well as their unique developmental needs.  Teachers holding a Preliminary credential are 
supported by teachers on special assignment who serve as full time Support Providers.  Those holding a Preliminary 
credential attend a 
series of six professional development opportunities specially designed and aligned with the California 
Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTPs). For veteran teachers needing additional support, the Peer Assistance and 
Review (PAR) program is designed
 
to improve the education of students by providing opportunities for additional training 
for all teachers.
