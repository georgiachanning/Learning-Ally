By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

In 2011, the Governor and State Legislatur
e extended the suspension of State Board of Education (SBE) adoptions of 
instructional materials until the 2015

16 school year (Education Code Section 60200.7).  At this time the State has adopted 
frameworks for English Language Arts/ English Language Deve
lopment, and math which will assist in our implementation 
of  California's Common Core State Standards. We are currently piloting  State Board of Education adopted (January, 2014) 
instructional materials for math to reflect the rigor of the California's Co
mmon Core State Standards, teachers are 
developing curricula units, and various resources are provided as additional instructional materials. The State Board of 
Education adopted ELA/ ELD instructional materials in November 2015  which directed our pilot a

instructional materials.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The 
SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative As
sessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate
 
in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who
 
have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Centralia School 
District welcomes and values parental involvement in District and school programs.     During the 
2018
-
2019 school year, CESD continued its fifth year using the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) process.   This new 
funding process requires school di
stricts to engage parents, teachers, employee groups, and the wider community to be 
a part of the development of the LCAP.   Informational meetings were held with various stakeholders including Board 
members, parents, PTAs, and advisory groups (DELAC, GATE
, PTA).   An LCAP committee was formed that included 
representatives from each stakeholder group. The culmination of the LCAP committee was the adoption of the 2015
-
16 
LCAP on June 24, 2014 by the Board of Trustees.  The LCAP represents an opportunity to f
urther strengthen the 
commitments between our District and our community on behalf all of students.
 
 
DHH Literacy Workshops, along with Sign Language classes for parents and community members, are offered throughout 
the year for parents of our deaf student
s so they can learn to help their students with literacy at home, as well as Deaf 
Students Speak Out Awards Program and DHH Family Movie Night.  The Transitional Kindergarten program and 
Kindergarten programs hold a Kindergarten Welcome before school start
s so they can meet their teachers and learn about 
the program, and also have a Holiday and end of the year performances.  The school's annual Holiday program was offered 
to parents in December, and the Annual Talent Show was once again a success!  In addit
ion, all students and parents are 
involved in Red Ribbon Week, Walk to School Day, Deaf Awareness Week, Cyber Safety, and Teacher Appreciation Week.
 
 
 
This year, Raymond Temple has developed an innovation configuration matrix to help us develop and expand 
our "future 
focus pedagogy" this map known as the ICM matrix provides the vision and language to help teachers at Raymond Temple 
implement the many district initiatives including Project Based Learning, STEAM education, and technology just to name 
a few 21
st century practices. This continuum is a road map that outlines all the ways you can see, hear, and experience 
Future Focus pedagogy at RT. We recently received 15 IPADs that we plan on using to introduce Code, robotics, and 
Icreate.
 
 
Raymond Temple's Sch
ool Site Council is an advisory group of parents and staff that meets regularly to receive 
information, discuss school programs and provide input toward school
-
based decision making. Raymond Temple School 
parents and staff also participate on District plan
ning committees.  The ELAC committee is comprised of parents of English 
Learners. They discuss issues related to the English Learner program and opportunities for parents to learn English as well 
as how to help their children in school. Two parents attend 
the District DELAC meetings and report back to our ELAC.
 
 
The PTA at Raymond Temple is extremely active and benefits the school and students by encouraging and organizing 
parent involvement, promoting student achievement and self
-
esteem, and enriching the 
educational program by 
providing special programs, activities, services, materials, and equipment. Parent involvement opportunities include:

The plan provides students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environmen
t. Each school includes 
the following requirements of SB 187 within their safe school plans: current status of school crime; child abuse reporting 
procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsion; notific
ation to 
teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and 
school employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.  Annually, the school evaluates 
and 
updates the plan. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Plan, are reviewed with school and District 
staff in the fall, at the start of each school year.
 
 
Raymond Temple School believes that to ensure a positive learning experience requir
es a safe and orderly environment.  
Staff received training on a School
-
wide Positive Behavior program that was first fully implemented during the 2013/14 
school year and continues today.    Teachers teach, monitor, enforce, and exhibit these attributes th
roughout the year.  
The school follows all District Board Policies, including those of Safety, Suspension, Expulsion, Mandatory Expulsion, and 
Sexual Harassment.
 
 
The Centralia School District Board of Trustees reviews the Safe School Plans annually by Mar
