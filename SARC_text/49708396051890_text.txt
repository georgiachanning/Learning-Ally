Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law 
to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to 
prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be con
sistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and comm
unity members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/
dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials 
(School Year 2019
-

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
March 2016
 
 
As the standards for California have changed from the California state standards to the Common Core standards in ELA 
and Mathematics and the science standards have moved to the
 
Next Generation Science Standards, textbooks and 
instructional materials have been purchased that align with the new set of grade level expectations. In some curricular 
areas, the District has moved cautiously before formally adopting textbooks as publish
ers continue to revise their 
materials to better align them with the Common Core. At Oak Grove, new mathematics textbooks were adopted in 
preparation for the 2016
-
17 school year. Materials for English Language Arts are in process of review and piloting for
 
2019
-
20. At Willowside, TCI Social Studies textbooks were formally adopted in 2016.  Willowside is in process of reviewing 
materials for English Language Arts and will be piloting materials during the 2017
-
18 and 2018
-
19 school years.  During 
the 2019
-
202
0 school year both schools are piloting new NGSS aligned materials.
 
 
The Oak Grove Union School District has an established curriculum committee to review the process by which materials 
are introduced, piloted and then taken to the Board for adoption.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.

In addition, there are opportunities for parents to become involved through School Site Council, the English Language 
Advisory Committee, the G
ifted and Talented Education (GATE) Parent Advisory Committee, the Oak
 
Grove Education Partners (OGEP) and other support organizations.
 
 
Parents receive regular communication from the school and the district through the use of emails, automated phone calls
 
and notices home. In addition, the parent community is informed of school and district activities
 
through the use of district managed social media accounts and school and district websites.
 
 
The mission of the District's parent organization, OGEP, is to p
rovide financial support for educational activities for the 
students of the Oak Grove Union School District in the areas of academic excellence, engagement with the arts, 
development of life skills, celebration of diversity, and stewardship of the environm
ent, and to contribute to the efforts 
which help strengthen the sense of community at both the school and the district levels.
 
 
Parents are also involved with overseeing the schools programs through involvement in their site councils. School site 
councils 
seek to gain parent involvement in order to help determine student needs, gather input and shape programs. Site 
Councils are responsible for allocating site funds in support of student needs through reviewing teacher requests aligned 
to their educational g
oals.
 
 
Parents of English Language learners at both sites are involved in their English Language Learner committees and the 
District English Language Learner committee in order to support and engage in programs that lead to their students 
understanding of 
the English Language and engagement in school while preparing them for their future.
 
 
Parents are involved in the Gifted and Talented Program that seek to challenge and engage students on a daily basis and 
through extended learning opportunities.
 
 
Informal
ly parents engage in the Oak Grove School District though helping in fundraisers, class event days, chaperoning 
field trips, helping in the classroom and more.
 
 
The Oak Grove Union School District welcomes parent involvement and appreciates the support of 
all of our community.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Professional development and instructional growth are highly valued in the Oak Grove Union School District.  As part of 
the negotiated calendar, teachers participate in two professional development non
-
instructional days annually.
 
 
In the 2016
-
2017 school year teachers participated in a full day training related to effective classroom management 
strategies and procedures.  
In addition, teachers had the opportunity to select from a variety of professional growth 
opportunities in October.  Included in those options were training on effective differentiation strategies including higher 
level questioning, English Language Develo
pment strategies, technology integration, and report card training.  In the 2017
-
2018 and 2018
-
2019 school years professional development opportunities included collaboration around curriculum 
mapping, positive climate and culture, student intervention and
 
assistance, restorative practices, technology integration, 
and attendance at content area conferences.  In the 2019
-
2020 school year professional development opportunities 
included project based learning, adaptive software for mathematics and reading, sch
ool safety, English learner and special 
education support.
 
 
Every week the Oak Grove Union School District holds shortened Thursdays meetings in support of teacher development 
and student achievement.  Teachers meet in Professional Learning Communities and
 
as a whole staff to review student 
achievement data, ranging from formative to summative, including dashboard data, to determine areas of additional focus 
and support.  Staff also meet throughout the year to review academic achievement data through the us
e of collaborative 
time, release time, and extended time.
 
 
Moreover, the superintendent and site principals support staff with release time as needed to work on development of 
programs and funding to attend local professional development opportunities.
