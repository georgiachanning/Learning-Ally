School Description
 

with their intellectual, emotional, physical, and social well
-

engaging students with high academic rigor with 
an emphasis on STEAM. STEAM integrates the study of 
Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics.  Our students are thinking like engineers, 
mathematicians, artists, innovators, and technologists. They are involved in creating new materials or r
e
-
purposing current materials in the Makerspace Lab. They are learning about coding, programming, and 
videography in our Computer Lab.
 
 
Schoolwide, we model and encourage excellent behavior utilizing Positive Behavior Interventions and 
Supports (PBIS) for 

cultivated with students and parents and will ensure that we work with our families and stakeholders to create 
a powerful STEAM community.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
Federa
l Title I funds pay for release time for teachers on special projects, professional development and for 
additional technology and programs in the classroom. These expenditures are approved through the SSC and 

School Plan
 
for Studen
t Achievement. Title I funds also contribute to the running of 
our afterschool program where students work on improving skills. Our PTA raises funds for field trips, library 
books, and special assemblies through our annual fundraisers.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district
 
and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Intern
et access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use 
restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a 
workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a 
workstation, and the ability to print documents.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
T
he SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
We strive to keep all students and staff safe at Walnut STEAM Academy.  School staff members monitor the 
grounds for 30 minutes before school as well as at recess and lunchtime. Staff and the principal regularly 
review the rules for safe, responsible behav
ior in school, on the playground, and on the way to and from 
school. In addition, our district recently installed gates around the school as an added safety protocol to keep 
our students more safe.
 
 
Visitors must enter the school through the office where t
hey are assigned a visitor badge to wear throughout 
their stay. We revise our School Safety Plan annually; it was last revised in August, 2019. The plan includes 
procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and inventories of emergency supplies. A copy of this
 
plan is available 
in the office. We share the plan with all staff during our first schoolwide staff meeting and review it regularly 
all year long. We practice earthquake and intruder drills twice yearly and hold fire drills regularly.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, ev
ery school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all 
local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. A
dditionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
htt
ps://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
On October 10, 2019, the La Habra City School District's Go
verning Board held a public hearing to certify the extent to which textbooks and instructional 
materials have been provided to students. The Governing Board approved Resolution #15
-
2019 which certifies as required by Education Code ยง60119 
(1) that textbook
s and instructional materials were provided to all students in the district, including English learners, to the extent that e
ach pupil has a 
textbook or instructional materials or both to use in class and to take home; and (2) that sufficient textbooks and
 
instructional materials were provided 
to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with the cycle
s and content of the 
curriculum frameworks in English/language arts, math, science, and hist
ory
-
social science.
 
 
All textbook and support materials are selected from the state's list of approved materials and adopted by the State Board of
 
Education. Materials 
approved for use are reviewed and a recommendation is made to the Governing Board by a s
election committee composed of teachers, administrators, 
and parents. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. The inf
ormation that follows shows 
the currency and availability of the textbooks
 
and other instructional materials used at the school as of August, 2019.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are

Each year the Dstrict
 
looks at student achievement data along with teacher 
requests for specific trainings to determine the plan for the four 
Districtwide professional development days.  In 2017
-
2018, training 
focused on new English Language Arts adoptions, Wonders and Amplify
.  
In 2018
-
2019 training focused on new Mathematics adoptions, Bridges and 
Math Links.  In 2019
-
2020, training focused on developing Multi
-
Tiered 
System of Supports (MTSS).
 
 
In addition to the Districtwide trainings, each site works with a consultant 
from 
InnovateEd to develop Cycles of Inquiry around their strategic focus.  
Teacher leaders attend seven days of training to analyze student data, 
develop a strategic focus for the year, implement evidence based lessons, 
and analyze student work.  Teachers on S
pecial Assignment (TOSAs) 
assigned to each site work with all teachers throughout the year during the 
school day and during PLC time to support implementation of the strategic 
focus.
 
 
C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides th
e following information relevant to the State 
priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making 
decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (Sc
hool Year 2019
-
20)
 
We have many ways for parents to participate in the life of our school, and 
we depend on parents to keep our programs running smoothly. We offer 
five Coffee with the Principal meetings a year. During the meetings, we 
discuss subjects 
such as anti
-
bullying education, math, reading, writing, 
and/or state test information. Parents can also join our School Site Council 
(SSC) or the Advisory and Information (A&I) committee, which works with 
administration to help make financial decisions an
d disseminate 
information regarding Walnut School. Parents of English learners are vital 
to our ELAC and to our outreach efforts on behalf of the success of our ELL 
students.
 
 
The PTA is another parent group who meets frequently and would 
welcome your invo
lvement. Walnut PTA buys new books for the library 
and helps pay for field trips through PTA fundraisers. Parent volunteers are 
always welcome to help with special projects in the classroom and to 
chaperone on field trips. We always need new volunteers! To
 
volunteer, 
contact the front office and fill out a volunteer form. We ask all parents to 
attend Back
-
to
-
School Night in the fall, Open House in the spring, 
Makerspace showcases throughout the year, and parent
-
teacher 
conferences in October and January.
