ESSAGE
Berylwood Elementary School is a learning community composed of students, staff, and parents 
working in partnership toward the social and academic growth of all students. We deliver an 
academically challenging program with the support necessary for all students to achieve at high 
levels. Berylwood is a diverse community with  Title I, English Language Development (ELD), and 
Special Education students who complement our population of general education students. 
This diverse community interacts socially and academically in a safe, caring environment.
All children are not alike. Our staff works in an extremely dedicated manner to meet the differing 
needs, while at the same time maintaining high expectations for academic excellence. YMCA 
and Boys and Girls Club work with us in providing an after-school care program, which was 
recognized as the best in Ventura County. Our parents at Berylwood are thoroughly integrated 
within our school community. They provide meaningful activities and programs for students and 
parents. In cohesion with teachers, they improve the richness of the education that Berylwood 
students receive. Our curriculum is organized around the California State Content Standards. All 
instructional materials are adopted by the Simi Valley Unified School District in 
congruence with those standards. Student progress is assessed on a very regular 
basis, allowing us to tailor the instructional program to better assist the student 
in achieving those standards, as well as reporting that progress to parents. We 
welcome all to the Berylwood family.

The California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) System includes 
the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments (SBAC) for students in the general education 
population, and the California Alternate Assessments (CAAs) for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities.  Only eligible students may participate in the administration 
of the CAAs.  CAAs items are aligned with alternative achievement standards, which are linked 
with the Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  CAASPP results are a measure of how well 
students are mastering California™s standards in English language arts/literacy (ELA) and 
mathematics, and are given to grades three through eight and grade eleven. SBAC tests assess 
student performance in ELA/Literacy and mathematics utilizing computer-adaptive tests and 
performance tasks, and CAAs test items are aligned with alternative achievement standards 
which are linked with the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). 
The CAASPP results shown in this report include overall results comparing the school, district 
and state scores as well as the school™s overall score in each applicable subgroup. Results are 
shown only for subgroups with ten students or more taking the exam. For those categories 
that are blank in the tables, no students met subgroup criteria. More information on CAASPP 
can be found on the California Department of Education™s website www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/ca/.

PHYSICAL
 FITNESS
In the spring of each year, Berylwood 
Elementary is required by the state to 
administer a physical fitness test to 
all students in grade five. The physical 
fitness test measures each student™s 
ability to complete fitness tasks in six 
major areas. Students who either meet 
or exceed the standards in all six fitness 
areas are considered to be in the ﬁhealthy 
fitness zone.ﬂ The chart disclosed in this 
document reports only the percentage in 
each category, not a cumulative total of 
the results for categories 4 of 6 and 5 of 6.

ROFILE
The district takes great efforts to ensure that 
all schools are clean, safe, and functional 
through proper facilities maintenance and 
campus supervision. Berylwood Elementary™s 
original facilities were built in 1965; ongoing 
maintenance and campus improvements 
ensure facilities remain up to date and 
provide adequate space for students and 
staff. District maintenance and site custodial 
staff ensure that the repairs necessary to keep 
the school in good condition are completed 
in a timely manner. The District Governing 
Board has adopted cleaning standards for all 
schools in the District.  A summary of these 
standards is available at the school office, at 
the District Office, or on the Internet at www.
simivalleyusd.org.
A work order process is used by school and 
district staff to communicate non-routine 
maintenance requests. Emergency repairs 
are given the highest priority. 
2018-19 Campus Improvements:
Ł Conversion of a computer lab to a 
  Makerspace area
2019-20 Campus Improvements Planned:
Ł Installation of perimeter fencing for student 
  safety
Every morning before school begins, the 
custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards 
or other conditions that need attention 
prior to students and staff entering school 
grounds. One day custodian and two evening 
custodians are assigned to Berylwood 
Elementary. The day custodian is responsible 
for:
Ł Classroom cleaning

VISION
 & 
SAFETY
School administration and teaching staff 
place a high priority on providing adequate 
adult supervision on campus before, during, 
and after school. As students arrive on 
campus each morning, campus supervisors 
are strategically assigned to designated 
entrance areas and the playground.  During 
recess and lunch, campus supervisors 
monitor playground activity.  At the end of 
the day when students are dismissed, campus 
supervisors monitor student behavior to 
ensure a safe and orderly departure. 
Berylwood Elementary is a closed campus. 
During school hours, all visitors must sign in 
at the school™s office and wear identification 
badges while on school grounds.

The Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan 
was developed for Berylwood Elementary 
in collaboration with local agencies and 
the district office to fulfill Senate Bill 187 
requirements. Components of this plan 
include child abuse reporting procedures, 
teacher notification of dangerous pupil 
procedures, disaster response procedures, 
procedures for safe arrival and departure 
from school, sexual harassment policy, and 
dress code policy. The school™s most recent 
school safety plan was reviewed, updated, 
and discussed with school staff in September 
2019.SCHOOL
 INSPECTIONS
On an annual basis, schools are required 
by the state to perform a comprehensive 
inspection and report those findings to 
the school community. The most recent 
inspection for Berylwood Elementary 
School took place on July 22, 2019. The 
School Facility Good Repair Status table 
illustrated in this report identifies the state-
required inspection areas and discloses the 
operational status in each of those areas.

a standard measurement used to identify an employee™s regular work load on a weekly basis. 
For example, an FTE of 1.0 designates a full-time position and the employee is on campus 
and available all day every day of the week; an FTE of 0.5 indicates that the staff member is 
available and on campus a portion (50%) of the week.
