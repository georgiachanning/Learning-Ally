School Description
 
Bubbling Wells Elementary School is one of sixteen elementary schools in the Palm Springs Unified 
School District. Opened in the fall of 1992, Bubbling Wells serves approximately 750 students in 
grades Transitional Kindergarten through grade five. Located 
just south of the city limits of Desert 
Hot Springs, school attendance boundaries include the county areas of Desert Hot Springs east of 
Palm Drive, west of Mt. View and south of Camino Campanero. Each year our school evaluates the 
effectiveness of our Sch
ool Plan for Student Achievement after state and district scores are 
available. Our School Site Council (SSC), English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)  and other 
leadership groups have the opportunity to review all student achievement data. Our School Pl
an 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) is monitored throughout the year. Revisions to our SPSA, and 
subsequent School Board approval, will occur if there are substantial budget and/or material 
changes during the school year. The School Plan for Student Achievem
ent is updated annually by 
the Bubbling Wells School Site Council.
 
 
The school staff reviewed current state and district policy on curriculum/instruction and student 
behavior. A determination was made that indicates the student discipline and behavior poli
cy is 
appropriate and effective.
 
 
The Bubbling Wells Vision and Mission statement is:
 

support and increase early literacy, mathematical conceptual knowledge, and a de
sire to continue 
learning with the help of technology, our teachers, school staff, families, and community.  We share

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to p
ublish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prep
are a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consist
ent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information
 
about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Bubbling Wells was constructed in 1992 at a cost of six
-
and
-
one
-
half million dollars. The school is located on a beautiful terraced site with three 
playgrounds providing a wide variety of playground eq
uipment and play opportunities. The original facility consisted of nineteen self
-
contained 
classrooms, five smaller rooms for small group instruction, a support staff, an administration building, a library, and a mul
ti
-
purpose room. During the 
summers of 1
993 and 1994, nine additional classrooms were added to the school to provide for the rapidly growing student population. An a
dditional 
six classrooms were added for the school year 2001
-
2002 to keep pace with the continuing growth. Six more classes were ad
ded for the 2007
-
2008 school 
year to accommodate the continued growth at the school. During the 2009
-
2010 school year, Bubbling Wells experienced a reduction in student 
enrollment and staffing due to the opening of Cabot Yerxa Elementary School. Eight clas
ses were eliminated during the 2009
-
2010 and 2010
-
2011 school 
years, relieving the overpopulated school. All buildings are connected to a security system that has kept vandalism and theft
 
to a minimum. The school 
has one part

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All Bubbling Wells parents are invited to participate in a wide variety of school activities. Parents serve as valuable volun
teers, important committee 
members and public supporters of t
he school and our programs. We have an active Parent Teacher Association that all parents are encouraged to attend. 
Parent science nights are held each year. The Bubbling Wells Parent Engagement Policy is distributed to all parents at the be
ginning of each
 
school year. 
A Bubbling Wells Compact has been developed and approved by staff and parents for use. 
 
 
At Bubbling Wells, we provide accessibility and opportunities for parents with limited English proficiency, parents with disa
bilities, and parents of 
mig
ratory students to participate in our school as well as the development of our parent engagement policy. The policy is provid
ed in both English and 
Spanish.
 
 
Examples of activities and actions supporting parent involvement:
 
 
* We have an active PTA who enc
ourages all parents to join them in planning school wide events and activities that enhance the learning experience for 
all students. 
 
 
* We have a room dedicated to parent support with computers/internet access and online line programs available for learn
ing English.
 

 
Student Success Team meetings with parents, students, grade level teams, administration and resource professionals are held a
t the teacher 
and/or parent request to review academic and behavioral deficits that are effecting academics. The goal 
of these meetings are to develop 
strategies to promote grade level mastery.
 

 
Home visits provided by school and district community outreach workers to work with parents on attendance issues that include
 
scheduling, 
health
-
related issues, and other specific 
causes for poor attendance. The community liaison also strives to connect parents with local 
community organizations that offer support for families in a variety of areas and circumstances.
 

 
The school nurse assists parents with identifying and accessing co
mmunity resources for specific needs.
 

 
Parent input at School Site Council meetings on instructional programs and strategies in order to develop the School School P
lan of 
Achievement. The School Site Council reviews draft of plan, makes recommendations or a
mendments and approves the final plan.

Each year we have designed professional learning based on student achievement data, research of best practices and discussion
s with teachers and 
principals. The specific approaches vary by content area. For ELA, in 2017
-
18, the focus was on aligning instru
ction to Smarter Balanced Assessments, 
depth of knowledge, and deeper understanding of the Reading Targets in Claim 1. In 2018
-
19 the focus was on the gradual release model, and 2019
-
20 
was an extension of the previous two years, as well as an addition of 
training around Claim 2 (Writing). The professional development in these areas was 
provided by the Schoolhouse Project. In 2018
-
19 the teachers began working with High Impact Math consultants. This professional development centers 

 
conceptual understanding. The training will take place over the course of three years.  During Year 1 (2018
-
19) the focus was 
on developing strategies to support number sense by implementing mental math routines and highlight the landscape of learning
 
in 
mathematics. During 
Year 2 (2019
-
20) the focus is on strengthening mental math routines, identifying the math goal of a lesson, and planning for and implement
ing a three
-
part lesson (Launch, Explore, Summarize). This professional development also supports 
teachers with the implementation of the district
-
adopted math 
program (Bridges in Mathematics and Number Corner).  Teachers have also participated in two days of Kagan Cooperative Learnin
g strategies over the 
past two years.
