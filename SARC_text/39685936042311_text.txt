By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The District takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the Dis
trict 
uses the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction.
 
The results of this survey are available at the District Office. Below is more specific information on the condition of the 
school and the efforts made to ensure that students are provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.

purpose room complex. The 
beautiful original brick building is currently home to Head Start preschool and also used for storage. Some original 
classro
oms built in 1952 (now being utilized for preschool and office space) and nine permanent classrooms built in 1956 
were modernized in 1989. A library and six classrooms were built in 1971 and modernized in 2005. An eight classroom 
wing was built in 1975. Po
rtable classrooms were added in 1985, 1997, 1998, 2001, and 2003.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep schools in good working order are completed in a timely 
manner. A work order process is used to ensu
re efficient service and emergency repairs are given the highest priority.

schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Program
 
The District allocates funding for deferred maintenance. The Deferred Maintenance 
Program includes funding for 
replacement of existing school building components so that the educational process may safely continue. Typically, this 
includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, wall systems, floor systems, etc

ster 
plan. As part of that activity there are projects planned at the campus which will be completed through the use of local 
funds. State funding will also be sought for those projects which may be eligible for modernization. The modernization of 
French C
amp is scheduled to begin in the spring of 2020. This project will construct a new classroom with learning 
commons, demolish classroom wing B and construct a new parking lot on an adjacent parcel.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Pa
rental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The success of a school is strongly influenced by the support of parents and the school community. Two part
-
time parent 
liaisons have been hired to help coordinate parent volunteers and plan events, workshops, and
 
other parent involvement 
activities. Parents regularly volunteer and work under the direction of our parent liaisons to complete tasks requested by 
teachers and other staff members. The Parent Brigade works from their own parent room, where they may bring
 
their 
children, use computers, and have easy access to resources they need. Parents are also actively involved in the School Site 
Council, ELAC, school
-
wide planning, parent conferences, bilingual parent support groups, and various parent committees 
for f
undraisers and field trips.
 
 
French Camp School publishes a trimester
-
long calendar that is distributed to students. The NTI messaging system and the 
French Camp website are used to keep parents informed of events happening at school. Manteca Unified striv
es to 
coordinate and communicate with the community including police, fire and other governmental agencies, news media, 
medical agencies and other community organizations. A few examples of such coordination and communication with 
community agencies includ
e programs such as fire prevention, water safety, parks and recreation activities, and the 
community gymnasium. Call our school at (209) 938

-
20)
 
 
All school sites in the Manteca Unified School District annually update the Disaster Plan and School Safety Plan. The plan 
was revised by Safe Schools Consultants and Site Administration according to the required adoption process with 
appropriate School Si
te Council public hearings and School Safety Planning Committee input. Teachers and staff annually 
receive training on disaster procedures. Teachers and staff received ongoing training throughout the 2019
-

year in order to meet the appropriate g
uidelines established by the state. The safety plans are confirmed and approved 
by March 1, 2020.
 
 
Manteca Unified School District continues to make strides in the improvement of the educational climate and reduced 


students and the security of campuses are high priorities in MUSD. School personnel and students participate in monthly 
disaster preparedness drills including specific proced
ures for fire, earthquake, flood, civil disturbance, and hazardous 
chemical situations. The school sites also focus on establishing goals that are needed.
 
 
The District has established procedures for submitting complaints against personnel and programs.  A
n information 

Also, 
a nondiscrimination/harassment report form is used to help staff in reporting and tracking data.
 
 
Our 

addition, authorized prevention activities include conflict resolution strategies, before and after school programs, and 
district
-
wide efforts
 
to prevent illegal gang activities with Drug Free and Tobacco Free School Zones clearly established 
and posted. Our District seeks grants and utilizes the Health Services Department to meet the health and counseling needs 
of students.
