By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
As the principal of Noble, my goal is to make sure that each child is sa
fe, given every opportunity to learn to his/her fullest 
potential, and enjoys coming to school each day. Our Noble School mission states that it is important for us all to work 
together to ensure our students become responsible, academic, independent, succ
essful, and empowered individuals. 
Therefore everyone must join together in an effort to teach our children. The parents, staff, and community must unite 
and do their part to ensure that each child receives an excellent education and a wonderful school exp
erience.
 
 
Noble is a K
-
5 Elementary campus that follows the Common Core State Standards for California.  We adhere to all district 
trainings, process, and procedures.
 
 
Noble houses the district office then holds a random lottery to fill the kinder class fo
r the upcoming school year.  This 
group of 24 students become the incoming Kinder PPP class.  This group of students move through the grade levels through 
3rd grade together.  Parents are encouraged to volunteer their resources to the classroom to make the
 
program effective.  
The curriculum, teachers, trainings, and assessments are consistent with the district and their grade levels.
 
 
Berryessa Union School District and Noble Elementary work to provide all students the skills to become lifelong learners 
an
d successful 21st century global citizens.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General: The district places a strong emphasis on ensuring that all schools are safe, clean, environmentally friendly, 
mechanically functional and inviting for students, staff members, and the community. To assist in this effort, the district 
utilizes Faci
lity Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC and local operations department developed 
inspection survey methods to keep facilities in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. The 
district regularly inspe
cts and reviews the condition of the school facilities and surrounding grounds. The district places 
the highest priority on those safeguards that impact the fire, life and safety protection of the students, staff, and school 
buildings. Below is more specif
ic information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students 
are provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School Buildings: Noble was opened in 1963. This school has 25 regular 
classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library, 
and an administration building. In addition to the main building, there are five portable classrooms that serve as 
classrooms for music, Science, after school community programs, and a daycare center.
 
 
Maintenanc
e and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order system process is used to ensure efficient service and 
highest priority is given 

in good working order. This site also had interior and exterior lighting upgrades completed through Prop. 39 initiatives in 
identified areas throughout the camp
us.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule: The district has developed cleaning standards and schedules for all schools in the district. 
A summary of these standards and schedules is available at the school or the Maintenance & Operations office. The 
principal, wi
th the guidance of the maintenance supervisor works daily with the custodial team to ensure that the cleaning 
standards are met, and that classrooms, restrooms, and campus grounds are kept clean, safe, and well
-
maintained.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019

Parents at Noble School choose to 
serve on the School Site Council, which approves the annually revised school plan and 
budget developed for instructional support to both English Language Learners (ELLs) and students identified as at
-
risk 
academically. In addition, parents serve on the Eng
lish Learners Advisory Committee to ensure that teachers and state 
resources help meet the academic and linguistic needs of all English Language Learners. Parents and teachers also serve 
on the PTA which raises funds to support physical education, art, ass
emblies, science, and technology programs. Annually, 
the PTA allocates funds for school
-
wide assemblies, class field trips, and materials to enhance each teacher's instruction. 
Noble School encourages parent and community volunteers to provide small group 
instructional support in classrooms 
when requested by teachers. Parents also contact community organizations and businesses to add opportunities for 
support of student learning with specialty programs, such as Project Cornerstone that provides a volunteer 
to read a book 
selection and complete an art project with the students. Employees from Starbucks and Junior Achievement also provide 
instruction annually in financial literacy and the role of the community in career development. Our parents partner with 
ou
r PTA to support a school garden for environmental education.  We have partnered with the city of San Jose for the  
Walk to School initiative, supervised by parent volunteers. Through the resources of SYNOPSIS and parent volunteers who 
coordinate and super

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Members of our staff monitor students on the school grounds daily for 10
-
20 minutes prior to the start of school ( 
depending on staggered schedule) and for 15 
minutes at dismissal. Teachers supervise and assist student crossing guards 
to stop traffic at crosswalks for students to safely cross neighborhood streets and monitor the students assisting in the 
area where parents drop off and pick up students. Monthly 
safety drills review staff and student response strategies 
school
-
wide for fires, earthquakes, and intruders. The staff has received Intruder Alert training from the SJPD School Safety 
Liaison Unit, and classes practiced the specified shelter in place safe
ty strategies. All visitors and volunteers must sign in 
when they arrive at school, wear a name badge while on campus, and sign out when they leave school. All Substitutes are 
given a sheet for review of our safety procedures in the event of an emergency w
hile the classroom teacher is not in 
attendance. A custodian and/or other school employee remains on site for all events held after school hours. The school's 
alarm system for fire was updated during July and August of 2012, and the security alarm is consi
stently monitored by a 
local security firm. All repairs of school facilities posing a hazard for students are addressed in a timely manner by the 
district's maintenance staff.

Individual school sites offer Supplemental Instruction (SI) to students who are below grade level. It is up to each individua
l 
school sit e to 
identify the students who need extra support based upon district benchmarks or teacher recommendations. 
Each school site selects certificated and classified staff to teach these SI classes, usually after school (1 

 
3 days a week). 
Each school also identif
ies the curriculum that will be used. The majority of the school sites select computer

based 
programs w here students can work independently at their current academic level. Some schools provide this time to 
receive help on their homework.

Professional Development this school year occurred on many different levels 

 
before school started (summer of 2019) 
and ongoing throughout the 2019 

 
2020 school year.  
The district office working with our site principals and curriculum 
leadership teams developed the scope/sequence of the professional development.  Leadership teams reviewed student 
data produced from benchmark tests, ELPAC, and SBAC data, as well as staff
 
feedback when developing the scope and 
sequence.

At the beginning of the school year, all certificated and classified staff participated in two days of professional 
development aligned to their instructional role and needs.  TK
-
5 teachers received traini
ng on providing effective Tier 1 
instruction in math and ELA.  Special education staff, social workers and psychologists received training on topics pertinent
 
to their needs such as All Learning is Social Emotional, TCI De
-
Escalation, Instructional Scaffol
ding to Assist and Support 
Student , and Data Collection and Behavior Management.  Middle school staff received specialized training related to the 
content they teach, that focused on the social emotional element of learning as well as recently adopted cur
riculum.  All 
middle school teachers participated in a workshop on understanding gender.  Training for new teachers focused on 

certif
icated colleagues in order to have the opportunity to collaborate while learning.  They also attended other sessions 
designed to meet their specific professional needs.
 
 
During the school year middle school, science teachers were released up to three days 
to collaborate on implementation 
of the new science program.  Middle school math and writing teachers scored and/or analyze student benchmarks during 
release days for each grade.  7th grade science teachers were released for 1
-
2 days for training on the di

comprehensive sexuality program.  Additional training was offered on release day for special education teachers to 
support implementation of our dyslexia curriculum as well as special education components of our ELA programs.
 
 
Throughout the schoo
l year, we offered monthly professional development sessions in which all teachers participated (1.5 
hours on 10 early release Thursday afternoons).  Principals and district office administrators chose the topics for the 2019
-
2020 school year in alignment 
with the District focus on developing a multi
-
tiered system of support.
 
 
The Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL) program was implemented at six of our ten elementary schools in grades TK
-
3.  The schools included were Cherrywood, Laneview, Summerdale, Br
ooktree, Toyon and Vinci Park.   Teachers in the first 
two years of implementation received three two
-
day training modules each followed by a day of unit planning.  Teachers 
in the third and fourth year of implementation participated in three days of unit 
planning.  Contracted SEAL experts 
provided the module training sessions and three district instructional coaches facilitated the follow up planning PD 
sessions.  Teachers were released from their classrooms for all of these PD days.
 
 
Four instructional co
aches provided BTSA induction training for all teachers who qualified to receive BTSA training and 
support. Additionally, BUSD teachers provide PAR assistance to teachers who are in need of additional assistance.  All 
teachers have access to an instruction
al coach so that they can receive follow up support on implementing new learning 
attended through professional development.
 
 
An MTSS committee and Differentiated Assistance Team received 3
-
5 days of training on change management facilitated 
by WestEd and t
he Santa Clara County Office of Education.  Some members also participated in 3 training sessions of 
equity.  Team members then trained principals during monthly professional development meetings.   The focus of both 
teams aligned with the district goal of
 
developing multi
-
tiered systems of support at each site.
