School Description
 
Established in 1997, Henry P. Mohr Elementary was named after Mr. Mohr a local farmer, school 
Board member and entrepreneur who played a major role in the agricultural development and 
influenced the social and economic evolution of early
 
Pleasanton. His legacy continues at Mohr 
where we persist in developing an innovative school that promotes exceptional learning 
experiences for all students through an on
-
going focus on teacher and student agency. Our school 
mascot, the eagle, is reflecte
d in our school motto:  ?Working Together, We Soar at Mohr! The 
school is located in the northeastern region of Pleasanton, California and is part of the Pleasanton 
Unified School District (PUSD). It is tucked in a lovely suburban neighborhood, surrounded 
by 
indigenous trees, where students are able to walk and ride their bikes to school. The context has 
changed since 1997 when the area was once farmland. Stoneridge Drive is now connected to the 
San Francisco Premium Outlets in Livermore, adjacent to Inters
tate 580. The area has developed 
into a vibrant community.  The school population is made up of approximately 660 students in 
transitional kindergarten through fifth grade. The diverse population at Mohr includes a range of 
ethnicities from many different 
countries with students who speak over 22 different languages 
represented. Twenty
-

students with 23% English Learners (EL) and 6% of students eligible for free and reduced lunch. 
With this
 
unique population we provide opportunities to celebrate all cultures through 
performances, conversations, and interactions that honor and appreciate our similarities and 
differences. We have many opportunities to work with our families who have varied wor
ld
-
wide 
expectations of education. We do this by building relationships, clear communication, and aligning 
a vision for student success.
 
 
Henry P. Mohr has a variety of traditions rooted in best practices. Our students, staff, and families 
come together, c
ommitted to our permanent goal; to see every child soar.  Mohr has been 
recognized as a California Distinguished School in 2000, 2004, 2010, and 2014, and earned the Blue 
Ribbon title in 2005.  It has received Honorable Mention for Excellence from the Cali
fornia 
Department of Education in 1998 and 2007. These recognitions come from our parent and 
community partnerships and commitment to innovative teaching practices, specialized programs, 
enrichment opportunities, response to intervention, and the on
-
going 
quest to pursue researched 
based practices that impact student motivation, learning efficacy, and overall growth.

Our vision at Henry P. Mohr has evolved with an on
-
going emphasis on creativity that is weaved throughout. In 2013, we focused on 
school climate and building u

Communication, Critical Thinking, Creativity and Collaboration. We also launched our school wide focus in Science, Technology
, 
Engineering, Arts, and Math (S.T.E.A
.M.). The S.T.E.A.M. focus prompted several new initiatives to support the Next Generation Science 
Standards.  Our ?Project Lead the Way? (PLTW) implementation and 5 year Technology Plan which emphasized students as creators
 
versus 
consumers of technology 
was initiated. In 2015, we focused on engagement with self (Mindfulness), others (collaboration), and learning 
(Metacognitive Strategies and Math Differentiation). In 2016, our vision was for all students to feel safe and respected. We 
launched our 
Positiv
e Behavioral Intervention Support (PBIS) initiative with a strong focus on student social and emotional growth. In 2017, our 
focus 
was on teacher collaboration to impact student learning through lesson design and delivery combined with assessment creation,
 
calibration, and analyzation. This emphasis on data prompted on
-
going conversations on student progress during Wednesday morning 
grade level collaboration time. The Impact Team, made up of teachers, helped facilitate the shift from coordination during te
a
m time 
focusing on individual student progress. In 2018, we advocated for learning spaces and environment to meet the diverse learni
ng needs 
of our students. Our deliberate pathway for creating a school wide vision (every year for seven years) has evolved 
to include high levels 
of instructional pedagogy. This has been achieved through the implementation of Inquiry Learning, Project Based Learning, and
 
Blended 
Learning.  We have increased student curiosity and real world learning experiences.  As a result, s
tudents have opportunities to extend 
deeper learning while providing systematic, engaging interventions reflected in improved overall student achievement.
 
 
Our vision moving forward is to implement the Universal Design Learning framework and emphasize educ
ational practices that provide 
flexibility in engagement and a reduction of barriers in student learning and instruction.  Our goal is that ALL students wil
l develop 
purposeful interest and motivation, increased effort and stamina resulting in higher level
s of learning, academic and social/emotional 
growth. Ultimately, we hope to inspire students to constructively contribute to our community and become dynamic, compassiona
te 
leaders.
 
 
About the 
SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local 
Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to ad
dress 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Instructional Materials
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum 
at Henry P. Mohr Elementary School are currently being aligned to the California State Standards.  Instructional 
materials are selected from the state's most recent list of standards
-
based materials and adopted by the State Board of Education.  The distric
t follows 
the State Board of Education's six
-
year adoption cycle for core content materials(English/language arts, math, science, and social science).
 
 
On Tuesday, September 24, 2019, the Pleasanton Unified School District's Board of Trustees held a public
 
hearing to certify the extent to which textbooks 
and instructional materials have been provided to students.  The Board of Trustees adopted Resolution 2019
-
2020.004,  which certifies as required by 
Education Code §60119 (1) that textbooks and instructiona
l materials were provided to all students, including English learners, in the district to the extent 
that each pupil has a textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient text
books and instructional materi
als 
were provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent 
with the cycles and content 
of the curriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English/language arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materia
ls used for their visual/performing 
arts curricula.  During the 2019
-
20 school year, Pleasanton Unified School District provided ea

Our vision at Henry P. Mohr has evolved with an on
-
going emphasis on creativity that is weaved throughout. In 2013, we focused on school climate and 

unication, Critical Thinking, Creativity 
and Collaboration. We also launched our school wide focus in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (S.T.E.A.M.). T
he S.T.E.A.M. focus 
prompted several new initiatives to support the Next Generation Scienc
e Standards. Our Project Lead the Way (PLTW) implementation and 5 year 
Technology Plan which emphasized students as creators versus consumers of technology was initiated. In 2015, we focused on en
gagement with self 
(Mindfulness), others (collaboration), an
d learning (Metacognitive Strategies and Math Differentiation). In 2016, our vision was for all students to feel 
safe and respected. We launched our Positive Behavioral Intervention Support (PBIS) initiative with a strong focus on student
 
social and emotio
nal 
growth. In 2017, our focus was on teacher collaboration to impact student learning through lesson design and delivery combine
d with assessment 
creation, calibration, and analyzation. This emphasis on data prompted on
-
going conversations on student prog
ress during Wednesday morning grade 
level collaboration time. The Impact Team, made up of teachers, helped facilitate the shift from coordination during team tim
e focusing on individual 
student progress. In 2018, we advocated for learning spaces and enviro
nment to meet the diverse learning needs of our students. Our deliberate pathway 
for creating a school wide vision (every year for seven years) has evolved to include high levels of instructional pedagogy. 
This has been achieved through 
the implementation 
of Inquiry Learning, Project Based Learning, and Blended Learning. We have increased student curiosity and real world learnin
g 
experiences. As a result, students have opportunities to extend deeper learning while providing systematic, engaging interven
tion
s reflected in improved 
overall student achievement.

Our vision moving forward is to implement the Universal Design Learning (UDL) framework which is endorsed by 
the state of California as a framework 
for instructional practices in Core Instruction.
 
 
This framework emphasizes educational practices that provide flexibility in engagement and a reduction of barriers in student
 
learning and instruction. 
Our goal is tha
t ALL students will develop purposeful interest and motivation, increased effort and stamina resulting in higher levels of le
arning, academic 
and social/emotional growth. Ultimately, we hope to inspire students to constructively contribute to our community
 
and become dynamic, 
compassionate leaders.
 
 
 
Decisions concerning selection of staff development activities are performed by all staff using tools such as teacher input, 
district benchmark results, and 
data analysis to determine the areas in which additio
nal teacher training may enhance classroom instruction and increase student achievement levels.  
Henry P. Mohr Elementary School supports ongoing professional growth throughout the year on weekly late start days.  Teachers
 
meet in grade level 
teams to cond
uct data analysis to identify areas of need.  Teaching staff are provided the opportunity to participate in district
-
sponsored staff 
development workshops or training session as 1) a supplement to site
-
based staff development, 2) for reinforcement of or fo
llow
-
up on previous training, 
or 3) follow
-
up training for newly implemented programs/curricula. Mohr Elementary offers support to new and veteran teachers through peer
 
coaching 
and mentoring. All staff are encouraged to attend professional workshops and c
onferences.  Classified support staff receive job
-
related training from 
department supervisors and district representatives.
