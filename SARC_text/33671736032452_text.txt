About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Vista del Monte is situated on a large plot of land adjacent to a city park. There are beautiful mountain views from all the 
outside areas. The school was 
built in 1961 and carries the 
unique distinction of being one of the few schools of that era to be built entirely of modular structures. There are 22 regul
ar 
education classrooms, about half of which are in portable structures. There are three distinct playgrounds for Kindergarten, 
1st
-
2nd grade and 3rd
-
5th 
grade. The facilities are in good condition despite the age of the school. The campus is kept clean and free of graffiti. The
re are two full time custodians 
(one daytime, one nighttime) and they keep the campus clean.  School grounds
 
and facilities are all in excellent condition considering its advanced age 
of 53 years.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority:

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 
The School Safety Plan is updated annually. Our goal is to pr
ovide and maintain a high level of safety, cleanliness, and order throughout the campus.  We 
maintain a safe and secure campus by providing a closed campus and having all volunteers and visitors sign in upon entering o
ur campus.  Volunteers 
and visitors ar

us.   We 
establish school
-
wide behavior expectations and enforce district
-
wide rules for student behavior and conduct.  We promote 
being good citizens on 
campus and provide anti
-
bullying lessons delivered in each classroom, as well as lessons to prevent cyber
-
bullying.
 
 
The School Safety Plan was last reviewed in December 2019.

Each year we have designed professional learning based on student achievement data, research of best practices and discussion
s with teachers and 
principals. The specific approaches vary by content area. For ELA in 2017
-
2018 the focus was on aligning instru
ction to Smarter Balanced Assessments, 
depth of knowledge, and deeper understanding of the Reading Targets in Claim 1. In 2018
-
19 the focus was on the gradual release model and High Impact 
math for staff in grades 2nd and 3rd.  High Impact math training fo

will continue to take place over the course of three years.  In addition, will be providing professional development on engag
ement strategies and training 
on Claim 2 for 
staff in grades 3rd, 4th and 5th.
