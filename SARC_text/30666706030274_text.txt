About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which de
scribes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information a
bout SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

All curriculum and instructional improvement activities at Hoover Elementary School are aligned to the California Common Core
 
State Standards. Staff 
development concentrations are selected and identified based upon 
student assessment results, teacher input, state content standards, and professional 
development surveys. Teachers and support staff attend staff development sessions after school, on release days, Saturdays, a
nd summer professional 
development days.
 
 
All 
staff development activities at Hoover are focused on increasing student achievement. During the 2017
-
18 school year, staff training topics at Hoover 
included: Safety Training, compliance items (child abuse mandated reporting, sexual harassment), Californi
a Common Core State Standards, 
implementation of our new Math Expressions program, Positive Behavioral Interventions and Expectations, inclusive practices, 
data chats, DIBELS score 
analysis to drive instruction (TK
-
3), and 21st Century Learning Skills (Col
laboration, Communication, Creativity, and Critical Thinking). Based on state and 
district assessment results, Hoover's focus was reading and writing. Teachers met individually with the principal to evaluate
 
MAP assessment results in 
both reading and math,
 
compare them to CASSPP scores (grades 4
-
5), and review DIBELS scores (grades K
-
3) to inform instruction. Our TEC support 
teacher reviewed previous District Theoretical Frameworks such as Academic Language Modules, Text Complexity, and Collaborati
ve Academ
ic 
Conversations, with a special focus on Making Meaning Through Writing. In addition, she provided staff developments in ELD us
ing the new California 
English Language Development Standards and four ELD Modules. Throughout the year teachers were provided l
earning opportunities in one hour long 
Staff Development meetings which included the use of specific LEXIA lessons and utilizing LEXIA skills reports to inform inst
ruction. Teachers were also 
provided release days to collaborate, analyze data, and identify
 
areas of need. In addition, our teachers all attended the district
-
sponsored Math 
Expressions trainings during the summer and release days. 
 
 
During the 2018
-
19 school year, our school sponsored 2 days of staff development. Staff training topics at Hoover
 
this year include: Safety Training, active 
shooter response, compliance items (child abuse mandated reporting, sexual harassment), California Common Core State Standard
s, implementation of 
our new reading Benchmark program, Positive Behavioral Interventio
ns and Expectations, data chats, and utilizing advanced LEXIA reports to inform 
instruction. Based on CAASPP, MAP, and DIBELS results, Hoover's instructional focus continues to be reading and writing, but 
this year an emphasis will 
also be placed on mathem
atics to ensure SBAC performance. Teachers will meet individually with the principal to evaluate MAP assessment results in 
both reading and math, compare them to CASSPP scores (grades 4
-
5), and review DIBELS scores (grades K
-
3) to inform instruction. Throu
ghout the year 
teachers are provided learning opportunities in one hour long Staff Development meetings which include state testing administ
ration training (CASSPP 
and ELPAC), MAP assessment administration, technology areas as needed, GATE identification a
nd referral, Illuminate training by the Research and 
Evaluation department, maximizing the use of our software, and health training and seizure response. During collaboration mee
tings and on release 
days, teachers will analyze student data to inform instru
ction. In addition, our teachers will all complete the district
-
sponsored Benchmark trainings and 
Irvine Math Project trainings during the summer and release days.
