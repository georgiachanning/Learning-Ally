School Description
 
Liberty Elementary School will be a safe and student
-
centered learning environment where 
students, parents, and staff will work and learn together in a spirit of courtesy and respect to 
provide the best available
 
instructional activities for all students.
 
 
All students will be encouraged and assisted to achieve mastery of the adopted curriculum 
standards in reading, writing, mathematics, science, history, visual and performing arts, and 
physical fitness through di
fferentiated, standards
-
based instruction, while promoting the 
development of life
-
long character traits that will enable the students to become good citizens and 
productive community members. Liberty offers a variety of instructional programs including EL
D 
for English Learners, honors opportunities for advanced students, and intervention programs to 
help students achieve grade level standards.
 
 
The staff will strive for continuous improvement in helping students meet high achievement 
standards by developin
g and implementing effective instructional activities and continuously 
enlarging their own skills and knowledge through professional development.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
The Liberty Elementary SSC, composed of parents and staff, meets to discuss student 
achievement 
and determine how federal and state funding should be used to support student learning. Several 
personnel and programs are supported by these funds. Trained bilingual paraprofessionals support 
English Learners in the classroom and work with stu
dents in small groups and one
-
on
-
one to 
improve reading skills. A Literacy Coach trains teachers in best practices and works directly with 
classroom paraprofessionals. State and federal funds also support learning with additional 
programs and materials to 
supplement core materials.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and 
comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic 
system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., 
the California State Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally 
provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of 
operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types 
of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Professional development has become part of the daily work life of the 
Kerman Unified teaching teams. Teachers, administrators, and support 
staff participate in workshops and seminars, coach one another, plan 
lessons together, and collaborate for the 
purpose of student achievement. 
The professional learning community understands that teachers need 
collaboration time with one another. As a result, there is much support for 
providing the time and resources teachers require for the purpose of 
changing the
ir practice. Teachers are afforded opportunities to participate 
in curriculum development, learn and share successful methods of 
reaching students, discuss comprehensive and efficient ways to implement 
standards, and continue their own learning. The distri
ct and the school site 
provide professional development days for staff. These days are devoted 
to curriculum training, discussing achievement data, and grade level 
collaboration. Staff also have the opportunity to attend out of district 
conferences to enha
nce their skills as educators.

Qu
ality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Liberty Elementary sets a high priority upon ensuring that there are sufficient textbooks and materials to support the school
 
educational program. 
Textbook selecti
on is done by the District, grade level, and subject area committees coordinated by the Assistant Superintendent of Education
al Services. 
All textbooks must be adopted from the most recent approved State matrices or local governing board approved lists. Te
xtbook purchases are consistent 
with the content cycles of the California Curriculum Frameworks as District IMF and other funding sources permit.
 
 
Categorical funding also allows us to purchase supplementary instructional materials for English Learners to 
accelerate pupils as rapidly as possible 
towards grade level proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking. These materials are used in addition to the basic Reading/
Language Arts and other core 
materials provided for every student and are correlated to St
ate Standards
-
aligned textbooks.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
An effective learning commu
nity requires the active participation of students, parents, and staff. The teachers and tutors at Liberty are highly trained
 
and experienced. They work hard to provide the best instructional activities to help students master the standards and will c
ontin
ue to develop their 
own knowledge and professional skills to improve instructional activities. Since the students are at school for a limited tim
e each day, there are important 
things parents can do: provide a regular time and quiet place for their student
 
to do homework; take an interest in the homework and other school 
activities; talk with the teacher frequently to check on their student's progress and to get tips on helping their student; a
nd support their student by 
setting an example in treating other
s with courtesy and respect. It takes the support of the entire community to provide an effective education.
 
 
Parent involvement is essential to our success. Children need strong role models in their lives. The Liberty Elementary stude
nts want your attenti
on and 
effort at their school site. At this age, parents have a huge impact! What students learn socially and academically now will 
influence their decisions in 
middle school and high school. Every activity listed here needs your help and support. Please c
onsider being a field trip chaperone, fall carnival organizer, 
classroom volunteer, attend Parent Faculty Club (PFC) Meetings, School Site Council, English Learner Advisory Council, and mu
ch more. Sign

se 
safety. Staff monitors the school grounds for 30 minutes before school as well as at all recesses and at lunchtime. Teachers 
re
gularly review the rules for 
safe, responsible behavior in school and on the playground. Fire, Lock Down, and Duck and Cover safety drills are practiced t
hroughout the year and are 
reported to the district office. The school has a safety inspection team th
at monitors the facilities once each quarter to maintain a safe environment.
 
 
The School Safety Plan is reviewed and revised annually; it was last revised in January 2019. The plan includes procedures fo
r emergencies, exit routes, 
and inventories of emerge
ncy supplies. Liberty makes the plan available and copies are kept in the office for parents. The plan is shared with all sta
ff 
during school
