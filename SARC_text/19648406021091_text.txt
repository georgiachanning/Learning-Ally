School Description
 
Welcome to Sanchez Elementary School. We are  proud of our students and the academic progress 
they have made in reading, language arts, English language development, science and 
mathematics. Through our combined efforts and focused instruction, Sanchez Ele
mentary students 
continue to transition to the new Common Core State Standards and are learning technology skills 
to ensure their success in the 21st Century.  Our school community continues to be committed to 
each student in their quest for academic achie
vement.
 
 
Our school mission, We are a school that prepares our students for future by helping them become 
active learners, responsible citizens, and critical thinkers, is evident in every classroom and in every 
other area around the campus.
 
 
We take pride 
in our professional development and professional learning community. Teachers 
have time to plan strategically for the needs of each of their students. Through teacher 
collaboration and frequent reflection on learning, our students will continue to gain the
 
access and 
support needed to become proficient in all academic areas. We also want to ensure that our 
students become citizens of character. As a school, we highlight a character theme each month 
from the Character Counts themes of Trustworthiness, Respec
t, Responsibility, Fairness, Caring and 
Citizenship. Students are frequently recognized for displaying these traits. In addition, we 
implement the use of PlayWorks during our recess time so that students learn to engage positively 
during unstructured activ
ities and, should they choose to, they can take on a leadership role as a 
Junior PlayWorks Coach.
 
 
In an effort to continue to strive toward providing a balanced program for students, we continually 
incorporate the arts during the academic day. All our stu
dents, from our pre
-
K special day classes 
to our general education fifth grade classes, receive music instruction. The PTA has also provided 
arts opportunities for our students by bringing in performers for our students to experience and 
enjoy and by parti
cipating in the Reflections Program each year.
 
 
We are fortunate to have an after school program at Sanchez: ASES Prep Academy. The program 
provides a safe and nurturing enrichment program to students after school for free.
 
 
We believe that a meaningful pa
rtnership between home and school only serves to strengthen a 
child's academic experience.  Parents are invited and encouraged to be part of the school by 
participating in our PTA, ELAC, and School Site Council.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information 
about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports 
for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); a

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

At Sanchez, we encourage and foster parent participation through out PTA, ELAC and SSC. Parents are an integral part of our S
chool Site Council, which 
works with school staff to make fin
ancial decisions and monitors student learning that impacts student achievement. Parents of English Learners are vital 
to our ELAC and to our outreach efforts on behalf of new families. The PTA fund raises and organizes fun events for students.
 
They also b
ring in activities 
to enrich the academic program, such as performance assemblies.
 
 
Parents are invited to join us in various activities throughout the year such as our Read Across America picnic, Muffins with
 
Mom, our yearly schoolwide 
Bar

Que, attendan
ce at the high school football game, training relative to social/emotional and academic success, field trips, volunteering in
 
the 
classroom, at home and around campus as well as others. We welcome all parents to Back
-
to
-
School Night in the fall, Open House
 
in the spring, and 
parent
-
teacher conferences in December and March. Parents are invited to attend our monthly awards assemblies, our monthly flag asse
mblies as well 
as our trimester awards assemblies. Parents can also receive recognition during our trime
ster awards. Between one and three parents are awarded for 
their contributions to the school and/or classroom. In addition, surveys are sent home three times a year to parents to ask f
or input on how to continue 
to make parents feel welcome and to facilita
te their involvement.
 
 
To ensure frequent communication, parents receive flyers as well as phone messages to inform them of any upcoming events. We 
also have a website, 
where parents can look at our calendar and other information.
 
 
We continue to work towa

School Safety Plan
 
We go to great lengths to guarantee the safety of our students on campus. Staff members, such as the principal, and supervisi
on aides, monitor the 
school grounds for 30 
minutes before school as well as at all recesses, at lunchtime, and after school. Teachers regularly review the rules for saf
e, 
responsible behavior in school and on the playground. We have a closed campus that is fully fenced. Visitors must enter the s
cho
ol and sign in through 

 
 
We revise our School Safety Plan annually. The plan is reviewed with all staff during a school wide staff meeting. The School
 
Site Council Team make
s 
final revisions and a plan is submitted to the district's Security Office. A plan is posted in every building throughout the 
school that includes procedures 
for emergencies. We've also created exit routes, and inventories of emergency supplies. A copy of
 
the School Safety Plan is in each classroom along with 
an emergency supplies backpack. Copies of the plan are available in the office for parents to review. Teachers instruct the s
tudents on safety procedures 
during emergencies. We conduct school wide fir
e, earthquake, and shelter in place drills monthly, and we run through a couple districtwide disaster drills 
annually.
 
 
Any visitors must sign in at the school office to ensure students are safe.

The team at 
Sanchez Elementary is working diligently to transition to the Common Core State Standards and are working on becoming a Profe
ssional 
Learning Community.
 
 
The team decided, after much analysis of academic data and professional discussion, to focus our profe
ssional development on math. District coaches, 
as well as our Common Core Math Leads, are providing the staff with trainings focused on math once a month.
 
 
In addition to receiving training at least once a month in math, teachers are being trained to becom
e a Professional Learning Community as well as to 
learn about the district's Instructional Practice Priorities. These trainings occur once a month as well. The teachers receiv
e at least professional 
development afternoons twice a month. In addition to this
 
training, teachers meet twice a week to collaborate and one to two days in the summer to 
plan.
 
 
Individual teachers, as well as grade level teams, call on district trainers to model lessons. Teachers also observe each oth
er's lessons to learn from each 
ot
her. These practices occur one to four times a year.
