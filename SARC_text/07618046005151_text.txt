About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Built in 1960, Vista Grande was completely remodeled and modernized in 1993 and again in 2006. The new 
construction funded by Measure A features 
a school
-
wide computer network, two computer labs, nine state of the art classrooms, a large media/library facility, a new science lab
, art room and a 
new multi
-
use room/performing arts center. In addition, the sta
ff lounge was expanded with conference room facilities. In the summer of 2018 new 
roofing, heating and air conditioning were replaced in the 100 and 200 buildings. Multiple areas on campus received new cemen
t and a few trees were 
removed from our quad area
. The PTA and the Town of Danville along with the District, funded a new playing field and resurfaced our blacktop play area 
in the summer of 2008. Our custodial staff and student volunteer helpers clean our school regularly and district personnel ma
intain
 
our grounds. In the 
summer of 2019, the 100 building and 200 buildings were modernized with new doors, windows, lighting, whiteboards, electrical
 
and wifi upgrades, new 
carpet in 4 rooms, and new stucco on the exterior. Part of this project which will be 
in the next phase is fencing around the perimeter of our school and 
our main office access will be reconfigured.
 
 
Adults at all recesses supervise the playgrounds and school visitors are required to check in at the office. All adults on ou
r campus wear sch

Strong Parental Leadership
 

-
Teacher Association, Traditional Prog
ram Board, Alternative 
Program Board, the School Site Council, Safety Committee, and the Computer/Technology Committee. Parent involvement at Vista 
Grande is a strong 
asset as evidenced by 20,000 volunteer hours, leadership on school committees, and donati
ons that fund science, art, music, technology, paraeducators, 
curriculum materials, instructional supplies and staff development. It is a high priority at Vista Grande to welcome and enco
urage parents to visit, 
volunteer, attend our parent education sessio
ns, and participate in decision

making meetings. Our site community liaisons are continuously looking for 
parents to volunteer in our classrooms. Throughout the school year, a variety of parent education sessions are offered. Topic
s are selected based on a

annual parent needs assessment conducted at a School Site Council and PTA meetings. Notifications are incorporated in our on

At Vista Grande, we are fortunate to 
have strong community support through the PTA and active parent involvement in the classroom. PTA fund raisers 
such as the carnival and art auction provide additional funds to support our library, science, technology, music and art prog
rams. Our Traditiona
l and 
Alternative Board sponsors a Jog
-
a
-
thon and multiple dinner nights to support paraprofessional time in all classrooms. An annual book fair is held to 
purchase additional library materials. Area businesses support the school by providing grant opportu
nities, tutorial support, guest readers and certificates 
for student recognition. Our local Rotary provides each third grader with a personal dictionary. Senior volunteers assist tea
chers in the classroom and 


After school enrichment programs such as academic chess, drama, dance, hands on Science, Spanish, Math Olympiad, and karate a
re available to all 
students. 
Kids Country offers before and after daycare to extend extra curricular activities. Our PRIDE Program is sponsored by parents
 
and our student

The San Ramon 
Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a comprehensive, inclusive model of professional development for all staff.
 
Our high 
quality professional development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy an
d instructional strategies. 
In 2012
-
13, we established district
-
wide K
-
12 Task Forces in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along with targeted professional 
development offerings. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University
 
Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and the Silicon Valley Math 
Initiative. Both organizations are highly respected and have strong ties to the development and implementation of the CCSS an
d professional learning 
offerings.
 
 
These learning experie
nces are supported with on
-
site coaching provided by a team of instructional coaches who work and train together. The coaches 
received certification as Common Core trainers through the Leadership and Learning Center. They provide one
-
to
-
one coaching, team 
and grade level 
coaching, whole school professional development, in addition to targeted cross
-
grade level, cross
-
discipline professional development sessions. These 
trainings connect to every aspect of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, in
tentional instructional practices, formative assessment for 
learning, and lesson design.

In addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach
-
led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting. 
These co
horts are both semester
-
long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for 
Innovators to Problem Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously.
 
 
We ensure that new teache
rs are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project (formerly known as BTSA). Our summer intensive 
trainings along with on
-
going staff development days and release day trainings deeply align with the needs of our individual schools and our
 
Framework 
for Excellence: Supporting Students and their Learning; Supporting Staff and their Work.
 
 
Under the leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to d
eepen their content 
knowledge, 
strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of responsibility. 
As a result, every 
staff member helps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the di
strict as a whole is enhanced.
