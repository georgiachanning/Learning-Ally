By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Valley View Charter Prep opened in the fall of 2014 as an indepe
ndent charter school. VVCP was founded by Pacific Charter 
Institute, a 501 (c) 3 tax exempt non
-
profit organization of charter school leaders in the Northern California area. Currently, 

rter schools serving a total of nearly 3,000 students.
 
 
Valley View Charter Prep offers K
-
12 students a personalized learning program. Every VVCP student has access to one
-
to
-
one teaching through student
-
tailored, standards
-
based curriculum. Valley View wa
s founded on the principle that 


age the 
flexibility of the independent study model to empower VVCP students to meet their educational goals.
 
 
Valley View Charter Prep has a clearly stated vision and mission based on its student needs, current educational research, 
and the belief that all
 
students can achieve the highest academic standards.
 
 
Vision 
-
 

-
motivated, educated individuals who will spread the wealth of knowledge worldwide in 

 
 
Mission 
-
 

charge of their education by connecting their individual 
needs and interests to a rigorous learning plan, thus creating responsible citizens, critical problem
-
 
solvers, and lifelong 

 
 

e Academic Triangle, defined by the interdependent 
relationship of the teacher, the student, and the parent. The dynamics surrounding this vital geometry assists in ensuring 
that the student and parent both realize the scope of the overarching goals for al
l students at the school. The teacher 
develops personal learning tools to successfully complete the curriculum. The Academic Triangle is the symbol for what is 
expected for each student in that it empowers each agent of the triangle to take charge of the e
ducational plan, regardless 
of the stability of all of the legs.
 
 
Both the Mission Statement and Vision present clear expectations that students become active participants in their own 
education and their future. The strength of the Academic Triangle lies 
in its essential ability to support students who may 
not have sufficient academic stamina or self
-
motivation at the time of enrollment. The teacher or parent may have to take 
on the greater role until the student progresses to expected levels.Further, the 


 
 
The vision and mission for Valley View Charter Prep work in concert to ensure that the 
school continues to strive for high 
academic results for every student. School administration regularly review student educational data to determine student 
need and alignment of student learning with vision and mission. Professional development organized 
in concert with and 
as a result of the review of student educational data. The governing board additionally reviews student educational data 
and approves policies that support schoolwide learner outcomes.

Academic Standards are central to schoolwide learn
er outcomes. VVCP implements and uses appropriate California State 
Standards
-
based curriculum along with standards based supplemental supports for all 9
-
12th grade students. We also 
utilize a variety of online support programs that are now aligned to Commo
n Core Standards and are California specific.
 
 
Additionally, VVCP addresses its schoolwide learner outcomes and academic standards through the implementation of 
the Academic Triangle model which ensure the fidelity of our Mission and Vision. This includes 
students that are socio
-
economically disadvantaged, English learners, foster/homeless youth, credit deficient, or academically challenged. We are 
committed to producing self
-
 
motivated students who develop an appreciation for lifelong learning.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Calif
ornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternat
e achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for e
ntrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

VVCP prepare students for college and career paths by using Career Cruising Skills, ICEV certificated courses and interest 
assessments to identify engaging courses and develop personalized learning plans for high school students. The online 
certificate pro
gram is embedded into elective coursework to guide post
-
graduation plans for navigating college and CTE 
pathways. 11th and 12th grade high school students have learning plans with a portfolio of Career Cruising Skills/ICEV 
courses and Interest assessments.
 
Additionally, 12th grade learning plans contain an Action Plan for one of three paths: 
Direct Entry to College, Community College Transfer or CTE program, Direct Entry into Career Path. Industry certifications, 
tested for on iCEV, are developed by industr
y leaders, reflect the needs of real

Valley View Charter Pre
p uses a range of methods to consult with and receive parental input. These methods are currently 
in use for parents that are attending VVCP. This includes but is not limited to parent, student, and teacher Academic 
Triangle collaboration, email and phone 
communication, parent and student surveys, parent participation in school 
activities, and parent contributions to school protocols development. Contact information pertaining to organized 
opportunities for parent involvement can be obtained through our mon
thly online newsletter or by calling our 
administrative office.
 
 
The Academic Triangle is a powerful and unique feature to Valley View in which the three major stakeholders; the teacher, 
the student, and the parent work together to develop solid academic p
lans for the student based on various criteria. The 

affiliations and relationships, and current status. Based on these criteria, the Academ
ic Triangle is best able to determine 
the intensity of the educational experience and the right combination of opportunities.
 
 
Parents and students are surveyed at least annually to determine their satisfaction with Valley View Charter Prep. This 
reflectiv
e survey will help the school make program modifications to better serve the students. The faculty, administration, 
and the board will review the results of the surveys to determine how VVCP compares to other schools in the region.

Professional Development at VVCP provides both breadth and depth on current 
topics in education. During the year we 
focus extensively on teaching strategies, data dialogues and student learning plans. We have taken these topic areas and 
have delved even deeper so that all teachers can apply their professional development learning 
to improve student 
achievement. A total of 9 professional development and continuous professional growth days were offered in 2017
-
18, 
2018
-
19 and 2019
-
2020, respectively for each school year.
 
 
We will continue to move forward with Professional Development
. We are embracing the new Common Core State 
Standards and implementing these this year and during the next few years. Our commitment is to make Professional 
Development relevant and timely so that our students benefit from what the teachers learn.
 
 
Valley
 
View Charter Prep conducts 2 days of in
-
service training at the beginning of each school year. However, an ongoing 
Professional development plan is in place for our staff based on a three
-
tiered model. District Wide, Site
-
Wide and 
Individual growth model.
 
This allows our instructional staff to achieve competency in multiple paths. With the use of our 
Common Core monies in addition to our general fund, the following focuses were developed with input from all staff 
members via a district
-
wide survey:
 

 
Common 
Core Professional Development which included the following:
 

 
Induction Program as well as the opportunity for teachers to access all County Office of Education Professional 
Development Opportunities.
 

 


-

by over 85% of the instructional staff.
