About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a 
School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Loc
al Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with 
data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about th
e LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or t
he 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Vannoy Elementary School is located in the 
town of Castro Valley, a beautiful community of rolling hills and canyons with mild winters and pleasant 
summers. Across the bay from San Francisco and just south of the city of Oakland, Castro Valley is a growing and a richly div
erse community with 
neighb
orly appeal.
 
 
Vannoy Elementary School was built in 1955 and underwent a modernization effort (2001) where all classrooms were wired for In
ternet access. In 
addition, each classroom was renovated with new floors, cupboards, counters, and paint. Playgrounds
 
and restrooms were also updated. One on
-
site 
custodian and a night team of custodians maintains our facilities.  District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs neces
sary to keep the school in 
good repair and working order are completed in a timely ma
nner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs 
are given the highest priority.
 
 
Further seismic renovations were completed in the summer 2011. In 2016, voters approved Measure G which will bring many impro
vements 
to the 
campus.
 
 
Vannoy will start Measure G improvements in 2018. In the Fall of 2018 we had four portables installed on our lower playground

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAA
SPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through e
ight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significan
t cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education 
sequences or programs of study

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil exp
ulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Campus safety and security are our top priority at Vannoy.  Our staff supervises students on campus before and after school a
nd during recess.  Our 
campus monitors 
assist with monitoring students during lunchtime and lunchtime recess. All visitors must sign in at the school office and rec
eive proper 
authorization to be at on campus. Visitors are asked by the school site staff to display their passes at all times. Van

is revised annually each Fall by the School Site Council, which is comprised of the principal, parents, and members of the Va
nnoy staff. Emergency drills 
are held on a regular basis; evacuation drills are conducted once 
a month, and earthquake and campus lock
-
down drills are also conducted. Vannoy has 
perimeter fencing as well as upgraded locks and cameras to help support school safety during school as well as after hours. O
ur current practice is to lock 
all perimeter acc
ess gates during school hours. Visitors must check in through the front office.  We have a dedicated Emergency Shed with supp
lies. Each 
year, we add more supplies to the shed. This year, the Vannoy Parent Club updated our Emergency Shed and reviewed our ou
r Emergency Supplies.

Professional Development is based upon District Goals and Objectives. Teachers and Staff 
participate in district Professional Development days as well 
as optional PD days. Vannoy staff participates in site based PD during our Staff meetings and Professional Learning Communiti
es. Our PD is focused on 
supporting our students and their needs.  We
 
offer PD in the areas of EL/ELD strategies, technology, English Language Arts, Math, Science and 
Interventions (MTSS). This year we are focusing on implementation of AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) and our 
continuing work 
towards equity, d
iversity, and student engagement in the classrooms.
