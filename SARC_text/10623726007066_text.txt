School Description
 
Pine Ridge Elementary School District is a small single
-
school district serving a Central Sierra Mountain 
community located approximately 45 miles east of Fresno, California.  Unlike many districts in California, the 
funding source for our district is generated by local property taxes.  When this amount exceeds the standard 
revenue limit calculation, it result
s in a financial label called Basic Aid. This type of funding affords our students 
necessary supplies, equipment, and technology.
 
 
The school provides educational services to students in grades TK
-
8, utilizing nine certificated teachers in the 
2019
-
2020 sc
hool year (including a Resource Specialist/Response to Intervention teacher and a Library Media 
teacher), six support staff, part
-
time instructional assistants, and one administrator. We pride ourselves on 
our low student to teacher ratio. It is our goal t
o maintain our small classroom averages.
 
 
The District is proud of the high level of community support it receives and the commitment the community 
shows our students. Pine Ridge is committed to student success and we achieve this goal through teachers, 
st
aff, and parents working together as partners in learning.
 
 
The five
-
member Board of Trustees reviewed its vision in August 2019 when it revised its Strategic Plan which 
centers on a safe and welcoming learning environment, academic achievement and enrichm
ent, Social
-
Emotional Learning and self
-
regulation.  At Pine Ridge, we are extremely proud of all our students and consider 
our school a wonderful place for learners to acquire a new level of pride, respect, and success. When you are 
a Pine Ridge Rattler, 
you are a member of the family.
 
 

 
 
Our Mission:
 
We work to enable ALL students to:
 
 

 
Experience a caring and welcoming environment

ident, and a lifelong learner
 

 
Demonstrate respect for self and others

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in
 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educati
onal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, 
data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardi
ans and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
edu
cation population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs 
items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
t
hat satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

State Priority: P
arental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Op
portunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents are a valuable asset to Pine Ridge.  Parents and the community are encouraged to be active participants in their chil
d's learning and in program 
decision
-
making. We communicate to parents t
hrough classroom newsletters, a weekly newsletter, flyers, invitations, automated texts and phone calls, 
and the school website.  Parents assist with many co
-
curricular programs such as athletics, student performances, field trips and fund
-
raising. The Pin
e 
Ridge Booster Club meets monthly to organize student activities and fund raising events.  The school and Pine Ridge Boosters 
provide opportunities for 
parents, students, staff, and community to gather at family dinners, fun nights, Craft Day, the Hallowe
en Carnival, etc.
 
 
The community participates in our elective program. This program exposes students to classes such as Origami, cooking, roboti
cs coding, auto mechanics 
and music. Offering interesting and worthwhile electives helps meet our goal of educat
ing the whole
-
child.
 
 
Pine Ridge provides formal and informal methods for parents to be involved in decision
-
making.  Goals and priorities are identified through the following:
 
The School Site Council convenes to develop and approve the Local Control Accou
ntability Plan, the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement and the 
Comprehensive School Safety Plan.
 
The Pine Ridge Booster Club meets monthly to discuss school needs, prioritize goals, and to provide support to the school and
 
surrounding community.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC
 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
All Pine Ridge Elementary School 
employees consider student safety, health, and well
-
being the foremost priority.  All staff are trained in CPR and first 
Aid. Monthly emergency drills train students and staff on procedures to follow in case of an emergency. Annual Facility Inspe
ction Tool
 
reviews guide us 
in maintaining the facility to avoid hazards to students and staff. The school has a closed campus; all visitors must sign in
 
at the front office and wear 
identification tags while on school grounds. School staff and administrators are on
 
duty during recess, lunch, and before and after school to ensure the 
safety of all our students.
 
 
The Comprehensive Safety Plan was updated, approved by the School Site Council, reviewed by staff, and presented at a public 
meeting in December 
2019. The pl
an contains all required data as listed in the California Department of Education Comprehensive Safe School Plan checklist.  
The plan is 
available for review in the school office.
