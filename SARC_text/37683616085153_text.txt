Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

All training and curriculum development activities at Rio Seco School support the implementation of Common Core 
Content Standards and State curricular frameworks. Teachers annually receive many 
days of professional development at 
the site and/or district level. Decisions concerning selection of staff development activities are performed by the principal
, 
district administrators, and grade level representatives using tools such as teacher input, d
istrict benchmark results, data 
analysis and focus groups to determine the areas in which additional teacher training may enhance classroom instruction 
and increase student achievement levels.  All staff are encouraged to attend professional workshops and 
conferences. 
Professional development is offered right after school or during release time. Teachers are supported during the 
implementation of professional learning by checking in individually, with the grade level, faculty meetings and district 
wide revi
ew. All staff are encouraged to attend professional workshops and conferences including GLADD, CGI, Restorative 
Practices, Open Sci
-
Ed, and CPI. Approximately 70% of our Staff Development is done on a partial day and approximately 
30% is a full day of Staf
f Development.Classified support staff receive job related training from department supervisors 
and district representatives.
