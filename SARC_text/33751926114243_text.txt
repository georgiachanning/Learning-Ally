Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The Vintage Hills Elementary School staff and community will work together to ensure that all students are working toward 
the achievement of academic excellence as evidenced in the successful
 
mastery of our State Standards. In our professional 
learning community, collaboration represents a systematic process in which teachers work together interdependently in 
order to impact their instructional practice in ways that will lead to better results
 
for our students. As a staff, beliefs and 
practices help to support our 21st century students develop as engaged and active thinkers who are able to communicate, 
innovate, collaborate and problem solve.
 
 
Vintage Hills was built in 1997 and has a total of 
52 classrooms including a computer lab and a library/media center. We 
have nearly 650 students enrolled and 66 certificated and classified staff members. The school was named a California

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most R
ecent Year)
 
 
Vintage Hills was built in 1997. We have 52 classrooms; 30 are permanent and 12 are portables. We have one parking lot 
and two pick
-
up/drop
-
off areas. Our school grounds, including buildings and restrooms are kept well lit, kept secure and 
cl
ean. For security purposes the school campus is kept alarmed when not in use.TVUSD's Maintenance and Operations 
division works diligently to ensure our facilities are clean and safe for students, teachers and staff. The district follows 
a 
comprehensive pre
ventive and deferred maintenance program to offset costly repairs and minimize disruptions to the 
instructional program. Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and bathrooms are clean and well 
maintained.  Our school has one full time lea
d custodian during school hours, and a night crew that comes in and cleans 
the entire facility after school hours. In addition, between two and three times a year the carpets at each site are steam 
cleaned.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
o
f study.

District Commitment to Learning for All Students
 
 
The Temecula Valley Unified School District is committed to ensuring that each and every child in its care receives a 
rigorous, multifaceted 
educational experience preparing them for the demands of college and career.
 
 
TVUSD teachers engage in active staff development throughout the year by attending:
 
 
In
-
District training sessions provided by staff and consultants.
 
 
Site
-
based training session
s presented during staff meetings and committee/grade level meetings.
 
 
One on one training provided during formal observations and post observation conferences.
 
 
Staff members are sent to national and state conferences to fine
-
tune instructional practices 
in specific areas.
 
 
Teachers with specialized training are given opportunities to train their peers, and provide instructional support as teacher
 
leaders.
 
 
Standards Based Instruction
 
 
Staff development focuses on implementing the New State Standards and state frameworks in English
-
Language Arts, 
Science, social science, and Math, K
-
12. Routine district sessions bring teacher leaders and principals together to devise 
and refine the curri
culum and assessments. Teams began by identifying priority and supporting standards, grouping the 
standards into units of instruction, and crafting common interim and summative assessments, developing scoring rubrics, 
and discussing sound grading practices
 
for each course/grade. Leaders return to sites to facilitate their grade level/course 
teams in reviewing the work, suggesting resources, and providing feedback for the refinement committees.
 
 
Collaborative Teams
 
 
Teachers are divided into Professional Lea
rning Communities (PLCs) based on content area and grade level. All 
instructional staff participate almost weekly during professional growth time meeting in their PLC groups to align 
curriculum, refine teaching strategies, create assessments, analyze stude
nt achievement data and transition to New State 
Standards.
