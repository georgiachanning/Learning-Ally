School Description
 
Emerson Elementary School is located in
 
the City of Rosemead near its border with the City of 
Monterey Park. It is home to approximately 478 students in Transitional Kindergarten through 6th 
grade as well as a Head Start program. Emerson Elementary is a Title I school comprised of a diverse 
stu
dent body: Asian
-
American students make up approximately 60.5%, Latino/Hispanic students 
make up approximately 34.7%, American Indian or Alaska Native students make up 0.6%, Students 
of Two or More Races make up 0.4%, and White students make up just over 2
%. Just over 50% of 
Emerson students are English Learners. Approximately 89.6% are Socioeconomically 
disadvantaged. 
 
 
There are currently 18 certificated classroom teachers, an EL Interventionist, an RSP teacher, a part
-
time counselor, and a part
-
time scho
ol psychologist at Emerson. Emerson teachers are determined 
to provide instruction and utilize classroom practices that will positively impact student 
achievement, especially in English Language Arts and Math. They are determined to offer students 
an authe
ntic 21st century education characterized by technology integration, STEM, computer 
science, student leadership, and visual and performing arts. English learners are a major focus at 
Emerson. Teachers and staff consistently discuss and implement best pract
ices, techniques, and 
strategies that will help close the achievement gap and help EL students qualify for reclassification. 
 
 
EMERSON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MISSION: The students of Emerson Elementary School will learn 
academic skills, moral and ethical values
, and a respect for diversity. These skills and values will 
enable them to be strong leaders who can work together to share their thoughts and ideas to 
provide creative solutions in an ever
-
changing society.
 
 
EMERSON 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL VISION: 
 
 
Each member of the Emerson community contributes to a safe, positive, and respectful learning 
environment where:
 

 
All students can succeed and meet their maximum potential as lifelong learners
 

 
All staff members strive to make a p

 

 
Leadership and creativity are encouraged and supported
 

 
All staff members guide students to make good choices
 
 
EMERSON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THEORY OF ACTION:
 
 
1. ENVIRONMENT & CULTURE 
 
 
If we create a safe, welcoming, supportive school environment that honors diversity, removes 
obstacles, and emphasizes positive outcomes for students, then we will establish a culture of 
collaboration, strong relationships, and pride in our school.
 
 
2. CHA
RACTER
 
 
If we emphasize positive character traits, follow the 7 Habits, and provide leadership opportunities, 
then students will become compassionate, confident, productive global citizens.

3. LEARNING
 
 
If we promote a growth mindset, foster creativity, and teach st
udents to work hard and persevere, then they will become determined, 
self
-
driven, intrinsically
-
motivated, adaptable critical thinkers and problem solvers.
 
 
4. RELEVANCE
 
 
If we focus on the whole child, incorporate Project
-
Based Learning and interest
-
based activities, and emphasize the joy of learning, then 
we will build happy, independent, lifelong learners who are inspired to teach themselves.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountab
ility Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and A
ccountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in
 
the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or th
e 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of 
study
