By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We are pleased to share our annual Accountability Report Car
d for Palm Crest Elementary School.  Palm Crest Elementary 
School is the academic home of approximately 675 students and a staff of 75 adults who come together daily to implement 
our vision of excellence in elementary education.  Teachers collaborate regul
arly to analyze and reflect on student 
performance data and guide instruction to meet the needs of diverse learners.  Strengths among colleagues are honored, 
ideas are shared, and innovative approaches are sought to build student character and self
-
esteem 
ensuring well
-
prepared 
and confident 21st century learners.
 
 
Our goal is to provide a rigorous, nurturing, and well
-
rounded education that meets the academic, social, and physical 
needs of our students and create a unique opportunity for all students to ga
in and apply 21st century skills that include 

-
 
Critical Thinking, Communication, Collaboration, and Creativity.
 
 
In addition to a challenging and meaningful academic instruction, students benefit from regular classes in art, music, 
drama, c
omputer technology, and physical education.  Regular integration of technology and cross curricular lessons also 
provide students with opportunities to access curriculum at a deeper level.  Furthermore, enrichments opportunities 
extend to optional Spanish 
classes to students in grades three through six as well as other after school enrichment classes 
and activities.

-
matter experts, and on grade level 
field trips as chaperones.
 
 
Additionally, the support of our La Cañada
-
Flintridge community enables PCR to have outstanding programs, which make 
a significant dif
ference in the lives of our students.  Working together toward a shared vision of high expectations for 
student achievement and conduct, enables our students to demonstrate personal success and become confident, life

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
Through the support of the district administration and the cooperation and efforts of the special education and 
general 
education staff, children with exceptional and special needs are receiving appropriate educational services. All students 
with special needs are placed into an appropriate educational setting and receive special support either directly in the 
gener
al education classroom or in a special education classroom.  Students qualifying for special education services have 
their Individual Education Programs (IEP) monitored by IEP Teams comprised of the school psychologist, a special 
education staff member, th
e child's classroom teacher, parents and an administrator or designee. Parents of special 
education students are encouraged to participate fully in developing their child's individual educational plan.
 
 
Gifted and talented students are identified yearly in
 
grades three and above. Programs for GATE students include pull
-
out 
weekly instruction and after school enrichment. Emphasis has been placed in areas of mathematics, science and critical 
thinking skills at the elementary sites.
 
 
The home language survey i
s used to determine the primary language for each student in the district. Students with a 
language other than English are assessed to determine their English language proficiency. If appropriate, students are 
provided instruction in English language devel
opment. Students with the greatest need also receive additional ELD support 
in the regular classroom and in small group settings.  The district and school staff monitor students' ELD progress through 
the school year.
 
 
Through funding from the PTA and Distr
ict, a Reading Intervention Program is provided to elementary students who are 
in need of additional support in the area of reading. The program begins in September of each school year and ends in 
April. Students participate in the program before or after 
the school day. Phonics and comprehension skills are the target 
areas for instruction.
 
 
La Cañada Unified School District is fortunate to have active parents and community who contribute generously to the 
schools. The Education Foundation has contributed o
ver $2,000,000 annually to the district in the last three years. These 
funds are used to reduce class size, contribute to part
-
time counseling services, fund the district librarian and provide art, 
drama, and music instruction to all students in grades TK 
-
 
6 and optional Spanish classes in grades 3 
-
 
6. These funds also 
contribute to district
-
wide technology and after school enrichment programs.

During the past three years the primary areas of focus for staff development at LCUSD have been the implementation of 
Common Core State Standards (CCSS) in Math and Next Generation Science 
Standards (NGSS) and training for special 
education teachers through the SELPA. Special Education staff attend 2
-
3 days of staff development during the year 
sponsored by the Foothill SELPA.  We have also paired experienced teachers with teachers who are ne
w to the LCUSD for 
mentoring and instructional support.  The annual number of days have varied from 4
-
10 days depending on teacher needs. 
Newer teachers require more days of professional development to obtain knowledge and skills necessary to implement 
the
 
new standards and the strategies that prepare students for college and career. Additionally, all teachers have been 
provided with the opportunity to attend trainings/conferences outside of the district.
 
 
The District has continued to work with organizatio
ns called, Teachers Development Group, to provide support to the site 
administration with evaluation and monitoring of the implementation of the new strategies. The District has also been 
working with the K
-
12 Alliance at WestEd to provide NGSS training to
 
teachers and administrators.  Due to ELA adoption 
in grades K
-
6, trainings have been provided to the teachers in those grade levels by the publisher to ensure smooth and 
effective implementation of the new textbooks/materials. Teachers have been piloting 
NGSS aligned materials and have 
been trained by the publishers to appropriately use the materials during the piloting period.
 
 
Eleven half days in grades 1
-
6 and five full days in kindergarten have been provided to teachers for collaboration 
throughout the
 
year. This time has been used to share best practices, design CCSS aligned lessons and projects, create 
common assessments, etc.
 
 
Training sessions have been provided within the district by Technology Integrationists in the areas of instructional 
technolo
gy, new assessments, CCSS aligned report cards and digital citizenship. Grade level and team leaders in extra
-
duty extra
-
pay positions also provide support to all teachers. Online workshops and trainings have additionally been 
provided to certificated and 
classified staff through Kennan and Associates and Alliance of Schools for Cooperative 
Insurance Programs (ASCIP).

Above and beyond regular trainings provided to all teachers, specialized training has been provided to Special Education 
teachers to address
 
the specific needs of students in Special Education. Several Crisis Prevention and Intervention 
workshops have been provided throughout the past three years to allow the teachers and paraprofessionals to work 
effectively with students with severe emotiona
l and social needs. Teachers and paraprofessionals successfully completing 
the training are certified for two years. Special Education teachers and service providers have received training on 
developing Individualized Educational Programs (IEPs) that provi
de educational benefit for students.
 
 
The Peer Assistance and Review Program as well as the Teacher Assistance Mentor Program have provided mentors for 
teachers who needed support in specific areas based on evaluations. Principals and colleagues have provi
ded support 
through staff meetings, teacher
-
principal meetings, peer observations, classroom walkthrough feedback and modeling of 
CCSS aligned lessons by teacher leaders and Technology Integrationists.
 
 
LCUSD administrative team is granted a stipend for pr
ofessional growth activities and has benefited from the opportunity 
to enroll in advanced level college courses and Association of California School Administrators (ACSA) academies. The 
District has provided sexual harassment training for all management le
vel positions and held monthly leadership team
