By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

instructional programs, academic achievement, materials and facilities, and the 
staff. Information about Orange Unified 
School District is also provided.
 
 
Taft School is one of twenty
-
seven (27) elementary schools in the Orange Unified School District. The school was built in 
July 1962 on 16.5 acres of land. The school is located on C
ambridge Avenue between Taft and Meats Avenues, just south 
of the Village of Orange. Taft School is on a traditional calendar.  Approximately 600 students were enrolled in grades 
transitional kindergarten through sixth including general education. Taft stu
dents and staff are fortunate to have the 
opportunity to learn from the variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds that make up our diverse population.
 
 
The Taft staff is extremely proud of the accomplishments of our students. Our teachers meet weekly to e
valuate their own 
teaching and the individual progress of each student.  We continue to focus on identifying and utilizing best practices to 
support reading comprehension, writing, and vocabulary development. We have increased our focus on mathematics 
thro
ugh individualized intervention or enrichment.  Our teachers use various assessments including school site and district 
level assessments to monitor progress and plan standards based instruction.  As a result of our commitment to academic 
success we contin
ue to close the achievement gap.
 
 
Vision
 
The school staff will build the foundation for student academic success, respectful citizens, and motivated learners to 
meet the demands of an ever
-
changing world.
 
 
Mission
 
Taft school staff is dedicated to fostering a safe, collaborative learning environment, setting high expectations for all 
students, and providing personalized instruction.  Our emphasis is on developing strong communication skills and sound 
decision making
 
abilities.
 
 

 
If Taft Elementary implements a multi
-
tiered system of support and strengthens our professional development, then we 

t includes 21st 
century learning.

-
t
ime day 
custodian and full
-
time night custodian maintain the site. The school grounds are kept clean and well
-
manicured. Taft 
Elementary was painted during the summer of 2015.  Playground equipment has been repainted, and updated playground 
equipment has b

The Taft campus includes 31 classrooms and the main office.  The campus also houses a library facility, a STEM lab, and a 
Speech and Language room. The only 
portable on campus houses the School Age Care program.  This portable meets all 
the safety standards (new electrical and new roof).  The entire campus has internet access.
 
 
Taft campus is a closed campus, night lights have been installed to curtail vandali
sm. Local youth athletic organizations 
continue to use the campus after school and on weekends.
 
 
The school was built in 1962 and is exceptionally well maintained. The custodian and principal make monthly site 
inspections and submit reports to the district
. The district makes requested repairs in a timely manner and schedules the 
site for deferred maintenance as needed.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: P
arental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Taft welcomes and depends on parents to be involved in the education of their children through volunteering in 
classrooms, participation in the School Site Council (SSC), English Language Advisory Council (ELAC), and the 
Parent/Teacher Association (PTA).  
Taft parents, grandparents, and community members actively support Taft programs 
by joining and supporting our PTA.
 
 
In addition to Back to School Night and Open House, Taft provides evening parent education nights two times during the 
year in literacy and
 
STEM to give parents ideas for supporting and monitoring these subjects at home. These nights provide 
fun educational ideas that are easy for parents to replicate at home.  Similarly, parents are invited to Math Mornings to 
learn strategies to support the
ir children in math. Parents also participate in parent/teacher conferences in the Fall.  During 
conferences parents are provided a copy of the grade level standards and the Home School Compact. In the spring we ask 
all parents to complete a needs assessme
nt survey and utilize this information to lead school improvement. Each trimester 
Taft has a Family Picnic and parents are invited to bring a picnic lunch and eat with their children, which builds a stronger
 
school community. Our parents also serve as "Gre
eters" before and after school as a part of our Gang Reduction 
Intervention Partnership (GRIP) Parents Supporting Parents (PSP).
 
 
Taft Elementary School also has two parent committees, School Site Council and English Learners Advisory Committee. 
The SSC is
 
a governance body and approves budgets and programs. They also oversee the Parent Involvement Policy as 
well as the Home School Compact. The ELAC, which boasts of at least 50 parents in regular attendance, oversees the 
program for English Learners. The EL
AC also receives training in how to understand school and district data and 
procedures.
 
 
Orange Children and Parents Together has established a pre
-
school program at Taft Elementary School.  Parents attend 
orientations, conferences, and activities to assis
t in preparing their children for kindergarten.
 
 
Trips to the surrounding community reinforce classroom learning. Some of these trips include: Orange County 
Philharmonic Society Performances, Anaheim Ducks Score, Mission San Juan Capistrano, Discovery Scie
nce Center, El 
Modena Nature Center, Centennial Farm and Inside the Outdoors. Some of these trips are funded through Grants obtained 
by the teachers. The Kiwanis of Orange also sponsors some of these excursions. Parents are invited to attend as 
chaperones 
and volunteers.
 
 
The teachers at Taft provide homework, newsletters, emails and notes to parents on a regular basis.  All school to parent 
communications are translated into Spanish to assist parents whose primary language is Spanish.  Taft has a community
 
liaison and several bilingual teachers who assist with translation and parent communication in their primary language.  
Teachers work to build an atmosphere that invites all parents to be part of their child's educational process.  If you would 
like to ge
t involved please contact Connie Smith at 714

School Safety Plan (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Each school develops and adopts, in accordance with Education Code § 32280 

 
32289, a Comprehensive Safe School Plan 
particular to their site. Each school site is required annually, by March 1st, to have reviewed, and if necessary, updated 
their Safe School Plan. Each school forwards its Safe School Plan to the district through the office of Student and 
Community Services. The office of Student and Community Services provides plan development assistance to the schools 
and maintains a file of
 
individual school plans available for inspection by the public.
 
 
A comprehensive disaster plan is in effect and fire and/or earthquake drills are conducted monthly. Taft is a closed campus, 
all visitors must check
-
in through the office. The school gates a
re locked at 8:00 a.m. and remain locked until the end of 
the school day.  All schools in the district are linked through an emergency radio contact system, and district radio drills 
are held periodically to prepare for an actual disaster. In compliance wi
th SB187, the safety committee has prepared a 
Safe School Plan, which is on file in the school office and is available upon request. Providing a safe environment for our 
students is of paramount concern. This Safe School Plan was last approved by the Schoo
l Site Council on February 11, 
2019.
 
 
The site administrator and teachers monitor students before school, after school, and during recess.  The staff meets 
quarterly to address any concerns and makes the necessary changes.  During lunch recess, we have fou
r superb supervisors 
that monitor students to ensure student safety.  The site administrator meets regularly with the lunch supervisors to 
identify any issues that need to be addressed.  To ensure student safety before and after school, the city of Orange 
provides a crossing guard.  The site administrator utilizes the School Messenger phone system and school newsletters to 
communicate our school expectations to help ensure the safety of our students.
 
 
We take pride in creating a positive learning environmen
t for our students.  At Taft, each teacher creates and implements 
a classroom management plan and provides a copy of their expectations to parents at the beginning of the school year or 
upon entry to the school.  Each behavior plan is designed around our s
chool's Positive Behavior Intervention and Support 
(PBIS) expectations.  Examples of components of our behavior program include: Taft Tiger Tickets (used for a weekly 
drawing), positive notes or phone calls home and assemblies to recognize students for aca
demics and character traits.
