School Description
 
Welcome to Juan Cabrillo Elementary School, a 


school is special because it caters to the academic capabilities and development of young children. 
We have
 
two TEDDE (Transitional Extended Developmentally Directed Education) kindergarten, six 
academic kindergarten classes, six first grade classes, six second grade classes, an SDC class for 
students with special needs and an RSP program to also serve students
 
with Individual Education 
Plans. The core curriculum at Cabrillo is built on developing critical skills in reading, writing, and 
mathematics, as well as building foundational knowledge in science and social studies, in 
accordance with California State Sta
ndards.  Our math teaching uses the principles of cognitively 
guided instruction, and our Language Arts program is developing the use of a workshop model. 
Additionally, we provide students with extensive experience in music, physical education, health, 
and
 
visual arts.
 
 
Juan Cabrillo Elementary School also offers students a variety of additional supports and services.  
Our English Language Learners are provided with a rich program of both integrated and designated 
instruction to meet their needs.  We also o
ffer a range of counseling and Tier 2 supports provided 
by our counselors, speech pathologists, and school psychologist.  Our focus on Positive Behavior 
Supports (PBS) teaches and reinforces positive behaviors at school, while our system of restorative 
con
sequences addresses misbehavior in a constructive, learning
-
focused way.  Students receive 
"Cub Cards" to acknowledge positive behaviors, and Student Success Assemblies are held to 
publicly acknowledge these students. The Cabrillo staff is committed to pro
viding an effective 
educational program that meets the learning needs of individual students. We rewrite our 
School 
Plan
 
for Student Achievement annually to address and embrace these needs.  Our goals this year 
include:
 
1.
 
Provide equitable conditions of lear
ning to all students through maintaining a clean, safe, 
and secure campus, guaranteeing access to highly qualified teachers, and  providing 
materials, programs, and curricula that ensure students are college and career ready.
 
2.
 
Develop college and career rea
diness for 100% of students through the implementation 
of California State Standards at each grade level.
 
3.
 
Increase parent participation in school activities and committees and ensure students feel 
safe and engaged while at school.
 
 
Our faculty engages in a
 
consistent cycle of goal
-
setting and reflection to ensure our programs and 
instruction are always evolving to best meet the needs of our students. Our leadership team of 
teachers, called our Guiding Coalition, lead our grade level teams in collaborative p
lanning and 
progressing monitoring.  Our school uses data gathered from ST Math, STAR Reading, STAR Early 
Literacy, Lexia, and STAR Math to help monitor student academic progress. We have a robust 
reading intervention program in place to identify and addre
ss the specific needs of students, as 
identified by our screening measures.  Our goal at Cabrillo is to maintain a nurturing, academically 
rigorous environment that provides all students with opportunities and supports to develop their 
academic, social, an
d physical abilities in a manner that promotes a life
-
long love of learning.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupi
l suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
We provide a clean, safe environment for learning at our school. Our custodial staff performs basic cleaning operations in ea
ch 
classroom every day and 
there is a regular schedule of ongoing maintenance.  Classroom space, library, office, and restroom facilities are adequate t
o support our instructional 
programs. Teachers and instructional aides provide playground supervision. Vand
alism incidents continue to remain low. Students benefit from a clean, 
safe facility that reinforces the high value placed on education by the school community. We hold monthly emergency drills fo
r earthquake, fire, lock
-
down, shelter
-
in
-
place, earthquake,
 
and fire preparedness. Each October we conduct a full disaster
-
preparedness drill, practicing all teams and 
procedures for student evacuation, search/rescue, first aide, and student release that might occur should an actual emergency
 
take place.  Followin
g this 
drill, the staff reflects on what went well and what improvements are needed. This feedback is given to the School Safety Sub
committee (a representative 
teacher from each grade level, school administrator, parent representative, and a classified emp
loyee) who meet to monitor and adjust our plan and 
procedures.  The most recent meeting was 10/24/2019. The Comprehensive Safety Plan is then updated each fall and reviewed eac
h year in February by 
the School Site Council (most recently 2/19/2019).    Pare
nts, students and staff are advised of any significant changes in the plan once it is approved. 
The Comprehensive Safety Plan includes sections on safety assessment data, child abuse reporting procedures, disaster procedu
res, school rules and 
regulations, 
suicide prevention, safe ingress and egress, nondiscrimination policies, and uniform complaint procedures.

We have a closed campus, and all visitors must check into the office before entering campus, having their IDs scanned through
 
our Raptor visitor 
man
agement system.  This system screens for sex offenders, alerts staff of custody violations, and provides schoolwide data and 
reporting on our visitors. 
Volunteers must take a TB test and attend a training session before they are allowed to work in a classr
oom on a regular basis. Each year staff members 
complete online training courses on pest management, sexual harassment, mandated child abuse reporting, bloodborn pathogen pr
otocols, and school 
intruder safety measures (through the ALICE Training Institute)
. In Wiseburn we are privileged to have wonderful law enforcement and firefighter 
support. The rapid response time of fire fighters and presence of our local law enforcement officers patrolling our neighborh
oods and schools is 
recognized and appreciated by
 
all.

Each year teachers are provided with 3 full days of professional development as part of their 
contractual school year, along with multiple opportunities 
for supplemental professional development.  Each Wednesday teachers have planning time for one hour, followed by one hour of 
professional learning.  
One Wednesday per month, teachers have the optio
n of staying for one extra paid hour to extend their grade
-
level team collaboration time.  The topics 
and focus areas for professional development are determined based on analysis of student academic data (STAR Reading, STAR Ma
th, ST Math, 3rd grade 
CAASPP
 
scores from our partner school), analysis of school survey results, and in consideration of school district learning goals an
d initiatives.  Professional 
Development focus areas and highlights over the past three years are as follows:
 
 
2017
-
2018: Using th
e support of a full
-
time Teacher on Special Assignment in math, the professional development goals revolved around bringing 
Cognitively Guided Instruction practices into all classrooms. Teachers created common grade
-
level assessments based on analysis of t
he California State 
Standards for Mathematics. Time during Wednesday meetings was also devoted to professional learning of the newly
-
adopted English Language Arts 
Curriculum.
 
 
2018
-
2019:  The focus this year was on continuing to develop and sustain Cogniti
vely Guided Instruction in math.  Teachers attended three lab days to 
observe math instruction and extend their learning with an expert.  They also attended monthly meetings to sustain their CGI 
practices using the Plan, 
Execute, Debrief, Reflect (PEDR) cy
cle.  In addition, teachers received training on guided reading groups and the Next Generation Science Standards.
 
 
2019
-
2020:  The focuses this year are on sustaining Cognitively Guided Instruction in math and creating a Professional Learning Co
mmunity (PL
C) within 
our school.  To promote teacher leadership in alignment with the PLC process, seven teachers volunteered to participate on ou
r school Guiding Coalition.  
These teachers have received three days of professional development, along with the school p
rincipal, on the elements of a PLC and team facilitation 
strategies.
 
These sessions all involved in
-
district training with hired experts. The Guiding Coalition meets twice per month with the principal to co
-
plan upcoming 
professional learning meetings for 
each grade level.  This provides an opportunity for articulation across grade levels.  These Guiding Coalition teachers 
then facilitate their grade level team meetings each Wednesday, guiding their teams through common planning, assessment creat
ion, data a
nalysis, and 
reflection.  The Guiding Coalition teachers also participated in professional development through the Cotsen Foundation for t
he Art of Teaching on 
sustaining our CGI math practices.   This ties together the two professional development goals o
f sustaining math practices and creating a PLC culture 
within our school.  Teachers also attended two days of math lab days in grade
-
level teams, as part of the math sustainability goal.  Teacher teams meet 
with grade
-
alike teachers from our other district
 
school to work with a CGI expert and observe her model math instruction in actual classrooms.  Other 
professional development topics have included NGSS implementation, social
-
emotional learning, and the basics of Writers Workshop.  Through a grant 
from th
e Cotsen foundation, seven of our teachers are involved in intense, ongoing coaching and professional development to implemen
t Writers 
Workshop in their classrooms.
