Principal's Message
 
Twin Creeks is a warm and welcoming place.  We are a 
community of learners including teachers, 
parents, students and staff. Our small population of approximately 575 students allows for more 
personal connections between students, teachers and families of Twin Creeks.  Our diverse 
population of students come 
from different socio
-
economic and cultural backgrounds.  Among this 
diversity there is a strong sense of community.  We are actively implementing a rigorous California 
State Standards  curriculum focused on meeting the needs of every student. Our parent co
mmunity 
enthusiastically supports us. Parents volunteer in classrooms, in the library, in the office and at 
special events. Our Twin Creeks Learning Fund works in concert with PTA, School Site Council, and 
staff to support the education of our students. Th
is support is evident in the funding of a Reading 
Instructional Assistants, Math Specialist, and Art Instructor and implementation of high quality 
events that engage and educate our families.
 
 
Our school is committed to meeting every child where they enter
 
the curriculum and providing a 
solid foundation from which to learn. Our Gifted and Talented Education differentiated classroom 
model has been expanded to include after school enrichment classes and lunch time programs.  We 
also have resources and social 
supports available for students so everyone feels a sense of 
belonging in our Twin Creeks community. These resources include but are not limited to our 
Rainbow Program, Friendship Circle, and our PAWS program which honors students for a positive 
attitude, 
acting respectfully, working responsibly and staying safe. Additionally, a partnership with 
the Discovery Counseling Center of Danville allows us to offer 2 days of individual and small group 
assistance for students working through social challenges.
 
 
Twin
 
Creeks is a dedicated, nurturing learning community that addresses the needs of the whole 
child. Classroom teachers create an environment where every student is honored for their unique 
contributions. Parent groups sponsor activities that promote and cele
brate the rich diversity of our 
community.  Student Leadership and Safety Patrol assist in developing future leaders as well as 
providing strong role models on campus.

School Profi
le
 
Twin Creeks is located in the city of San Ramon, west of highway 680. We draw our students from a residential community consi
sting of 
single family, side by side condominium, and apartment homes. Our school community is a diverse 
representation of lower, middle, and 
upper socioeconomic levels. The majority of parents work in professional and semiprofessional occupations.
 
 
Each year we celebrate our diversity with the International Festival. The International Festival provides our c
ommunity with an up close 
and personal appreciation of the foods, traditions, clothing, and facts that create the unique fabric of our special communit
y.
 
 
As a community we work together to create an outstanding learning environment, where everyone feels a
 
sense of belonging. We have 
accomplished this by beginning our Friendship Circle program, enhancing our technology within classrooms to meet the needs of
 
our 
digital natives, enrichment classes, and evaluating and restructuring our educational programs.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By Fe
bruary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fu
nding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
stat
e and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the 
school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Twin Creeks campus was expanded upon fifteen years ago with three temporary portable classrooms that were 
added to accommodate the lower class
-
size ratios in grades K
-
3. In December 2000, seven new classrooms were built at Twin Creeks to accommodate growth in the San Ramon Valley. New 
bathrooms were installed near the playground. Our play areas and fields incl
ude the San Ramon Twin Creeks Park, which serves both the school and the 

-
2008 in a Master planning process. During this time, plans to add a new Multipurpose Room along with redesigning 
and updating of the facility were
 
discussed. In 2008
-
2009 a committee was created of parents and staff to consider designs for a new Multipurpose 
Room. Construction began in the summer of 2009 and was completed in the summer of 2010. In October of 2012 the next phase of 
construction began
. 
The old Multipurpose Room was converted to a new library and computer lab, with completion in June of 2013. The existing libr
ary was then converted 
to a resource classroom, additional instructional spaces, new ADA approved restrooms, and a work room for 
the staff. A ribbon cutting for both new 
buildings was held in October of 2013. In addition to buildings, Twin Creeks has experienced updated painting, new landscapin
g, increased parking, new 
doors with specialized locks and some new fencing.  In October o
f 2014, discussions began regarding the modernization and re
-
design of the 
administration building.  This project began in the Spring of 2015. In Summer of 2015 work began on the modernization and red
esign of the administration 
building.  Our new admin bui
lding was completed in the Summer of 2016 with an official Ribbon cutting in August 2016.

The Twin Creeks School Safety Plan addresses the physical, social, and emotional safety of those in our school community. Thr
ough the 
development of 
clear, concise emergency procedures, along with ongoing training, Twin Creeks maintains an environment that is prepared for a

situation. Numerous programs including our Monthly Read Alouds, Sanford Harmony, SCIP Interns, 
The Rainbow Room, Friendship Circle, Guy'd to 
Greatness and EmpowHer address the social/emotional needs of the community.
 
 
The school culture is one that is respectful of diversity. Specific strategies and actions for enhancing our school cultural 
awarenes

outlined in our School Safety Plan, which was updated and approved during the Spring of 2019. Our plan is reviewed annually a

staff on September 2019.   It is updated according to needs identified through our si

The San Ramon Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a comprehensive, inclusive model of professional development 
for all staff. Our high 
quality professional development program is 
focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy and instructional strategies. 
In 2012
-
13, we established district
-
wide K
-
12 Task Forces in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along with targeted profession
al 
development offerings. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and t
he Silicon Valley Math 
Initiative. Both organizations are highly respected and have strong ties to the development and implement
ation of the CCSS and professional learning 
offerings.
 
These learning experiences are supported with on
-
site coaching provided by a team of instructional coaches who work and train together. The coaches 
received certification as Common Core trainers throug
h the Leadership and Learning Center. They provide one
-
to
-
one coaching, team and grade level 
coaching, whole school professional development, in addition to targeted cross
-
grade level, cross
-
discipline professional development sessions. These 
trainings con
nect to every aspect of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, intentional instructional practices, formative ass
essment for 
learning, and lesson design.
 
 
In addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach
-
le
d cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting. 
These cohorts are both semester
-
long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for 
Innovators to Problem Solving Strategies. T
here are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously.
 
 
We ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project (formerly known as BTSA). Our s
ummer intensive 
trainings along with on
-
going staff development days and releas
e day trainings deeply align with the needs of our individual schools and our Framework 
for Excellence: Supporting Students and their Learning; Supporting Staff and their Work.

Under the leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of p
ractices afford our staff the opportunity to deepen their content 
knowledge, strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of respo
nsibility. As a result, every 
staff member helps to promote and n
urture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the district as a whole is enhanced.
