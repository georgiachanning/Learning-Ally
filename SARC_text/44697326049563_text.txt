By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

 
The School Accountability Report Card was established by Proposition 98, an initiative passed by California voters in 
November of 1988. The Report Card provides a variety of information about the school, its resources, its successes, and 

School has a so
lid record of academic achievement, a staff that is professionally skilled and committed to meeting the 
needs of its students, and a program that sets high standards for both the personal development and the intellectual 
growth of students. It is our goal 
to provide a thoughtful, meaning
-
centered curriculum, exemplary instruction, and a 
healthy environment for learning. We want Bonny Doon students to be engaged in and excited about learning on a daily 
basis.
 
 
Vision Statement
 
The Bonny Doon School Communit
y will create a learning environment that challenges and supports students to achieve 

-
being to provide a successful learning 
experience.
 
 
Bonny Doon School Theory in Action
 
If w
e work together as a cohesive staff to provide a safe learning environment and create appropriate, rigorous 
expectations that tap into student interests and passions, then students will develop the agency and critical thinking skills
 
needed to challenge th
emselves to go above and beyond to solve real world problems both independently and 
collaboratively. As a result, our students will be prepared for success at their next stages in life and school.
 
 
Our Core Values
 
 
We believe that:
 

 
Learning occurs best 
in a healthy, safe, and nurturing environment.
 

 
Commitment from students, home, school, and community is essential to student success.
 

 
High standards and expectations foster greater academic achievement.
 

 
A highly skilled, enthusiastic, and dedicated staff h

learning.
 

 
Everyone should be treated with kindness and respect.
 

 
The development of self esteem is critical to student success.
 

 
Community building and peaceful conflict resolution are an integral par
t of the curriculum.
 

 
It is our duty to cultivate a life
-
long love of learning in our students and staff.
 

 
There is strength and value in diversity, and diversity should be celebrated.
 

 
Active, timely communication is needed to build alliances with the 
entire community.
 

 
An appreciation and respect for the natural world is necessary to becoming responsible world citizens.
 

 
Continuous improvement is necessary to meet the needs of students in a changing world.

Community & School Profile
 
For more than half a
 
century, the children of Bonny Doon have been schooled close to their homes. In the nineteenth 
century, several one
-
room schools, including Alba, Bald Mountain, Ocean View and San Vincente provided an education 
for the children of this remote area. Respon
ding to a swift rise in population after the second world war, these small 
schools were absorbed into the newly formed Bonny Doon Union Elementary School District in 1947.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September, 2019
 
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 19th, 2019, and determined that each school within t
he district 
had sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned 
textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home.
 
 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textb
ooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended mate
rials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption.
 
 
The table displays information collected in January 2017 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Bonny Doon School was originally founded in 1947 and 
has since undergone complete modernization. Recent renovations 
to the campus include a new roof and the remodel of a substandard classroom into a dedicated science classroom. At the 
beginning of the 13/14 school year, a solar voltaic energy system was inst
alled.  This system now provides most of the 
power necessary to operate the school. The campus is currently comprised of 13 classrooms (including portables), a 
library, one staff room, a multi
-
purpose room, three playgrounds, one office, and one after
-
scho
ol program room. The 
chart displays the results of the most recent school facilities inspection.

Bonny Doon School provides a safe, clean, and functional learning environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The 
district governing board has adopted cl
eaning standards for the school. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily 
basis throughout the school year with emphasis on classrooms and restrooms. A joint effort between students and staff 
helps keep the campus clean and litter
-
free. The Super
intendent/Principal works daily with a full time Operations Manager 
to develop cleaning schedules that ensure a clean and safe school.  A scheduled maintenance program is administered by 

 
maintenance functions occurring during vacation 
periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that school grounds and 
facilities remain in excellent repair. A work order process is used to ensure efficien
t service when issues arise, with 
emergency repairs given the highest priority.  The district maintains a deferred maintenance budget for larger facilities 
repair and maintenance needs. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning,
 
electrical systems, 
interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
For 2019
-
2020, Bonny Doon Union Elementary School District budgeted $13,949 for the deferred maintenance program.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Bonny Doon School Safety Plan includes detailed instructions for responding to a number of different 
emergency 
situations. It also outlines safety precautions taken at the school on a daily basis. The plan reviews school procedures and 
guidelines that support student safety and well
-
being, both outside on the playground and in the classroom.
 
 
The safety o
f students and staff is a primary concern at Bonny Doon School. Students are supervised before school and 
during recesses and lunch by certificated staff, classroom aides, and four noon yard duties. There is a designated area for 
student drop
-
off and pick
-
up in front of the school. All visitors are required to check in at the main office where they are 
given badges that must be displayed at all times.
 
 
The School Site Safety plan is revised regularly by the Safety Committee and the School Site Council.
 
 
Key
 
elements of the safety plan include implementation of the Safe School Plan, and emergency closure and evacuation 
procedures. The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state 
earthquake standards

a disaster. Fire, earthquake and intruder alert drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year.
 
 
Students at Bonny Doon School are 
guided by specific rules and classroom expectations that promote respect, 
cooperation, courtesy, and acceptance of others. Parents and students are informed of school rules and policies at the 
beginning of each school year through the student/parent handbo

Appropriate behavior is encouraged through praise and motivational incentives, as well as assertive discipline and conflict 
resolution tools to further develop personal growth. The school practices the Tr
ibes discipline program which focuses on 
conflict resolution techniques.
 
 
Suspensions and expulsions are generally expressed in terms of total infractions, not total number of students, as some 
students may have been suspended on several occasions. Expulsi
ons occur only when required by law or when all other 
alternatives are exhausted.

Staff members build teaching skills and concepts through participation in learning about and implementation of the 
Common Core State Standards. A team of five staff members attended the Computer Using 
Educators (CUE) conference 
in March of 2016 where they focused on using technology as an innovative tool to improve instruction and student 
learning.  In the spring of 2019, a team attended the CUE conference again. Upon return, these teachers shared what 
they 
learned with the rest of the staff. In addition, teachers meet every Wednesday afternoon for professional development. 
On these Wednesdays, teachers plan lessons together, analyze student work and assessment results, plan interventions, 
research topic
s in education, and explore new uses for technology in the classroom. They also collaborate to plan special 
lessons, field trips, and events throughout the school year.
 
 
Certificated staff are provided with one professional development day before the first
 
day of school in the fall and two 
during the school year. Topics are based on assessment results and need (learning new standards and curriculum). Seven 
out of eight classroom teachers, plus the resource teacher participated in intensive training with the
 
Silicon Valley Math 
Initiative (SVMI)  during Summer, 2016 as well as during follow
-
up sessions throughout the 2016/2017 school year. In Fall, 
2017, teachers learned more about the communication tool Seesaw, as well as developed and refined the school's S
TARS 
initiative. February, 2018 professional development was focused on Readers and Writers Workshop.  During 2017
-
2018 
school year, our teachers continued to participate in professional development to support continued implementation of 
Readers and Writer
s Workshop.  Additionally, during the 2018
-
2019 school year, classroom teachers are participating in 
professional development in problem
-
based mathematics instruction.  Our staff is also working to implement Next 
Generation Science Standards as part of the
 
county
-
wide BaySci initiative.  During the 2018
-
2019 and 2019
-
2020 school 
years, teachers leaders are participating in a county
-
wide science initiative.  During the 2019
-
2020 school year, staff also 
is working with a hired math coach to learn and implemen
t math instruction through a problem
-
solving approach.
