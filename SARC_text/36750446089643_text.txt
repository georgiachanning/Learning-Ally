By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to 
publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to pre
pare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consis
tent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and communi
ty members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dat
aquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE
 
As principal, I 
have the unique privilege of introducing you to the Annual School Accountability Report Card for Mesa

will prove useful in informing you ab
out our school and community, including but not limited to; demographics, 
achievements, progress evaluation, ongoing goal realization, discipline, budget, and facility enhancement.
 
 
In accordance with Proposition 98, every school in California is required 
to issue an annual School Accountability Report 
Card. However, we view this as not only a means of complying with the state legislature, but as an opportunity to keep

informed. We desire to keep the lines of c
ommunication open and 
welcome any suggestions, comments, or questions you may have. It is the opinion of the district, myself in particular, that 
a well

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
SCHOOL FACILITIES AND SAFETY
 
Mesa 
Grande Elementary provides a safe, clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance and 
campus supervision. Original facilities were built in 1976; ongoing maintenance and modernization efforts ensure facilities 
remain safe and up
-
to
-
da
te and provide adequate space for students and staff. Throughout the years, portable classrooms 
have been added to accommodate increased growth in enrollment. The campus is comprised of the following:
 
Acreage = 10 acreages
 
Square Footage = 38,846
 
Number of
 
permanent classrooms = 25
 
Number of portable classrooms = 20
 
Number of restrooms (student use) = 12 sets
 
Library = 1
 
Cafeteria/Multipurpose Room = 1
 
Music Room = 1
 
Health Office = 1
 
Staff Work Room/Lounge = 1
 
Health and Medicine Lab 
-
 
4 classrooms
 
 
CAMPUS
 
SUPERVISION
 
Proctors supervise the crosswalks and help students safely cross the street before and after school. Each morning, before 
school starts, both administrators and five proctors are assigned to designated areas of the campus to supervise students
 
as they enter school grounds. During recess, proctors are on the playground to monitor behavior and playground activities. 
Proctors and administrators provide supervision during the lunch recess and monitor both cafeteria and loading area, 
student pickup 
area, and on
-
campus after
-
school programs to ensure students leave campus safely. Teachers and 
administration assist with end of day dismissal of students.
 
 
CAMPUS MAINTENANCE
 
The custodial staff, site administration, and district's maintenance department 
work together to ensure playgrounds, 
classrooms, and campus grounds are well
-
maintained and kept safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. 
Administration and custodians communicate daily regarding maintenance issues and special projects; hand
-
held walkie
-
talkies enhance two
-
way communication efforts and help facilitate an immediate response to emergency situations.
 
 
One full
-
time day custodian and two full
-
time evening custodians are assigned to Mesa Grande Elementary. Every 
morning, 
before school begins, the custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards and other conditions that need attention 
prior to students and staff entering school grounds. As part of the routine responsibilities, the day custodian keeps 
bathrooms, cafeteria, 
and campus grounds clean throughout the day. The evening custodians clean classrooms, desks, 
restrooms, and are responsible for the setting up and the taking down of equipment and/or furniture for afternoon and 
evening events.
 
 
Mesa Grande Elementary works
 
closely with the district's Maintenance and Operations department (M&O) for larger 
projects, routine facilities maintenance projects, and school inspections. M&O employs a work order process that enables 
Mesa Grande to communicate unscheduled maintenance 
needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Emergency situations 
are regularly resolved in one hour or less.
 
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a 
dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to a
ssist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school 
building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or 
exterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
Planned or recently completed facilities improvements:
 
Renovate drinking fountains throughout school
 
Paint rooms 12, 13, 5, 2 and custodian room

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for 
students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the admini
stration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successf
ully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students tested 
includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of students test
ed 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted
 
using only students who received 
scores.

All professional development activities in Hesperia Unified School District revolve around the new State Standards and 
Frameworks and are research
-
based.
 
 
The Certificated staff builds teaching skills and concepts through participation in ongoing training sponsored by the distric
t 
and school site. During the 2017
-
18 school year, the district is providing staff development 
through district coaches and 
the Curriculum and Instruction Department. Each school site identifies and coordinates its own staff development 
activities based upon individual student needs, school site plans, and the districts designated focus areas. Some 
of the 
staff developments that Mesa Grande is training in are Daily 5, CAFE, PLCs, LLI, new State Standards, 21st Century Skills, 
Unit Plans,writing across curricular areas, Project/Problem based learning,  and differentiation. Mesa is focusing on 
creativi
ty, critical thinking, collaboration and communication. Mesa Grande has adopted a focus on Health and Medicine.  
Supplemental training involving curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies in the content areas of 
reading/language arts and math were 
provided at site request via Coordinator of Staff Development and Academic 
Coaches.
 
 
Supplemental training topics were selected by the principal, assistant principal, lead team and School Site Council. Training
 
programs and topics were chosen based upon th
e school focus and student needs. Results for Common Formative 
Assessments, Site Based Single Assessments, teacher feedback, and findings from classroom observations help identify 
areas for improvement and training programs that will enable teachers to del
iver a challenging and rigorous standards
-
based education fostering student success and proficiency. Results from the Smarter Balanced Assessment will also be 
referenced to assist with identifying areas of strength and need.
 
 
The district supplements site
-
level professional development to follow up and support year
-
round and ongoing programs 
centered on the district's focus areas of reading and math. Supplemental professional development is offered throughout 
the school year on early student release days, a
fter school trainings, during summer vacation, and on weekends. Teachers 
are provided days to collaborate in PLC teams. Staff development topics and focus areas are identified and selected based 
upon input from the district's Professional Development Commi
ttee, Principals' Roundtable, and teacher survey results. 
The Professional Development Committee meets four times a year to review student test results from state and district 
assessments and review teacher survey needs. The Principals' Roundtable provides
 
opportunities for school principals to 
discuss and share training needs based upon data analysis and classroom observations from each school site.
 
 
New teachers receive intensive support and training through the district's Induction Program and New Teache
rs Academy. 
For beginning and out
-
of
-
state teachers, the district utilized the state Induction Program (formerly known as Beginning 
Teacher Support and Assessment), a statewide and state
-
mandated research
-
based program providing support and skill 
building 
through formative assessment and individualized support based on assessment. The New Teachers Academy 
sponsors three new teacher orientations each year to support year
-
round hiring practices; the orientation is a 
comprehensive overview of the district's po
licies, school law, English language learners support, curriculum, instruction, 
and grade
-
level and content area specialties.
