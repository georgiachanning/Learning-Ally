About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School
 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Con
trol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data r
eported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF
 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
dis
trict office.

l Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter B
alanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible stud
ents 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The per
centage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (Scho
ol Year 2018
-
19)
 
Here at Rio Del Oro, we place a huge emphasis on parent involvement.  We know that parent support affects how students grow a
cademically, socially, 
and emotionally. We welcome parents to volunteer during school events, with classroom proje
cts, and they have the opportunity to volunteer as a 
chaperone on field trips.
 
 
In addition, our PTO (Parent Teacher Organization) is always looking for parent volunteers!  The PTO sponsors the Annual Harv
est Festival, Pastries with 
Parents, Teacher Apprec
iation Week, and other activities throughout the year. Many of these are community events that families participate in togeth
er. 
The others events are fundraisers. The proceeds from theses fundraisers go back into the classroom to support students and th
ei
r learning. To get 
involved with the Rio Del Oro PTO, go to www.facebook.com/RioDelOroPto or email them at rioptok5@gmail.com.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Rio Del Oro takes proactive measures to protect the safety of all our students and staff members. Staff members attend safe s
chools trainings each year 
to keep up
 
to date on new procedures and policies. School representatives collaborate to develop and maintain plans for coping with a va
riety of 
emergency response situations. Our emergency and safety plans are regularly reviewed and updated. In addition, school per
sonnel practice drills on a 
regular basis so that staff and students are prepared in the event of an emergency.
