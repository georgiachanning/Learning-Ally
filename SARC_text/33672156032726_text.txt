By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Monroe Elementary School is responsible for educating approximately 700 students in the community in grades preschool 
through the sixth grade.
 
 
 
The Monroe Elementary School community shares respons
ibility for the education of each and every student. Parents, 
teachers, and students work collaboratively to ensure that all students have the essential skills and knowledge needed to 
succeed and achieve in public education.  Students are expected to reach
 
or exceed current State Standards established 
for their grade levels. Additional focus is given to developing 21st Century skills including: critical thinking, effective 
communication, problem solving, and the ability to access information. Success is mea
sured with both formative and 
summative assessments.
 
 
 
Monroe is a Custom School (Personalized Learning). We believe personalized learning can enable every Monroe Scholar 
to be a self directed individual where the world is their classroom. The guiding beli
ef for personalized learning builds on 
our school vision and mission. At Monroe, instructional practices begin and end with individualized goals that are based 
on the standards. The intent behind our entire focus is to have students own and lead their lear
ning. We believe when 
students understand their learning styles, strengths, weaknesses, and feel a sense of urgency for achievement, success 
will follow. We hope to develop our students as a group of socially engaged contributors who see themselves as pivo
tal 
members in their community.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
