By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
North Verdemont Elementary School, the unofficial "Jewe
l of the District," is set in the foothills of the San Bernardino 
mountains. Our 32 classrooms, library, multipurpose room, playground, and administration building provide ample space 
for instruction and recreation while looking out at the beautiful San Be
rnardino valley and the tree
-
lined mountains. The 
campus was built in 1990, and our unique facility strongly supports teaching and learning through traditional methods, as 
well as hands
-
on learning opportunities with our 1:1 technology and opportunities to
 
learn in our working garden and 
pond. Additionally we are an Environmental Education magnet school, and students have the benefit of classes with our 
Environmental Education teacher at least twice monthly, helping them learn to appreciate and how to prote
ct the 
beautiful planet we live on and the beautiful environment we live in.
 
 
Everyone is a learner and everyone is a teacher at North Verdemont Elementary School. Our goal is to provide high quality 
academic instruction to all students empowering our scho
lars to develop skills, knowledge, and social understanding
--
promoting personal development and maturity

supporting lifelong learning. We know that real achievement comes from 
hard work over time and the resulting self
-
esteem and confidence is a direct res
ult of that hard work.

Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
 
The campus of North Verdemont Elementary School is referred to by many people as the ""Jewel of the District."" Set in 
the foothills of the San Bernardino mountains, our 32 classroom
s, library, multipurpose room, and administration office 
look out onto either the San Bernardino valley or the tree
-
lined mountains. The campus was built in 1990, and the unique 
facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample classroom a
nd playground space, a focus on using 
powerful 21st century technology, and a tremendous working garden.
 
 
The district takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the dis

Mobile Maintenanc
e Teams use the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT), a survey instrument developed by the State of California 

Operations Department. The most r
ecent inspection took place on 2/4/19. Below is more specific information on the 
condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are provided with an appropriate learning 
environment. 
 
 
Safety
 
To ensure student safety before, during an
d after the school day, rec aides, teachers, and administrators supervise the 
school grounds including the cafeteria, quad area, and athletic fields. Signs are posted throughout the campus to indicate 
all visitors must report to and register in the adminis
tration office. All staff and visitors wear appropriate identifying 
badges. 
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 

are proactive and conduct inspections to
 

each site reports safety issues as they arise. Maintenance and Operations make necessary repairs to ensure that all schools 
are clean, safe, and functional. A work order 
process is used to ensure efficient service and emergency repairs are given 
the highest priority and work orders are completed in a timely manner. 
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 

cipal or designee to develop cleaning runs 
for the site custodian(s). The site principal/designee then works with the site custodian(s) to ensure proper 
implementation of the cleaning runs to maintain a safe and clean school.

on the playground, office helpers, and as chaperones for field trips. We also host several evening programs, such as Math 
& Science Night, PTA's Fall Festival, and student perfo
rmances. We are looking forward to soon adding opportunities for 
our community members to enrich our students' experience through master classes and workshops that speak to their 
own expertise, and hosting Coffee with the Principal.
 
 
At the district level,
 
each school provides multiple options for parents to participate in the educational process.  
Opportunities vary from site to site but include parent centers, parent education programs, Parent Teacher Association 
(PTA), School Site Council (SSC), English 
Learners Advisory Committee (ELAC), Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) 
Advisory Committee, African American Parent Advisory Council (AAPAC), homework hotlines, auto

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
The common goal of all categorically funded programs 
in the San Bernardino City Unified School District (SBCUSD) is to 
ensure that all students
--
including English learners, educationally disadvantaged pupils, African American, Hispanic English 
only, gifted and talented pupils, and pupils with exceptional nee
ds
--
attain mastery of state and local standards.
 
 
The educational program at each site is based on an improvement planning process that includes members of the school 
community such as the principal, teachers, support staff, parents, and students (at the s
econdary level). These 
stakeholders form the School Site Council (SSC). The SSC develops and annually monitors, evaluates and revises a plan 
called the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA). The SPSA, based on self
-
study and collaboration, ensures tha
t all 
of the resources available to the school are coordinated and focused on providing a high
-
quality educational program in 
which all students can achieve success.
 
 
Some students have difficulty mastering academic state and local content standards. They 
may be at risk of not meeting 
graduation requirements. For these students, categorical program funds are provided. Categorical funds are supplemental 
educational dollars used for supports that augment the core instructional program and increase the academi
c success of 
these students. Categorical funds provide items such as additional personnel time, staff development opportunities, 
supplemental student materials, and other specialized services, equipment, and supplies.
 
 
Categorical programs commonly found a
t SBCUSD sites are:
 

 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Title I, Part A
 

 
Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF)
 
 
Additionally, categorical programs have been established at the district level to provide important services and 
instructional support that help inc
rease student success. Categorical funds in this category support District efforts in the 
areas of:
 

 
Vocational Education Basic Grant Award (Voc Ed) 

 
Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement 
Act of 2006
 

 
ESSA Title II, Part A 

 
Supporting 
Effective Instruction
 

 
ESSA Title III, Part A 

 
Language Instruction for English Learners (EL) and Language Instruction for Immigrant 
Students
 
 
Continuous Improvement
 
LEAs are encouraged to use evidence
-
based interventions that are reasonable, necessary, an
d consistent with Title I, Part 
A of the ESSA, to improve student achievement for those students not meeting grade level standards. At the local level, 
SBCUSD identifies schools with greatest needs, based on a variety of data, including local and state stu
dent progress 
indicators, to provide additional resources and services to the schools (referred to as Targeted Support for School Progress 
or TSSP). Additionally, the California Dashboard is used to identify schools and student groups in need of Comprehens
ive 
Support and Improvement (CSI), Targeted Support and Improvement (TSI), and Additional Targeted Support and 
Improvement (ATSI).
