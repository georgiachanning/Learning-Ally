By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Herbert Green Middle School is located in Placerville, Cal
ifornia, 32 miles east of Sacramento, in the beautiful foothills of 
the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. We serve fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grade students in the Mother Lode Union 
School District. We are dedicated to creating a learning environment th
at enables students to achieve their maximum 
potential in academic performance, critical thinking skills, expressive talents, physical development, social and emotional 
growth, and use of technology. Herbert Green provides a high quality educational experi
ence in conjunction with a 
collaborative learning partnership between parents, teacher and student. Our school community is involved and success 
oriented. Our educational programs are aligned with state and district standards and are designed to target spe
cific needs 
of our school population. We have early release days to incorporate staff development so that our teachers work 
collaboratively to increase effective teaching practices to then increase student learning. 
 
 
Climate for Learning
 
Students at Herb
ert Green Middle School are guided by specific rules and classroom expectations that promote respect, 
cooperation, courtesy and acceptance of others. Parents and students are informed of school rules and discipline policies 
via the website, mailers, e
-
mail
, school messenger phone system (Parent Link), and the Parent Handbook with the school's 
policies distributed at the beginning of the year. Parents are able to view student grades online via the Aeries SIS Portal. 
Herbert Green Middle School has instituted
 
a school
-
wide disciplinary program based on Positive Behaviors Interventions 
and Supports (PBIS). Positive behavior support is an application of a behaviorally
-
based systems approach to enhance the 
capacity of schools, families, and communities to design 
effective environments that improve the fit or link between 
research
-
validated practices and the environments in which teaching and learning occur. At Herbert Green we encourage 
our students to follow the Miner's Pride Expectations of Be Safe, Be Respectfu
l, and Be Responsible. At Herbert Green, all 
students receive Social Emotional Learning through their zero period "Connections." Here, students and teachers build 
positive relationships with one another and address topics that are components of building a 
positive school climate. At 
Herbert Green Middle School we have high expectations for student achievement. We are committed to providing 
students with a solid academic background in a safe and supportive environment. We challenge students through an 
academ
ic curriculum that requires them to apply skills and knowledge to meet the California State Standards (CCSS). Our 
intent is to build an academic foundation that will allow students to be successful in high school and beyond. The staff has 
fully implemented
 
programs that are aligned with the CCSS. Included in the programs are comprehensive assessments 
and an accountability component. The results of all assessments will be used to identify areas of need to refine instruction.
 
Herbert Green Middle School uses 
the following programs and practices to support our students with specific emphasis 
on our under

School Vision

their maximum potential in academic performance, critical thinking skills, expressive t
alents, physical development, social 
and emotional growth, and use of technology. We strive to maintain a safe, organized, enriched school climate where

to support and improve teaching and learning are based on current research and sound educational practice. Herbert

September 2018
 
 
Mother Lode Union Elementary held a public hearing on September 9th, 2015, and determined that each school within 
the district had sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equ
ipment pursuant to the 
settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual 
standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom a
nd to take home. 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are rev
iewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption. The table disp
lays information collected in September 2015 about the quality, currency, and availability of

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e.,

ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.
