By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all school
s are clean, safe, and functional.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the preventative measures and repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficie
nt service and that 
emergency repairs and safety are given the highest priority.   A specific maintenance worker is assigned to each site to 
help assure the school's needs are being met.
 
 
During the 2004
-
05 school year, local bond funds, Measure D, and 
state matching funds were used to modernize all schools 
with the exceptions of Austin Creek, which was constructed in 2000, and Village School. Village School's multi
-
use facility 
and playground area have been recently modernized, as well as recent replace
ment of carpeting, lighting, and various 
other updating.  All classrooms in the other five schools received new wall surfaces, paint, lighting, cabinetry, heating 
systems, upgraded electrical systems, window coverings, flooring, and marker boards. Each mul
ti
-
use facility was also 
completely modernized. State of the art library media centers and kindergarten complexes were built, and the 
administrative wing of each school was modernized to include small classrooms for special student programs, a staff room, 
office, and conference rooms.

During the summer of 2015, local bond funds, Measure F and local reserves were utilized for modernization of the 
Matanzas campus.  Included were upgraded HVAC systems, energy efficient windows, a remodeled office complex, and
 
play field improvements.  The RVCS
-
Matanzas campus received the new construction of several classrooms, including a 
shared music building.  In August 2017 the Madrone and Binkley campuses opened up a new building with 6 classrooms 
and a music room.  A new
 
play field, along with energy efficient windows and other improvements were made to the 
campuses.  In August of 2018 Village opened up with a major renovation to the classrooms, new classroom buildings, a 
new play field and play structure, and landscaping
 
improvements.  School security improvements have also been made at 
some of the schools, with the other schools to be completed in the next two years.  All schools have now received air 
conditioning as of August 2018.  All other schools will receive improv
ements through this bond program over the next 
couple of years.  The Governing Board has identified the following as key goals for the Measure F program. To ensure the 
schools offices are easily located but the public, to replace portable classrooms with m
odular and/or stick built permanent 
buildings, and to upgrade energy efficiency components such as HVAC, lighting, and window systems.
 
 
Cleaning standards have been adopted for all schools in the district. On a regular basis, the Maintenance and Operations
 
supervisor meets with the custodial staff and often visits sites to ensure the cleaning standards are being upheld. In 
addition, the principal communicates daily with the custodial staff to ensure a clean and safe school.  The district is 
proactive with m
aintenance needs and annually updates its deferred maintenance plan.   Work under this plan includes 
roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There are many opportunities for parent involvement at Austin Creek:
 
 
All parents of students attending Austin Creek are automatic members of our Parent Club.  The purpose of the Austin 
Creek Parent Club (ACPC) is to support the educational objectives of t
he school through fundraising, volunteerism and 
encouragement. ACPC assists the school in communicating information to all families.  Email blasts, and a comprehensive 
website keep the parents informed and encourage them to become actively involved at the 
school.  The Parent Club also 
provides opportunities for parents to coordinate special events such as the annual Walkathon, Author's Day, Fine Arts Day 
and Field Day.
 
 
In addition to the Parent Club, teachers utilize volunteers in the classroom to work wit
h small groups of students and help 
with special projects.  Parents can also become involved through chaperoning field trips and serving as room parents for 
the year.  Parents who would like to be involved in whole school planning and program development m
ay join our School 
Site Council. The School Site Council meets on a regular basis to communicate information, determine school needs, and 
develop a plan to address those needs.  In addition, parent forums and/or surveys are conducted on a regular basis to 
provide parents with the opportunity to provide feedback to the school. For more information, call Jenny Lynch at (707)

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety Plans are updated annually, and the last review was April 25th, 2019. The School Safety Plan is reviewed 
and updated annually. The key elements of the plan include, (1) the 
School Mission, (2) a description of the School Climate, 

-
EC3529.4 Board Policies. Each of these 
areas is spelled out in detail in the plans. The plans are comprehensive and 
include both the legal requirements and the 
benefits of safety planning.
 
 
School Discipline Practices
 
 
The staff and community of Austin Creek School work together to support the academic and social/emotional needs of 
the students at the school. We develop
 
school and classroom rules and procedures that support the four tenets of Safety, 
Respect, Responsibility and Kindness. These four tenets drive everything that we do. Students are recognized when they 
demonstrate a commitment to these four tenets and posi
tive behavior is acknowledged through a variety of methods. 
Information regarding the school rules and discipline procedures are outlined for students and their parents in the digital 
first day packet sent home at the start of the school year, reviewed at 
one of the parent club meetings, and shared in our 
weekly eblasts to the parent community.

Austin Creek and Rincon Valley has been focused on improving our math scores for students in grades 3
-
6 as measured 
by the SBAC, and improving English language acquisition for our English learner 
students as determined by our re
-
designation rates on the former CELDT and current ELPAC tests.
 
We use both district benchmark data and summative state
-
wide data to monitor our progress towards these goals.  For 
example, when reviewing on
-
going academic gr
owth for our English learners we use the RenLearn STAR Reader 
assessment 3 times per year to gauge student progress to make just in time instructional decisions to support students 
not meeting grade level expectations, and we analyze data from the ELPAC an
d the SBAC to review the effectiveness of 

math progress by reviewing Eureka Math end

-
module assessments, students in grades 1
-
6 also t
ake MobyMax 
placement tests two times per year, and students in grades 3
-
6 take the SBAC summative assessment 1 time per year.
 
Professional development opportunities are directly correlated to district goals and the LCAP. With a focus on High Quality 
Instr
uction (HQI), we provide teachers with three full
-
days of professional development trainings, 2
-
3 grade level planning 
days yearly, 8 monthly "District Wednesday" professional development sessions, and approximately 20 district
-
sponsored 
after school train
ings.   Teachers can also attend professional development opportunities through Sonoma County Office 

 
Teachers are supported in meeting our LCAP goals with coaching and mentoring through our Consulting Tea
cher Program, 
teacher
-
principal meetings, and grade level PLC teams.  The support is focused analyzing student assessment data to plan 
curriculum and make instructional choices which support teacher and student growth.
 
During the 2017
-
18 school year the di
strict administration and school site principals participated in professional 
development through the Center for Education Leadership (CEL).  A CEL trainer led several workshop sessions with the 
administration team where the focus was on the 5 Dimensions o
f Teaching and Leadership.  The administration team 
observed in classrooms as part of the training and collaborated together on what high quality instruction is and how to 
look for this in our classrooms.  For the 2018
-
19 school year we expanded this profe
ssional development to include two 
teachers from each school site, and in addition to this the administration team is continuing to receive further professional
 
development in the framework through CEL.
