By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Mission Statement
 
We are the professional educators of Judson & Brown Elementary School who provide a curriculum aligned to Common 
Core State Standards through rigorous and meaningful learning opportunities for our diverse student po
pulation so that 
they make progress toward college and career readiness and become life long learners.
 
 
School Description
 
Judson & Brown Elementary School opened in August 2006 and is a beautiful TK
-
 
grade 5 campus located in the northeast 
side of Redland
s. It is surrounded by orange groves and large home communities with panoramic views of the San 
Bernardino Mountains. Judson & Brown Elementary provides students with an excellent CCSS aligned curriculum that 
prepares them to succeed in college and in thei
r careers. Judson & Brown Elementary is named in honor of Redlands' 
founding fathers, Edward G. Judson and Frank E. Brown. Judson & Brown has received numerous awards recognizing the 
outstanding education that is provided to all of our students. We have re
ceived the Title I Academic Achievement Award 
in 2011, 2012 and in 2016; The California Business for Education Honor Roll Award in 2011, 2012, 2015 and in 2016. in 
2014 we received the same honor along with a STEM distinction due to our high math and scien
ce scores. Judson & Brown 
was also the recipient of The National Blue Ribbon Schools Award in 2012. We most recently were honored to receive the 
California Gold Ribbon Award in 2016. Judson & Brown Elementary is leading the district in ProWise implementati
on and 
offers students the opportunity to expand their STEM experiences in their TINKERSPACE in the library/media center.
 
 
Approximately less than 5% of the student population is identified as limited English proficient and approximately 51% 
participate in
 
the Free/Reduced Lunch Program. One RUSD Special Day Class (SDC) and one SDC classes operated by the 
San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools are housed at Judson & Brown. The students in the Judson & Brown 
SDC class have mild to moderate learning 
disabilities while the County classes are moderate to severe. In addition, 
California Childrens Services operates the San Bernardino County Medical Therapy Unit (MTU) adjacent to our campus. 
The MTU provides adaptive physical therapy to students with speci
al needs as well as having a medical clinic services 
available on site.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Judson & Brown Elementary School opened in August 2006; As a newer facility it is exemplary in design and maintenance. 
A new 
school building was constructed and  occupied beginning August 2008.
 
Care and diligence of maintaining the "newness" of J&B is evident in every monthly site report for the current school year 
with the highest scores on maintenance for an elementary campus 
in RUSD.  Staff, custodial, families and students 
participate semi
-
annually in an entire campus clean up. The governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools 
in RUSD. A summary of these standards is available at the school office, at the Dis
trict Office, or at 
www.redlands.k12.ca.us. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean 
and safe school.

opportunities for parents to become involved with school activities. The most important parent 
involvement is ensuring that learning also takes place at home.  This includes making reading with your child a priority, 
supervising daily homework, and helping
 
facilitate frequent school
-
 
home communication.  Other ways to become 
involved as a parent is to become a member of the PTA or to participate in PTA activities, ELAC (English Language Advisory 
Committee) meetings, School Site Council and other school prog
rams/events, including, but not limited to:  Family Fun

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
The Judson & Brown Elementary Safety Plan is updated annually. SSC prepared the safety plan most recently in October 
2019.  It includes disaster response teams, classroom maps, evacuation routes, and a log of monthly drills. Procedures for 
fire,
 
earthquakes, and lock down situations are all addressed verbally, in written form and by modeling the procedures 
schoolwide. Each classroom is equipped with disaster preparedness packs, and each child has been allocated water and 
snack food in the event o
f an emergency. Each classroom has posted Lock
-
Down procedures as well as emergency 
evacuation routes. A Staff Classroom notebook in each teacher area of the classroom contains detailed information for 
disaster situations. Substitute folders also include i
nformation for emergency procedures. Fire drills, lockdown drills and 
other emergency preparation drills are held monthly with the schedule available in the office and in the Staff Classroom 
notebook. Drills are subject to change without notice in order to
 
facilitate a "real world" event. The Leadership Team 
reviews the plan in September and shares the revised plan with their grade level team in order to be prepared for the 
October California Shake

Judson & Brown Elementary utilizes a grade level team meeting/whole staff meeting model to plan and implement 
professional development. Based upon relevant student performance data, teachers identify areas of need to 
focus. 
Identified as a focus for the years 2016
-
2017, 17
-
18 and 18
-
19 include the continual use of data analysis using Illuminate 
to disseminate information from District Common Benchmarks, IAB's,  effective instruction for English Learners, strategies 
and
 
understanding of the teaching of Math In Focus and the continual professional development of technology as well as 
the common language of the Peace Builders Character Education tenets. Student achievement data as well as information 
from walk
-
throughs and
 
conversations with the Leadership Team is reviewed to determine the specific areas of need for 
professional development planning. Teachers have also been supported with professional development offered through 
the district office in the math, CORE reading
 
academy, writing instruction through LEVERAGE, NGSS (Science), Technology 
and innovation as well as data reports and interpretation, ELD strategies, ELLEVATION and social/emotional strategies for 
classrooms. Teachers receive professional development after
 
school during 8 minimum days provided for this purpose 
each year. These days are also used for the focus as noted above as well as for specific topics that are provided by the 
district office elementary ed. services department. These topics have included:
 
rigor in instruction, purposeful planning, 
collaborative teaching as well as using technology as instructional tools. Teachers have supported with a credentialed 
math intervention teacher who works daily with students in small groups or individually as de
termined by data analysis 
from multiple sources such as STAR Math data, benchmarks, curriculum testing and SBAC results. The math intervention 
teacher supports teachers during implementation of curriculum  through the understanding of standards and in the 
areas 
of technology based assessment as well as with instructional strategies. Teachers utilize the math intervention teacher 
through one on one after school meetings and by using performance based data reporting to determine the need for the 
intervention 
services.  Technology use as an instructional resource is an area of concentration for staff and is a supported 
area of development during the school day, after school, full day professional development and through outside 
presenters and conferences such a
s CUE and ISTE. As is requested or necessary teachers are given the time during the 
day, after school or as they need to collaborate with other teachers, other schools, conferences, webinars and planning 
in order to strengthen and develop their skills and 
become technology ninjas!
