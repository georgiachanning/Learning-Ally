School Description
 
Welcome to D.D. Johnston Elementary School, where we focus on Building Great Character One 
Pillar At A Time. Currently we have just completed the second year of state testing using the new 
Smarter Balanced Assessment on the California Common Core Standards
. The state of California 
has yet to release guidance in expected growth and status expectations.   Our academic program is 
called ExCEL, which stands for Excellence: A Commitment to Every Learner.  Students are assessed 
on a consistent basis and parents a
re provided progress reports on a regular basis.  Students in 
Kindergarten through 5th grade take a diagnostic assessment at least twice a year (Kindergarten) 
and three times (1st through 5th grade).
 
 
D.D. Johnston Elementary supports our districtwide lite
racy initiative and teachers collaborate to 
provide our students the best instruction possible. Our School Site Council (SSC) provides resources 
to support this initiative. We also provide students the opportunity to many online resources at no 
cost to our
 
families. Students have free access to an online academic support computer program 
(iREADY) in ELA and Math both at school and at home. Students are awarded points and can earn 
an award each month for attaining the most points.
 
 
Our school's motto is Buil
ding Great Character One Pillar At A Time. We enrich our students with 
education in the Six Pillar of Character, which include Trustworthiness, Respect, Responsibility, 
Caring, Fairness, and Citizenship.  Each month, we focus on a pillar and discuss it in 
assemblies, 
classrooms, and Student of the Month awards.  In addition, we are a Playworks school.  We have a 
full
-
time coach that teaches all of our students the Power of Play.
 
 
Here at Johnston, our community is very important to us. We keep our parents i
nformed of their 
child's progress through our schoolwide report cards. We include important information on our 
website and send flyers and calendars/events through our Thursday Folders. Every Friday, parents 
are welcomed to have lunch with their child duri
ng their regular lunch period.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information 
about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports 
for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are 
publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet 
at

the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Invo
lvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We have many ways for parents to participate in the life of our school, and we depend on parents to keep our programs running
 
smoothly. Parents can 
join our School Site Council, which works with administration to help make fin
ancial decisions. Parents of English learners are vital to our ELAC and to 
our outreach efforts. Parent volunteers help with special projects in the classroom and chaperone on field trips. The PTA spo
nsors annual fund
-
raisers 
and has raised funds to purcha
se two playground structures and playground benches and tables. We invite all parents to attend Back
-
to
-
School Night in 
the fall, Open House in the spring, and parent
-
teacher conferences in November and March. Our school uses School Messenger communication
 
system 
to notify families of important school events. We always need new volunteers!
 
 
 
 
In addition, we are always looking for ways to enhance our parental involvement program. Annually, our parents are provided a
 
survey where they can 
inform us on specif
ic areas. This information is important to us and we take great pride in our results.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
O
ther local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Staff monitors the school grounds for 15 minutes before and after school as well as at all recesses and at lunchtime. Teacher
s regularly review the rules 
for safe, responsible behavior in scho
ol and on the playground. A schoolwide assembly to review school rules and conduct is presented twice a year 
(September and January). Visitors must enter the school through the main gate after being buzzed in for clearance and sign in
 
at the office, where 
they 
receive a visitor's badge to wear throughout their stay.
 
 
We revise our School Safety Plan annually.. The plan includes procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and inventories of eme
rgency supplies. We make 
the plan available on our school Web site and keep copies in the office for parents. We share the plan wit
h all staff during a schoolwide staff meeting. 
We conduct monthly schoolwide and districtwide drills three times a year. In addition we hold an annual training for staff on
 
emergency preparedness.  
In addition, the school has a safety committee that is com
prised of staff and parents in order to update the plan.
