School Description
 
In September of 1973, Fairlands Elementary school opened with the chosen mascot, the Flyers, 
rooted in local history: the surrounding land, with its scenic hills, had long been a popular choice 
for hot air balloonists. Flash forward fort
y
-
five years to a bustling suburb with the school 
surrounded by Stanford Valley Care Hospital, Hacienda Business Park, the 580 freeway, and a 
myriad of single family homes, apartments, and newly built condominiums. Although much has 
changed, our priority a
t Fairlands remains the same: to serve and grow our students.  Fairlands 
serves students in transitional kindergarten through fifth grade and follows a traditional school 
calendar. The student population at Fairlands has remained in the high seven hundreds
 
over the 
last eight school years, while the English Learner population has almost tripled since 2012
-
2013: 
from 10.7% to 28.6% in 2019
-
20. In the fall of 2019, 42% of the students entering Kindergarten 
were English Learners.   The majority of our student 
body is of Asian decent representing a variety 
of cultures and countries throughout India and Asia. The number of students qualifying for free and 
reduced meals has stayed constant over five years and represents approximately 6% of the total 
population. In
 
addition, 6.75% of students qualify for special education services.
 
 
Student emotional and academic success is the utmost priority for our fifty
-
six member staff. Our 

unity of 

Pleasanton emphasizing the six character traits of responsibility, compassion, self
-
discipline, 
honesty, respect, and integrity. To expand our PBIS
 
framework in order to create Multi
-
Tiered 
Systems of Support (MTSS) we have implemented Response to Intervention and instruction (RTI2). 
Consistent blocks of time for intervention and instruction are strategically scheduled by grade level. 
Instruction dur
ing this timeframe is designed using student data analysis, teacher collaboration, 
and curriculum planning.
 
 
The commitment of our community to work together to support and enhance the learning 
experience of all students is evident in many ways. Our Parent
 
Teacher Association works closely 
with the school to provide numerous family events and curriculum enrichment. Parent volunteers 
within the classroom are a constant. We offer parent education classes, including our School Smarts 
Parent Academy. Together w
e work to promote a positive and inclusive community honoring the 
diverse cultures and family heritages at Fairlands.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
Fairlands provides a positive, safe, and rigorous learning environment.  We encourage independent 
problem
-
solving and s
chool to home collaboration while fostering the whole child's academic, 
social, and emotional development.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, 
Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Instructional Materials
 
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Fairlands Elementary School are currently being aligned to the California State 
Standards.  Instruct
ional 
materials are selected from the state's most recent list of standards
-
based materials and adopted by the State Board of Education. The district follows 
the State Board of Education's six
-
year adoption cycle for core content materials (English/languag
e arts, math, science, and social science).
 
 
On Tuesday, September 24, 2019, the Pleasanton Unified School District's Board of Trustees held a public hearing to certify t
he extent to which textbooks 
and instructional materials have been provided to student
s. The Board of Trustees adopted Resolution 2019
-
2020.004 which certifies as required by 
Education Code§60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional materials were provided to all students, including English learners
, in the district to the extent 
that each 
pupil has a textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient textbooks and 
instructional materials 
were provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standar
ds and consistent with the cycles and content 
of the curriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English/language arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materia
ls used for their visual/performing 
arts curricula.  During the 2019
-
20 school year, Pleasanton Unified School District provided ea
ch student, including English learners, enrolled in a 
visual/performing arts class with a textbook or instructional materials to use in class and to take home. These materials com
plied with the state's content 
standards and curriculum frameworks.

School Facility Conditions and Plan
ned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
School Facilities & Maintenance
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional through proper facilities mainten
ance and campus supervision. 
Fairlands Elementary School's ori
ginal facilities were built in 1973; ongoing maintenance and campus improvements ensure facilities remain up to date 
and provide adequate space for students and staff. District maintenance and site custodial staff ensure that the repairs nece
ssary to keep 
the school in 
good condition are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used by school and district staff to communicate non
-
routine maintenance 
requests. Every morning before school begins, the custodian inspects facilities for safety hazar
ds or other conditions that need attention prior to students 
and staff entering school grounds. One day custodian and two evening custodians (one full
-
time and one part
-
time) are assigned to Fairlands Elementary 
School. The day
 
custodian is responsible for
:
 

 
Classroom cleaning
 

 
Cafeteria setup/cleanup
 

 
Groundskeeping
 

 
Office area cleaning
 

 
Restroom cleaning

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

Fairlands we work closely with parents to make educational decisions that 
benefit students and promote a child's growth socially, emotionally, and cognitively.
 
 
The school utilizes several forms of communication to keep parents informed about their child's
 
academic progress and school events, including:
