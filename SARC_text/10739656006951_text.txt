About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abo
ut the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal
 
or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Avail
ability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Central Unified Schools maintain current and standards
-
aligned instructional materials in good repair, for all students. Materials are locally adopted and 
reflect programs currently app
roved by the State Board of Education. All materials currently adopted reflect the most recent SBE adoptions and support 
the current California Frameworks.
 
 
Every student, including English Learners, Special Education, and other special populations have th
eir own textbook. In the case of class sets, those sets 
augment individual texts that have been issued to individual students. These class sets are made based on a commitment of the
 
district administration 
and the governing board and are not the product of
 
any state requirement.
 
 
All instructional materials are subject to a school and district review process. Materials may be piloted and all materials t
hat are selected and 
recommended for local adoption are reviewed by teachers, 
administration, and any parents who wish to review the materials. The Central Unified Board 
of Trustees reviews and adopt based on the recommendation of the district adoption committees and Educational Services.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Roosevelt sits on 11.3 acres and 45,279 
square feet. It contains 32 classrooms at 31,036 sq ft, and 13 restrooms at 2,134 sq ft. The oldest main building 
was built in 1955. Two classroom wings were completely renovated in 2018 with an update to the administrative office in 2019.
 
The table below 
shows 
the results of the school's most recent inspection using the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT).  This inspection determines the 
school facility's good repair 
status. District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep the school in good re
pair and work orders are completed in a timely manner.  
For all items inspected that were found to not be in 'good repair', work orders have been created and maintenance will be don
e before the end of the 
2019
-
20 school year.  Maintenance items will be pri
oritized so that student safety is not compromised.  The overall rating for this school is 'fair'.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the S
tate priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education populat
ion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
alig
ned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that 
satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

T
he SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;

School Safety Plan
 
The Site Emergency Response Pl
an was reviewed, updated, and discussed with faculty in September, October, and December of 2019, at staff meetings 
and/or separate meetings for classified staff.  This annual review of our Site Emergency Response Plan allows us to strongly 
consider the ov
erall aspects 
of our school site while focusing on the key elements of our plan. School Site Council approved the plan on October 30, 2019.
 
The key elements of our 
plan include the properties of the physical features and nature of our entire school site, t
he daily routines and practices the adults commit to and adhere 
to, as well as the consistent procedures and protocols we take with our students in the event of man
-
made and/or natural safety hazards.  This annual 
review and update allowed us to identify a
nd make decisions about our specific school needs to help ensure we have instituted the effective safety 
measures needed to safeguard our school community, as well as meet our safety compliance standards.  Drills are conducted on 
a regular basis in 
complia
nce with district/state guidelines. Two
-
way radios and surveillance cameras are provided to all our staff this year.

as well as skill

based instruction tied to standards within
 
the guided reading structure. Additionally, data collected by teachers on reading fluency and 
comprehension (at least 3 but up to 10 times per year for Tier 2 and 3 students) provides guidance for teachers when planning
 
their intervention and 
supports wit
hin their PLCs. 
 
 
Roosevelt will support our teachers with professional development in the following areas:
 

 
Provide instructional coach support and expertise, identifying best instructional practices and effective differentiated inst

vide clarity to students 
and data to guide our instructional planning and support, as well as reading comprehension strategies, math conceptual develo
pment, and social

pproximately 20 
professional development days (1 to 2 hours each) on the calenda

best student results is provided once a year. Progress reports are sent to the administration on a weekly basis.
 

 
Accelerated Reader (AR), The AR program targets the improvement and the consistent monitoring of every students' reading com
prehension.

improvement with reading comprehension. Students are able to take these AR quizzes in our computer 
lab and/or on the student laptops in the 
classrooms. Teaching faculty receives a minimum of annual training on the most effective use of and monitoring practices of A
