By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Village Elementary School creates a student
-
centered learning environment that serves the whole child in grades ranging 
from preschool through 5th Grade. We enable students to prepare for their future by developing
 
the skills, knowledge, 
and confidence necessary to seek a meaningful life, both individually and as a productive member of the community.
 
 
Our mission statement:  Through rigorous academic standards, high expectations, and a comprehensive and coordinated 
curriculum (including Visual and Performing Arts and experiences in our new Innovation Lab), Village Elementary, in 
partnership with our district and community, will graduate students with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in 
higher education, ca
reers, society, and life with empowered confidence to fulfill their dreams and aspirations for the 
future.
 
 
Located in the heart of the village of Coronado, a small island resort community on the coast of San Diego, California, 
Coronado Village Elementary,
 
a past California Distinguished School and a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence, 
serves as the hub of this small city. Our beautiful brick building is one of three schools located within one square mile of 
the Coronado Unified School District. We s
hare this block with the middle school and high school. Our partner elementary 
school, Silver Strand, is located three miles south and serves families living in Naval Enlisted Housing and a neighboring 
resort area.
 
 
The Village Elementary main campus opene
d in 1992, and encompasses two campuses: the main campus at 600 6th Street 
which serves grades 1
-
5, and the Early Childhood Development Center (ECDC), which houses Crown Preschool, a fee
-
based 
preschool serving three and four year old students in general a
nd special education, and Village Transitional Kindergarten 
and Kindergarten students. Between the two campuses, approx.850 students from pre
-
school to grade five are active, 
engaged learners becoming prepared for college and career.
 
 
The community include
s low, middle, and upper income homes, apartment buildings, small businesses, and hotels. 
Approximately 40% of our families are military, serving on our local naval bases, ships, and submarines,  making our school 
population highly mobile. Seven different 
ethnic groups and languages are represented at Village. The staff is committed 
to providing the best education possible for every student, by name, by need. All decisions are made based on what is in 
the best interest of our students. We believe in modelin
g life
-
long learning and are continuously attending professional 
development opportunities to improve our curriculum, instruction, and assessment practices.

Village Elementary teachers meet regularly to collaborate and learn about best 
instructional practices focused on the 
needs of students and reflect on current student formative data to plan instruction. In addition to providing a rigorous 
curriculum based on high standards, the Village staff works in partnership with our families and
 
community members to 
teach life skills through a district
-
wide program, Sanford Harmony, so students learn what it means to be a positive, 
respectful, and responsible citizen.  The Military Family Life Counselor (MFLC) and the Clinical Counselor teach cla
ssroom 
lessons, provide group and individual counseling, and other levels of social
-
emotional supportive programs to ensure all 
students are achieving and succeeding. Everyone
-
A
-
Reader (EAR) volunteers provide one to one support in reading to 
students on a
 
daily basis, and our learning labs provide additional support in reading, writing and math daily.  In 
partnership with our MFLC, we host Anchored for Life for students to provide extra support to new military families. The 
Village team of dedicated profes
sionals are committed to striving for excellence for all our students, for our programs, 
and for our learning environment. Our inclusive learning environments provide equity for all students, regardless of degree 
of learning or physical challenges. Student
s are included in the general education classrooms, with small group or 
individual assistance as needed. The Student Success Team (SST) program is offered for students who need assistance 
academically, socially, emotionally, or cognitively as the foundatio
n of our Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) 
framework. We actively use Restorative Practices to engage our learners in restoring relationships as a form of social and 
emotional reintegration and relationship management. Teachers and students use a vari
ety of technology applications to 
extend thinking and to provide a challenging curriculum. The Village Innovation (iLab), library, and netbook computers 
available for each grade level, support project
-
based learning and a growing one
-
to
-
one program, grades
 
K
-
5. Each 
classroom houses a multimedia computer workstation including an LCD projector/document camera, and many 
classrooms have Smart Boards.
 
 
Choir, Band, World Languages (French and Spanish), Robotics, Soccer and many other enrichment 
opportunities are in 
place both before and after the instructional day to provide a wide variety of extracurricular experiences for all students 
on the Village campus.  We partner with many businesses and organizations in the community throughout the schoo
l year 
to promote learning opportunities for students and provide volunteer opportunities for community members.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Current financial hardship makes planning and completing facility improvements difficult. We are fortunate enough to 
have 
already updated our facilities and hopefully we will be able to maintain what we currently have. Additional staff 
would help to provide longevity to what will begin to degrade more rapidly.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achiev
ement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Altern
ate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievemen
t standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
t
he University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Village 
Elementary, it is truly evident that parents are not only welcomed, but also embraced as co
-
educators and seen 

schools improve when teach

education.
 
 
The School Site Council (SSC) is made up of parents and teachers who together suggest how our funds will be spent along 
with other important school decision
s. The very name of our parent group, Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), 
demonstrates our joint commitment, as well. We have a large number of community volunteers each week at Village and 
have been recognized for our exemplary implementation of Everyone A
 
Reader (EAR) program.
 
 
Our school facilities are often available for use by community organizations, businesses, and they in turn, provide 

improvements to 
our school. We maintain a strong partnership with the US Navy; personnel from various commands from Naval Base 
Coronado volunteer their time in a variety of ways including after school Anchored for Life programming. Village 
Elementary honor
s our local military veterans each year on Veterans Day. These partnerships we have created are 
essential in weaving home, school, and community together. Visitors to Coronado Village Elementary always comment on 
what a special school it is. We know our st
udents, staff, and parents make it a school worthy of state and national 
recognition.
 
 
Our parents are an integral part of our site strategic plan and are partners in completing our Local Control Accountability 
Plan (LCAP) each year in February. Several pa
rents meet yearly to review and update our plan which drives our focus and 
instruction throughout the year. We are proud to say that parents are truly an essential part of the educational process at 
Village.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Site Council reviews and approves a comprehensive safe school plan including data regarding school crime, 
safe school procedures, and compliance with laws including:
 
 
(1) child abuse reporting, (2) disaster response, (3) suspension and expulsion
 
policies, (4) notification of teachers of 
dangerous pupils, (5) sexual harassment, (6) school wide dress codes prohibiting gang
-
related apparel, (7) procedures for 
safe ingress and egress from school, (8) procedures to ensure a safe and orderly environmen
t conducive to learning, and 
(9) rules and procedures on school discipline adopted pursuant to Ed Code Sections 35291 and 35291.5. A copy of the plan 
is available for inspection by the public at each school. It is revisited and updated annually each Septem
ber, followed by 
Governing Board approval. We conduct practice emergency drills including fire, earthquake, and lock down each month 
during the school year.  Each classroom is equipped with an emergency backpack, bottled water, and a snack for each 
student
 
in case of a real emergency.  Staff is prepared to perform as necessary in the event of a real disaster/emergency.
 
 
For safety purposes, all visitors and volunteers are required to sign in at the office upon arrival, wear a visitor/volunteer
 
lanyard, and 
sign out when leaving. Any time parents wish to confer with the teacher, the classroom teacher should be 
contacted for an appointment. Any time parents wish to observe in the classroom, permission from the principal or 
principal designee would need to be o
btained 48 hours prior to the visit and limited to 30 minutes in duration, per school 
board policy.  Other than before and after school, both the Village Main Campus and the ECDC campus are closed 
campuses.
