School Description
 
Grimmer 
Elementary School is a high
-
performing California Distinguished School as well as a 
California Gold Ribbon School and a California Title I Academic Achievement Award recipient. We 
have been recognized by Innovate Public Schools as a Top Bay Area Public Sch
ool for Underserved 
Students for mathematics and language arts in 2016, 2017, 2018, & 2019.
 
 
In addition to our English program, Grimmer School also has a Two
-
Way Spanish Dual
-
Immersion 
program and a Moderate Special Day Program where all children can be 
successful. Families from 
many neighborhoods in Fremont choose Grimmer School for its wonderful diversity and many 
specialized programs. Our Two
-
Way Spanish Dual Immersion Program prepares children to become 
bilingual and bi
-
literate. Our Moderate Special 
Day Program provides inclusion opportunities which 
enhance the learning experiences of all of our students. Whether students participate in one of 
these programs or the English
-
only course of study, they receive much academic support, 
challenge, and interv
ention during the school day and after school.
 
 
We are committed to ensuring the success of all students. Our academic growth trend has largely 
resulted from an outstanding instructional program, in which our highly trained teachers use the 
best research
-
b
ased teaching methods. Our Professional Learning Communities allow teachers and 
staff meaningful collaboration time in planning for the educational needs of each individual 
student.
 
 
Grimmer has a unique and innovative approach to Anti
-
Bullying, which allo
ws students to 
understand the meaning of bullying, and gives them support and solutions to avoid bullying. 
Grimmer also has an organized Student Council and Super Bear Club. These student groups arrange 
activities on campus for promoting kindness including
 
monthly kindness challenges for all students.  
Adults and students are fully committed to the success of these programs which provide social and 
emotional support for students, parents, and Grimmer staff in these efforts.  Students and parents 
also enjoy 
the arts at Grimmer. Our Arts Block program is a seven
-
week visual and performing arts 
elective held in late spring with a focus on rigorous art
-
based writing projects. Students participate 
in the Fremont Education Foundation sponsored after
-
school band pr
ogram that meets once a 
week.
 
 
In our Family Literacy Program, parents learn strategies to work effectively with their children at 
home to promote academic achievement. Childcare is provided while parents are in class. We host 
Family Literacy and Family Ni
ghts to help parents learn special techniques to use at home.  Each 
year we are proud to provide Parent/Family Nights at Grimmer where parents learn more about 
supporting their students academic success on the pathway to college and career readiness. 
Paren

we work to build relationships and strengthen communication within the Grimmer community.
 
 
At Grimmer School, we strive to meet the academic, social, physical, and
 
emotional needs of each 
child. We do this within a warm, safe, and child
-
centered environment. We believe that learning 
should be transferable to real
-
life situations and should involve communication and interaction 
among students, parents, school, and th
e community. Staff members are dedicated, nurturing, and 
supportive of students and their families and work hard to improve student achievement and the 
school.

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core cla
sses for all students. The 
la
w also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Grimmer School opened for students in 1957. The campus is always well kept, 
clean, and free of litter, thanks to the hard work of our custodians, teachers, 
students, and parents. Past collaboration between district classified managers and business partners resulted in beautificati
on of the Grimmer campus. 
The campus remains a sour
ce of pride within the community.
 
 
Grimmer Elementary consists of three main building wings, a cluster of three portable classrooms, a library, a computer lab, 
and a parent literacy 
classroom. The main wings house the office complex, 25 classrooms, a staff
 
room, and a preschool portable. Grimmer also has a multi
-
use 

s Department makes all 
needed repairs and performs scheduled maintena
nce. The Facilities Department provides needed improvements.
 
 


2005 school year and 
Measure E Bond funds during the 2017
-
2018 school year
.  We have worked with our district consultants on a Long Range Facilities plan.
 
 
All staff and student restrooms were made fully accessible. The roof was replaced, structural support beams were installed, a
nd the fire alarm and 
electrical systems were upg
raded. All classrooms and the cafeteria now have air conditioning. Seismic retrofitting of the original school buildings was 
completed. Our school was painted during the fall of 2005. Recent improvements include new turf and irrigation on the primary
 
and i
ntermediate fields 
and a drop
-
off/pick
-
up parking lot renovation in the front of the school. In September 2012 we opened our newly constructed science lab which is 
used 
for our Science program providing hands
-
on science experiments and projects to all stud
ents. With donations received from our PTA, in the Spring of 
2017 we were able to install a new digital marquee in the front of the school. During the summer of 2017, the entire campus u
nderwent construction to 
install IT upgrades. During the summer of 201
8, construction to several areas of the school began to improve drainage and replace HVAC units in all 
classrooms. In November of 2018, new exterior doors were installed with panic bars and a new security fence completed on the 
NE side of campus as 
well as
 
updating the parking lot for handicap accessibility.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Of
fice of Public School Construction.  Based on the survey noted above, we have answered the questions you see 
below. Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report. Since that time
, those conditions may
 
have 
changed.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System
, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and gr
ade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive
 
disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of
 
study

taking the total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students 
who met the standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental 
Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We have many opportunities for parents to part
icipate in our school, and we depend on parents to keep our programs running smoothly. Parents can 
join and/or attend regular meetings of the School Site Council (SSC), which works with the administration to help make financ
ial decisions. Parents of 
Englis
h Learners are vital to our English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), District English Language Advisory Committee (DELAC),
 
and to our outreach 
efforts on behalf of new families.
 
 
Teachers organize volunteers to help with special projects in their classr
ooms and chaperone on field trips. We invite parents to assist in the school 
library. The PTA sponsors many campus activities which in the past have included Our Turkey Trot, In
-
Tents Reading Night, beautification days when 
parents assist with projects aro
und the grounds with their children, and various fund raising activities.
 
 
We ask all parents to attend Back
-
to
-
School Night in the fall, and Family Nights throughout the year, and extend an invitation for parent
-
teacher 
conferences as necessary. Bi
-
monthl
y Coffee with the Principal events allow an informal setting for parents to get answers to questions that may arise 
as well as learn about new programs or initiatives happening at the school or in the district.
 
 
Our Annual Family Nights provide an opportun
ity to learn how they can support their children in their education and give them tools to monitor academic 
progress throughout the year with the help of teachers.  New this last year is our Parent Cafe's.  Parents work through guide
d activities to get to 
know 
one another, hear how other parents work through daily situations that arise, and building a closer community as a result.
 
 
Parents are also invited to devote time to helping the classroom teacher, supervising students on the playground, and partici
pa
ting in a host of other 
activities. New volunteers are greatly appreciated!  Please contact our office at (510) 656

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Staff and parent volunteers monitor the school grounds for 10 minutes before and 20 minutes after school as well as at all 
recesses and at lunchtime. 
Parent volunteers and teachers monitor students before, during, and after school to be sure children and families are safe. T
eachers review the rules for 
safe, responsible behavior in school and on the playground the first week o
f the school year. The principal holds assemblies regularly around expected 
behavior, bullying, and sexual harassment.
 
 
Grimmer is a closed campus. Visitors to the school must report to the office, sign in, and receive a visitor sticker to wear 
throughout 
their stay. All students 
received formal conflict resolution training the week of September 16, 2019, students monitor our playgrounds during recesses
 
along with our teachers 
and adult noon duty supervisors.
 
 
We continue to work with the City of Fremont an
d Safe Routes to School to encourage walking or riding bikes to school safely and addressing any traffic 
concerns that parents may have with a goal of improving health and safety at Grimmer. We have a wonderful volunteer crossing 
guard who keeps 
students s
afe at drop off in the morning and pick up in the evening.
 
 
In addition to regular parent meetings regarding safety, we revise our School Safety Plan annually. The plan includes procedu
res for emergencies, and 
exit routes. Parent volunteers from our PTA an
d school safety committee regularly take inventories and are continually working with our district staff to 
update emergency supplies as well as to stock our emergency shed with items necessary for long term shelter
-
in
-
place requirements.  We have an Eagle
 
Scout volunteer who is working to further organize our storage shed to make supplies more accessible during an emergency.
 
 
We make the plan available for parents in the school office. We shared the 2019
-
20 safety plan during our August, 2019 staff develop
ment meeting. 
Routines are practiced between November and March. We hold regular safety drills including, fire drills, lockdown drills, and
 
earthquake drills, and hold 
training for staff on emergency preparedness throughout the school year. Grimmer partici
pated in the Great California ShakeOut on October 18, 2019.

Professional Development provided fo
r Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. 
 
Below is the amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional deve
lopment:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
2017
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations these days are sometimes reduced.
