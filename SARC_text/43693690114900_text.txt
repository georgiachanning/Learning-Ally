School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report
 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountabilit
y Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF o
r LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
p
rincipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

At Russo/McEntee Academy we are committed to providing students with an educa
tional experience that is positive, 
successful, and encourages life

academic excellence through scientific inquiry and discovery.
 
 
The staff at Russo/McEntee 
Academy is focused on making the Common Core State Standards and Next Generation 
Science Standards accessible for every  child. Russo/McEntee staff is focused on getting parents and guardians actively 
involved in the school and classrooms. Families are inv

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summati
ve Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partic
ipate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of student
s who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

calculated by taking the total number of 
students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who 
met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3
-
Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total numbe
r of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student
 
privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. T
he achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Russo/McEntee Academy has a very 
detailed, comprehensive school safety plan that outlines protocols, systems, and 
procedures in the event of any/all emergencies. The plan is in effect until 2020. It contains the yearly safety goals as 
determined by the students, staff, and parents. The Ru
sso/McEntee Safety Committee develops the safety plan before it 
is presented to the Alum Rock Union Elementary School District Board of Trustees for annual approval.
 
 
The safety plan and drill procedures are reviewed during the year with all staff. Safety 
alerts are shared with all staff as 
needed throughout the school year. In addition, all required drills are calendared, completed, and shared with the staff. 
This year we collected all the necessary equipment and supplies to prepare ourselves for a major e
arthquake.
