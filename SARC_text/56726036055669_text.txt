Assessments (SBAC) for students in the 
general education population, and the 
California Alternate Assessments (CAAs) for 
students with the most significant cognitive 
disabilities.  Only eligible students may 
participate in the administration of the CAAs.  
CAAs items are aligned with alternative 
achievement standards, which are linked 
with the Common Core State Standards 
(CCSS).  CAASPP results are a measure of 
how well students are mastering California™s 
standards in English language arts/literacy 
(ELA) and mathematics, and are given to 
grades three through eight and grade eleven. 
SBAC tests assess student performance in 
ELA/Literacy and mathematics utilizing

all schools are clean, safe, and functional 
through proper facilities maintenance and 
campus supervision. Big Springs Elementary™s 
original facilities were built in 1964; ongoing

ensure facilities remain up to date and 
provide adequate space for students and 
staff. District maintenance and site custodial 
staff ensure that the repairs necessary to keep 
the school in good condition are completed 
in a timely manner. The District Governing 
Board has adopted cleaning standards for all 
schools in the District.  A summary of these 
standards is available at the school office, at 
the District Office, or on the Internet at www.
simivalleyusd.org.
A work order process is used by school and 
district staff to communicate non-routine 
maintenance requests. Emergency repairs 
are given the highest priority.

VISION
 & 
SAFETY
School administration and teaching staff 
place a high priority on providing adequate 
adult supervision on campus before, during, 
and after school. As students arrive on 
campus each morning, campus supervisors, 
school administration, and teaching staff are 
strategically assigned to designated entrance 
areas and the playground.  During recess 
and lunch, campus supervisors monitor 
playground activity.  At the end of the day 
when students are dismissed, campus 
supervisors, school administration, and 
teaching staff monitor student behavior to 
ensure a safe and orderly departure. 
Big Springs Elementary is a closed campus. 
During school hours, all visitors must sign in 
at the school™s office and wear identification 
badges while on school grounds.

The Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan 
was developed for Big Springs Elementary 
in collaboration with local agencies and 
the district office to fulfill Senate Bill 187 
requirements. Components of this plan 
include child abuse reporting procedures, 
teacher notification of dangerous pupil 
procedures, disaster response procedures, 
procedures for safe arrival and departure 
from school, sexual harassment policy, and 
dress code policy. The school™s most recent 
school safety plan was reviewed, updated, 
and discussed with school staff in October 
2019.SCHOOL

On an annual basis, schools are required 
by the state to perform a comprehensive 
inspection and report those findings to 
the school community. The most recent 
inspection for Big Springs Elementary 
School took place on November 5, 2019. 
The School Facility Good Repair Status table 
illustrated in this report identifies the state-
required inspection areas and discloses the 
operational status in each of those areas.
