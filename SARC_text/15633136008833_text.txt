About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Av
ailability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Arvin Union School District held a Public Hearing on September 10, 2019 and determined that each school within the district h
ad sufficient and good 
quality textbooks, instructional m
aterials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, 
including English Language Learners (ELL), are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks in core subjects for use in the class
room and to 
take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of E
ducation, making the 
textbooks used in the school the most current available.
 
 
Arvin Union School District staff member
s are actively involved in the selection process of materials and textbooks. The selection process involves 
teachers, administrators, district support personnel, and parents. The district follows the State of California's Textbook Ad
option Cycle.  100% of 
students 
had appropriate textbooks as evidenced by the most recent August 2019  Williams Review.

Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Sierra Vista Elementary School consists of 34 classrooms, three computer labs, a multipurpose room/cafeteria, a staff room, t
wo playgrounds, a new 
administrative office, library and Parent Center. The 
facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample classroom and playground space.

Modernization construction is evident at Sierra Vista Elementary with Solar Panels to support electrical cost and provide sha
de in playgrounds.
 
 
As

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to 
the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Sierra Vista pursues creating a learning community in which team members are building positive relationships and sharing best
 
teaching practices in a 
cross lateral manner. Professional development subjects are 
determined by needs of the site gathered from data recorded during classroom walk
-
throughs, learning rounds and leadership meetings. Student Collaboration Strategies, Inquiry Strategies, Close reading Strate
gies, Student engagement 
strategies, writing stru
ctures, and English Language Development have been the focus to increase student higher order thinking. Our leadership team 
has provided staff development at the site to enhance the teachers' capability to use these strategies. Staff members build t
eaching
 
skills and concepts 
by participating in various conferences and workshops as needed throughout the year. The site Academic Coach and district Tea
chers on Special 
Assignment with Administration support also provide staff development workshops throughout th
e year on topics that are relevant to staff, as well as 
in
-
class modeling and coaching.

teachers attended the AVID summer institute to be able to integrate writing, inquiry, collaboration, organization, and readin
g into teaching/lessons for 
all content areas.
 
 
Teachers are also expected to be knowledgeable with the educational
 
computer programs to facilitate student learning through a different avenue.  
Students, parents, and teachers will be able to utilize Office 365 for many purposes.
 
 
Professional growth and participation in Professional Learning Communities is an ongoing f
ocus as well as leading from the middle with support from 
InnovateEd.   Increase in capacity leads to increase in student achievement.   Team members work as a Leadership professional
 
learning community to 
implement strategies and work toward attainment of
 
the School Implementation Plan. Innovate Ed and Thoughtful Classroom focus areas guide site 
administration and leadership discussions and are focused on promoting and building strong instruction and leadership skills.
 
 
Professional development occurs inte
rnally, such as peer to peer, by the site coach and/or administration, or by the district support personnel; external 
sources such as consultants, company trainers, etc.  Professional development is provided during the day (subs are provided f
or teachers),
 
after school 
and during the summer (AVID).  Staff development has been scheduled after school as well as during the school day once a mont
h to include instructional 
assistants.  BTSA mentors and a dedicated TOSA are provided to new teachers assigned to sc
hool sites.
