By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in 
which data were collected:
 
August 2019
 
 
Core K
-
6 textbooks adopted by the San Bernardino City Unified School District Board of Education are selected from the 

 
recent local adoption. 
These materials are standards
-
based and are rigorously reviewed by San Bernardino City Unified School District textbook 
adoption committees to assure that selections will meet the unique needs of all learners, including English lang
uage 
learners, advanced learners, at
-
risk students and special needs students.  Textbooks are usually adopted for an eight
-
year 
cycle.
 
 
All core curriculum materials are available in English and Spanish.  The Board of Education ensures that standards
-
align
ed 
textbooks and/or instructional materials are purchased for each student to use in class and at home. Instructional 
materials include a variation of textbooks and/or consumables, big books and supplemental materials determined by the 
district to cover re
quired state standards. English Language Development (ELD) materials are standards
-
aligned and are 
purchased for each student who is identified as an English learner.  An inventory is completed for each classroom at every 
school site and is reported to the
 
District Office to ensure that sufficient materials are available for the new school year.  
This inventory is completed in March/April of each year to prepare for the following school year.
 
 
The district is phasing in a new science adoption, the previousl
y adopted, state framework aligned, textbooks will remain 
in use until the new adopted books are implemented at district schools. The new Science adoption is beginning in 2019 
and will be in use August of 2020.
 
 
In addition to core curriculum materials, th


program is voluntary and open to students in grades four 
through six.  Sufficient instructional materials are available for 
all students electing to participate in this music program.

General
 
Cypress Elementary School has 34 classrooms, a m
ultipurpose room, a parent center, and an administration office. The 
campus was built in 1952 and modernized in 1989 and 2012.  Four new special education classrooms were built in the

condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are provided with an appropriate learnin
g 
environment.
 
 
Safety
 
To ensure student safety before, during and after the school day, rec aides, teachers, and administrators supervise the 
school grounds including the cafeteria, quad area, and athletic fields.  Signs are posted throughout the campus t
o indicate 
all visitors must report to and register in the administration office.  All staff and visitors wear appropriate identifying 
badges.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 

s Mobile Maintenance Teams 

t 
each site reports safety issues as they arise.  Maintenance and Operations make necessary repairs to e
nsure that all 
schools are clean, safe, and functional.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and emergency repairs 
are given the highest priority and work orders are completed in a timely manner.

(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs

Every student and teacher has the right to attend a school free from physical and psychological harm. To 
help schools 
achieve these vital goals, the State of California has mandated that each K
-
12 school develop a comprehensive school 

loc
al public safety agencies, community leaders, parents, pupils, teachers, administrators, and other persons interested 

preparedness, mitigation an
d prevention, response and recovery.
 
 
In close cooperation with the California Schools Risk Management (Joint
-
Powers Authority), local police and fire 

s of district 
sites and provides correction reports to site administrators.  A follow
-
up system is in place to ensure timely compliance 
and correction of discrepancies.
 
 
School sites also conduct scheduled drills for anticipated emergency situations (such 
as fires, earthquakes and lockdowns) 
to prepare students, staff, and other stakeholders how to appropriately respond to those emergencies. The district follows 

Management 
System (NIMS) for emergency management.  The Office of Safety and Emergency Management is also tasked with 
coordinating the response and recovery of emergencies or other disasters affecting the SBCUSD.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
The common goal of all categorically funded programs in the San Bernardino City Unified School District (SBCUSD) is to 
ensure that all 
students
--
including English learners, educationally disadvantaged pupils, African American, Hispanic English 
only, gifted and talented pupils, and pupils with exceptional needs
--
attain mastery of state and local standards.
 
 
The educational program at each 
site is based on an improvement planning process that includes members of the school 
community such as the principal, teachers, support staff, parents, and students (at the secondary level). These 
stakeholders form the School Site Council (SSC). The SSC de
velops and annually monitors, evaluates and revises a plan 
called the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA). The SPSA, based on self
-
study and collaboration, ensures that all 
of the resources available to the school are coordinated and focused on prov
iding a high
-
quality educational program in 
which all students can achieve success.
 
 
Some students have difficulty mastering academic state and local content standards. They may be at risk of not meeting 
graduation requirements. For these students, categor
ical program funds are provided. Categorical funds are supplemental 
educational dollars used for supports that augment the core instructional program and increase the academic success of 
these students. Categorical funds provide items such as additional pe
rsonnel time, staff development opportunities, 
supplemental student materials, and other specialized services, equipment, and supplies.

Categorical programs commonly found at SBCUSD sites are:
 

 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Title I, Part A
 

 
Local Contr

Additionally, categorical programs have been established at the district level to provide important services and 
instructional support that help increase student success. Categorical funds in this category support District effort
s in the 
areas of:
 

 
Vocational Education Basic Grant Award (Voc Ed) 

 
Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement 
Act of 2006
 

 
ESSA Title II, Part A 

 
Supporting Effective Instruction
 

 
ESSA Title III, Part A 

 
Language Instruction for English L
earners (EL) and Language Instruction for Immigrant 
Students
 
 
Continuous Improvement
 
LEAs are encouraged to use evidence
-
based interventions that are reasonable, necessary, and consistent with Title I, Part 
A of the ESSA, to improve student achievement for
 
those students not meeting grade level standards. At the local level, 
SBCUSD identifies schools with greatest needs, based on a variety of data, including local and state student progress 
indicators, to provide additional resources and services to the sch
ools (referred to as Targeted Support for School Progress 
or TSSP). Additionally, the California Dashboard is used to identify schools and student groups in need of Comprehensive 
Support and Improvement (CSI), Targeted Support and Improvement (TSI), and Ad
ditional Targeted Support and 
Improvement (ATSI).
