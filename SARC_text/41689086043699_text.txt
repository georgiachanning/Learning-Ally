By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Hillsborough City School District inspects all of its facilities, both buildings and grounds, ye
arly to determine if any 

c 
School Instruction. Inspection by Buildings and Grounds personnel of the eight emergency facility needs 
specified in Ed. 
Code 17592.72c was last completed November 2018. The results of this facility survey are available at the District Office. 
In addition, the school district maintains a work order process to ensure efficient service and that emergency repai
rs are 
given the highest priority. Work orders can be prepared by a staff member, or suggested by a parent. Work orders are 
prioritized district
-
wide by the Supervisor of Buildings and Grounds. The district maintenance staff ensures that repairs 
necessary 
to keep the schools in good working order are completed in a timely manner.
 
 
Currently, all of our schools employ a full
-
time day custodian and a full
-
time night cleaning service. All classrooms, staff 
rooms and all student and staff restrooms are cleaned,
 
and sanitized nightly. Cleaning schedules and duties are monitored 
regularly by the sites and the maintenance department to ensure safe and clean schools. On November 5, 2002, 
Hillsborough voters passed a $66.8 million Proposition 39 bond measure to finan
ce renovation and new construction 
projects on all four campuses. The District has modernized, renovated, newly constructed and equipped housing to meet 
the instructional needs of the students. These funds, along with $2.8 million in State School Facilitie
s funds, were used to 
upgrade fire, life, safety, and accessibility standards. In addition to facilities, much needed upgrades were made to the 

 
 
A new four classroom wing, constructed with Measure B bond funds, o
pened during the spring of 2009. Repaving of the 
playground area was completed during the summer of 2009. During the summer of 2011, some paving rehabilitation work 
was completed. During the summer of 2012, bond funds were used to replace an old leased por
table classroom with a 
newer purchased portable. Additional play equipment was added to the main playground, as well as resurfacing of the 
entire area with Tot Turf. This was funded by the West Parent Group with help from District funds. In January 2013, t
he 
District was informed that the West Wing, composed of attached relocatable buildings, would no longer be allowed as a 
school building after September 30, 2015. During the summer of 2014, the West Wing was replaced with a factory built 
permanent structur
e that will last as long as any other permanently constructed building. This project was funded by 
remaining Measure B bond funds, Developer Fee funds, and a District reserve for capital projects.
 
 
During the summer of 2017, the main entrance to the playgr
ound was reconfigured and landscaped. This included a new 
secure steel gate and brick pavers. This was funded by the West Parent Group with help from District funds. Also in 2017, 
Prop 39 funding provided new occupancy sensors in all classrooms along with 
new LED exit signs.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Opportunities for parental involvement in the district and at the school site are abundant. Our parents have always given 
generously of their time, attention, and money. Their efforts mean far more than the material benefits they bring; they 
make our stude
nts and teachers feel valued and important. Such feelings contribute directly to our educational excellence.
 
 
In the 2018
-
2019 school year, parents and other community volunteers contributed thousands of hours directly to West 
School in the classrooms, in 
the library, helping with hot lunch, serving on committees, and assisting with special projects. 
Parent volunteers shelve, check
-
out and check
-
in library books, and help organize and run the Book Fair. Parents and 
community members speak to classes, read s
tories to young children, and share their occupational or scientific expertise. 
Through organizations such as the Parent Group and the School Site Council, parents learn about activities at the school 
and set goals to raise student achievement and continua
lly improve the school.
 
 
At the district level, thousands of additional volunteer hours are given to fund
-
raising events, sponsored by the 
Hillsborough Schools Foundation. Such events include the general campaign, tennis luncheon, dinner dance, and e
-
Scrip
 
program. The Hillsborough Schools Foundation provides funds annually to the district in order to enhance the already 

continually look
 
for ways to be even better.
 
 
Parents and community members have also continuously supported the schools through their votes: In June of 1988 and 
again in 1992, the community passed parcel tax measures in order to maintain school quality. In November of 20
02, the 
community of Hillsborough passed Measure B, a $66.8 million dollar school bond measure for the purpose of modernizing, 
renovating, and adding facilities as needed at our four school sites. Measure B was a Proposition 39 bond requiring a 55% 
majorit
y to pass. All members of the school community worked hard to inform the voters about the need for the measure. 
In response, the community showed its strong support for our schools by passing the Measure with a 66.45% majority 
vote.
 
 
Parents are kept well 
informed about the school through the school e
-
newsletters, social media, calendars, classroom web 
pages, parent group meetings, parent education events, and parent/teacher conferences. Any parent wishing to 
contribute time, expertise, or money to the scho
ols has ample opportunity and should start by contacting the school site 
parent group president or a member of the Hillsborough Schools Foundation. Information is also available on the district 
website: http://www.hcsd.k12.ca.us, which has links to all sch
ool websites and the Hillsborough Schools Foundation.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety is our number one priority in the Hillsborough City School District school community. We focus on maintaining safe 
and caring school communities where all students and families feel welcome, valued, and respected.  When students feel 
safe at school 
they can focus on learning.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan, developed in conjunction with the San Mateo County Office of Education and City 
Services, includes disaster preparedness and emergency procedures and provides the basic guidelines for respo
nsibilities 
and procedures needed to address major emergency situations.  This plan is updated and reviewed with staff annually.
 
HCSD has a District Safety Committee that meets a minimum of 5 times a year for planning and trainings.  The committee 
is compr
ised of two teachers per site, and two parents from each site.  The committee is responsible for keeping the 
Incident Command System organizational chart current, attend disaster preparedness trainings, and be the liaison 
between the District Safety Commit
tee and Site Safety Committee.  At the site level, the Safety Committee is responsible 
for maintaining emergency backpacks for each classroom, inventorying the emergency shed, and reviewing Big Five 
Protocols with the staff.

Each year the district offers training to its new teachers before the start of school and continues with specific new teacher
 
support for two full years, including participation in the BTSA (Beginning Teachers Support and Ass
essment) program. The 
district provides three full days of professional development for teachers each year (August, October, and March) and 
supports the continual professional growth of teachers in various ways. Teachers participate in off
-
site professiona
l 
development opportunities on a regular basis, and expert coaches and consultants work with teachers, on
-
site as well.  
The district encourages veteran teachers to grow through its HIP (Hillsborough Incentive Plan) Program, and through 
providing support f
or teachers who wish to become Nationally Board Certified. Individual teachers are encouraged to take 
classes specific to their subject area in order to ensure they meet the requirements for NCLB certification as highly 
qualified teachers. Compliance train
ing for certificated and classified staff, such as CPR/First Aid, is held as needed. 
Specialists are also provided training relevant to their assignments, and training for all involved occurs any time new 
standards or materials are adopted.
 
 
By adding inst
ructional minutes on other days, Thursday afternoons are available for both school site and district staff 
development or collaborative work groups. This is in addition to the weekly teacher, grade
-
level, and/or departmental 
collaborative time. TOSAs (Teac
hers On Special Assignment) were instituted District
-
wide to provide training for classroom 
teachers in the area of Technology Integration (2015
-
2016) and Math/Science support (2016
-
2017). Web Advisers, Data 
Advisers, and Curriculum Advisers /Lead Teachers
, also support the furtherance of the school site and district
-
wide goals. 
The administration and staff maintain a mutual support system, with close communication and strong cooperative 
planning. For the 2018
-
2019 school year, a Science Advisor role and a 
part
-

utilized to support curriculum implementation and student growth.
 
 
During the 2018
