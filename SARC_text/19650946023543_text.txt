Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The mission of Wescove School is to provide a safe and supportive environment that fosters high levels of learning for our 
diverse learning community.
 
 
All students will participate in a comprehensive and balanced language
 
arts program that includes reading, oral and 
written language to meet the state's proficiency and advanced levels of student academic achievement. This program 
encompasses phonological awareness, phonics instruction, guided oral reading practice and fluen
cy, vocabulary 
instruction, comprehension instruction, and writing. This also includes the development of fluency and comprehension 
skills of informational text, as well as a focus on developing an appreciation of literature.  Our math program will develop
 
students' ability to think, communicate, draw on mathematical ideas, and use mathematical tools and techniques to solve 
challenging problems to meet the state's proficient and advanced levels of student academic achievement. The 
mathematics curriculum is 
designed to offer students an in
-
depth and comprehensive understanding of mathematical 
computations, concepts, and applications. Kindergarten through second grade English Learner students who are assessed 
on the ELPAC (English Language Proficiency Assessme
nt for California) and score less than reasonable levels of fluency in 
English receive a minimum of 30 minutes of daily English Language Development (ELD) instruction at their fluency level. 
In addition, our ELs access the core content subjects through Spe
cially Designed Academic Instruction in English (SDAIE) 
and primary language support. Standards
-
based  ELD instruction focuses on essential English listening, speaking, reading, 
writing skills, and is directed to students' English proficiency levels.
 
 
Stud
ents in need of specialized instruction are mainstreamed as much as possible into the general education setting per 
their IEP goals. Special Education teachers work collaboratively with General Education teachers to plan instructional 
opportunities aligned
 
with the core curriculum. Modifications are made to make the core curriculum accessible to 
students. In addition, as appropriate, our Special Education students attend an Extended School Year (ESY) program in the 
summer to help maintain the knowledge lear
ned during the regular school year.  The Teacher On Special Assignment 
(TOSA) has welcome meetings with foster youth to ensure they have all the necessary resources to be successful at 
Wescove. Moreover, she monitors their academic progress and recommends 
intervention as needed to help address any 
achievement gaps.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Wescove school has sufficient classrooms, playgrounds, and staff spaces to support teaching and learning.  The district 
conducted a wireless upgrade and network upgrade (network cabin
ets, switches, and battery backups) by December 2019. 
Network improvements and new telephone systems are anticipated to be installed by the summer of 2020. The school 
takes great responsibility in making sure that the school is safe, clean, and functional.
  
To ensure the school's cleanliness, 
safety, and functionality, a facilities survey instrument is used.  The survey results are readily available in the school's 
front 
office.

Parents take an active role in their child's education by participating in a variety of school programs which include: PTA, 
School Site Council, English Learner Advisory Committee, parent education workshops, classroom volunteering, and 
special events. In 
addition, parents attend workshop/trainings held on campus by the principal, TOSA, and classroom 
teachers. Our Special Education Parent Liaison, Maria Martinez, is a parent volunteer who supports and provides guidance 
to parents who have students with disa
bilities. Our Foster Youth liaison monitors foster students and facilitates meetings 
between all the stakeholders in the child's education. Our district's unique Family Resource Center provides a range of 
services and assistance, such as tutoring, enrichme
nt programs, and community resources. Parents volunteer in the office 
as well.  Our PTA provides many opportunities for families to come together and support the school's vision.
 
 
Parents who are interested in volunteering should contact the school's offic
e manager at (626) 939
