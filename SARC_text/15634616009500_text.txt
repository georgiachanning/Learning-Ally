About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). T
he SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), 
which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more infor
mation about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page a

https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, 
Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Virginia Avenue Elementary School are currently being aligned to the Common Core
 
State Standards. 
Instructional materials are selected 
from the state's most recent list of standards
-
based materials and adopted by the State Board of Education. The 
district follows the State Board of Education's six
-
year adoption cycle for core content materials (English/language arts, math, science, and so
cial science).
 
 
On Thursday, September 12, 2019 the Fairfax School District's Board of Trustees held a public hearing to certify the extent t
o which textbooks and 
instructional materials have been provided to students. The Board of Trustees adopted Resolut
ion No. 2020
-
01 which certifies as required by Education 
Code ยง60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional materials were provided to all students, including English learners, in the 
district to the extent that each 
pupil has a textbook or instructional mat
erials, or both, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials were 
provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with 
the cycles and con
tent of 
the curriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English/language arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materia
ls used for their visual/pe
rforming 
arts curricula. During the 2019
-
20 school year, the Fairfax School District did not offer visual/performing arts classes and therefore did not require the 
distribution of respective textbooks and instructional materials.
