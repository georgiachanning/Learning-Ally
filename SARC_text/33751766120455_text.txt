Like the roaring '20s, our district is poised to make some noise in 2020!
 
LEUSD student 
accountability showed meaningful gains with the latest California School Dashboard 

focus on Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) to provide teachers and 
principals with critical 
performance data to guide daily instruction, helping students succeed!
 
 

open in August of 2020. This new TK
-
5 school will feature 
state
-
of
-
the
-
art solar energy efficiency, 
flexible classroom furniture and configurable classroom space, exciting classroom technology, and 
advanced campus security systems.
 
 
Recent facilities projects funded by the recent Measure V school bond include fle
xible classroom 
furniture, artificial turf replacement, playground refurbishment, LED lighting conversions, and 
classroom technology purchases. Grant funded CTE program expansion will significantly update our 
existing engineering, agriculture, and medical 
career pathways. All LEUSD high school performing 
arts centers have recently received state
-
of
-
the
-
art sound and lighting upgrades, and new theater 
seating plus stage refurbishments are coming next.
 
 
A previously shuttered campus in Wildomar, Jean Hayman E
lementary, was reopened this summer 
under a new development plan that will unfold over the next five years. Phase 1 tenant 
improvements were recently completed to accommodate the Southern California EMS Training 
Institute. Phase 2 will include refurbishmen
t of the existing multipurpose room for professional 
development, staff training, community meeting rooms, and expanded parking. Phases 3 and 4 
include the relocation of existing adult education programs, new site
-
based child care, plus 
separate parking. P
hase 5 will complete the relocation of our existing Adult Transition Program; 
also, installation of affordable housing for teachers as an incentivized recruitment strategy, 
enabling LEUSD to stay competitive in a statewide teacher shortage.
 
 
As you can see
, 2020 and the beginning of a new decade has plenty for everyone to shout about!
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Dr. Doug Kimberly, Superintendent

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Lake Elsinore Unified School District (LEUSD) is committed to maintaining a safe, secure, and aesthetically pleasing envi
ronment for our students. 
The LEUSD Governing Board has adop
ted cleaning standards for all schools in the District. A summary of these standards is
 
available at the school office and at the District Office. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop clea
ning schedules to ensure a clean 
and safe s
chool. In addition to District
-
level support of routine and periodic maintenance needs, LEUSD holds high standards for cleanliness, appearance, 
and good repair of all campuses daily and maintains them through the efforts of the students, staff, day custodi
an, evening custodial crew, and District 
Maintenance Department. Our maintenance staff ensures the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working ord
er are completed in a 
timely manner.
 
 
A work
-
order process is used to ensure efficient ser
vice and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. LEUSD regularly assesses maintenance, 
modernization, and new construction needs. Any pesticide use at our school sites is in compliance with the Healthy Schools Ac
t of 2000.
 
 
Fire drill evacua
tions are conducted on a monthly basis at all elementary and middle schools, and twice a year at the high schools in the Dist
rict. A fire 
safety inspection is conducted once each year by the Riverside County Fire Department, while site personnel conduct si
te inspections on a regular basis.
 
 

ementary school and middle 
school, and once each semester at the high schools.
 
 
Currently, the 
District provides storage areas for emergency supplies to be kept on campus in the event of a disaster. A radio communication
 
system 
allows for continuous communication with the District office in the event of a disaster.
 
 
A Crisis Intervention Team has be
en identified and trained to deal with stress experienced by students and staff as a result of a crisis situation. Team 
members are called upon to assist across the District as necessary. As part of the comprehensive School Safety Program, Schoo
l Resource 
Officers provide 
prevention and intervention procedures on all LEUSD campuses at least part time.
 
 
Our school was built in 2002. It has 26 regular classrooms, six science labs, eight portables, a library, a computer lab, a m
ultipurpose room, and five 
speci
al education rooms. The designed capacity of the school is 1,300 students. Athletic facilities include a gym, dance room, and
 
outside courts and 
fields.
 
 
A progressive discipline plan is in place and multiple discipline and Character Counts assemblies are 
conducted throughout the year. Four campus 
supervisors and a part
-
time School Resource Officer also help maintain a safe environment. The WE TIP program is utilized so that students may repor
t 
crime anonymously and all leads are followed up immediately.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
