Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Scho
ol Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Sandpiper School remains in good condition with few repairs needed. The district has a long term maintenance rotation 
to bring the conditions of all facilities in good repair. 
Grounds are kept neat and well
-
trimmed throughout the year and 
grass and flowers are watered and maintained.
 
 
Age of Buildings:
 
Sandpiper School was built in 1997. There are currently 25 general education classrooms and 1 Learning Center (resource 
room). I
n addition, there is a library, a Behavior Intervention room, two Specialist rooms, and a Science room. In the 
summer of 2013, Sandpiper added a Kindergarten classroom, expanded the Administrative Offices, and added a set of 
Adult Bathrooms in the back of 
campus for staff. In December of 2017, Sandpiper completed a new construction expansion 
project, which resulted in the opening of 10 additional classrooms and an expanded campus.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair:
 
District maintenance staff, assisted as necessary by
 
outside contractors, keeps the school in good repair. Work orders are 
completed in a timely manner and tracked on a computerized system of record
-
keeping, which also allows priority to be 
assigned to emergency repairs.
 
 
Complaints and Reports of Condition

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of 
study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
A school safety plan is revised and adopted each year. Specific procedures for evacuation of buildings, communication and 
disbursement of emergency supplies are outlined in an emergency handbook in the office. Specific responsibilities are 
given to adults 
for the supervision of students in a safe location when a disaster occurs. Fire Drills, Shelter in Place, Secure 
Campus, Lock Down, and Earthquake disaster drills are practiced during the school year in cooperation with the local fire 
and police department
s. Staff telephone trees and a parent notification system has been established. Emergency supplies 
are updated each year or upon their expiration date. 
 
 
Emergency Procedures for Sandpiper School as described in the school's Emergency Plan: 
 
 
Should an eme
rgency situation occur while school is in session, such as an earthquake, chemical spill, power failure, civil 

 

 
School will notify parents through School Messenger email and/or phone call, if possible, of the reunification 
process and potential alternate location for student pickup.
 

 
No student will be released from school unless a parent (or individual listed on the
 
emergency card) comes for 
him/her.
 

 
No student will be released unless a parent/individual shows proper government
-
issued ID. NO EXCEPTIONS.
 

 
Name and destination of the student will be documented on the master school roster before releasing the 
student; pa
rent must print and sign name on the master school roster upon student release.
 
We do ask your help in the following areas: 
 

 
Please DO NOT CALL THE SCHOOL! We must have the phone lines open for emergency calls.
 

 
As soon as possible, come to school to pick u
p your child in a calm and orderly fashion. Please be patient with 
staff as we work to reunite all adults and children.
 

 
Please WALK TO SCHOOL, IF POSSIBLE. If you must drive, park in designated parking spaces only. Leave the 
driveway clear for emergency ve
hicles.
 

 
If at the direction of public officials (fire, police, etc.), the children have been relocated to another site for safety, 
an announcement will be made through School Messenger email and/or phone call, if possible.
