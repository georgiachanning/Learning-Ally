School Description
 
 

School in 1994.  Clear View was a conversion charter school as part of the Chula Vista Elementary 

 

received numerous awards thanks to a vital partnership between school, home, and community. 
In the 2008
-
09 school year, the staff voted to return to district status, no longer operating as a 
charter.
 
 
The school is 
located just up the hill from the Terra Nova Shopping Center. Beautifully landscaped 
grounds and a 37 ton fossil rock greet visitors, staff, and students.  The campus is arranged in a pod
-
like format, with four classrooms and a workroom in each pod. On the
 
Clear View campus there are 
five pods with an additional building housing six classrooms and a workroom as well as an on site 
childcare center operated by the South Bay YMCA.  Currently, Clear View has 26 teachers 
(Preschool
-
6 grades), one principal, one 
resource teacher that is shared 50% with another site, and 
one full
-
time Resource Specialist.  Clear View is unique in that it offers a Dual Language Immersion 
Spanish/English program for grades TK
-
6.  In addition, Clear View has three Moderate to Severe 
S
pecial Day Classes TK
-
6 and two Preschool Special Day classes.
 
 
Mission
 
 
As a nurturing learning community, Clear View School develops the knowledge and thinking skills 
and attitudes which empower all students to become influential contributors in an ever 
changing 
global society. Above all else, Clear View stands for relationships and success to build leaders.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains
 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes 
how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SAR
C requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school 
district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Research shows a high correlation between parent involvement and effective schools.  We encou
rage parents to visit and become active in our school.  
Parents are encouraged to read to their children at home, provide cultural activities, encourage mental math, and attend scho
ol functions with their 
children.
 
 
Clear View School has a School Site Coun
cil, Parent
-
Teacher Association and an ELAC Committee for parents of English Learners. The PTA sponsors 
projects for the benefit and welfare of our children and the community.  Parents and members of the community volunteered mor
e than 8,000 hours in 
our c

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Based on careful review of statewide, local and school site assessment, and a new textbook adoption, it was determined that s
taff would be provided 
with professional development in the area of Shared Reading and Social and Emotional Learning during the 201
8
-
2019 school year after concluding a 
three year focus on math problem solving. Teachers were working on developing student self
-
efficacy through clear expectations of student success and 
developing relationships. For the 2019
-
2020 school year, data reveal
ed the need to focus on the language development of all students. Collaborative 
conversations/discussions have been the focus of our PLCs this year. Additionally, Clear View has become a Leader in Me schoo
l and has dedicated 
professional develop time and r
esources to making this transition.
 
 
Our school professional development around collaborative conversations has been largely directed by our Instructional Leaders
hip Team (ILT), made up 
from one teacher at each grade level.  Throughout each quarter our ILT
 
team meets during school hours and develops a professional learning cycle based 
on articles or research about our topic. Each PLC includes staff meeting topics, collaboration focus, guided classroom visits
, and opportunities for vertical 
articulation with
in the staff.  During Bi
-
Monthly in school collaboration, teachers build their learning on topics related to our PLC, share resources, plan 
lessons, and analyze student work/data.
 
 
Teachers are supported through continual professional development and princ
ipal feedback based on teacher needs.  Additionally, student data is 
regularly used to guide next steps in our learning as teachers.  As a Leader in Me school, our staff has received two full da
y trainings from Leader in Me 
trainers and we have created a L
ighthouse team which meets regularly and provides professional development for the staff.
 
 
As a site, we will work with our ILT and district support to focus professional development for teachers on collaborative con
versations and implementation 
of high im
pact language strategies with fidelity.  Our Professional development plan will continue to include in school ILT meetings, s
taff meetings on 
Friday early release days, during bi
-
monthly collaboration.  Teachers will be supported with this implementation t
hrough feedback and coaching from 
the principal based on student formal and informal data.  In addition, our District Resource Teacher will continue to provide
 
resources for teachers, model 
lessons, and support with planning and implementation.
