School Description
 
Liberty School was the 41st school in the Chula Vista Elementary School District, which now has 49 
schools, including charters. Liberty is located in an area of relatively new homes and new 
construction. We opened in July 2004 with 300 students and have gr
own over the years to a 
population of 749 students and currently at 729 students. Most of our students live in single family 
dwellings. Approximately 15% of our students qualify for free or reduced
-
price meals and 17% are 
English Learners. Our school popul
ation is rich in ethnic diversity.
 
 
Mission
 
Liberty School provides a safe, nurturing, supportive learning environment for every member of 
the school community. We foster the continuous academic and social growth of all students by 
engaging them in challen
ging, enriching learning experiences that meet their individual needs and 
prepare them for life in the 21st century. This is accomplished by immersing students in a 
standards
-
based curriculum that demonstrates relevance to their lives, provides in
-
depth 
ex
periences in all curricular areas, and provides a strong foundation for future learning. The 
building blocks of the academic program are commitment, competency, communication and 
collaboration. Staff members take responsibility for basing instruction on be
st practices by 
engaging in ongoing professional development through research, reading, and collaboration. 
Teachers are adept at using ongoing assessments and data to guide instruction. Techniques, 
strategies, and results are shared with parents on an ongo
ing basis, thereby giving parents the 
opportunity to be true partners in the academic and social growth of their children.
 
 
Teachers use the results of standardized tests and other District and site
-
specific formative and 
summative assessments to identify 
learning strengths and gaps, to design the instructional 
program, and to determine staff development needs.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

have a Parent Teacher 
Committee (PTC) that is very active and supportive of the school. The PTC organizes sc
hool
-
wide activities such as the annual Mother/Son and 
Father/Daughter Dances, Festival, and Family Movie Nights. It also supports the educational focus by helping to  purchase boo
ks for the library. Every 
class has a PTC room parent who serves as a room p

-
specific activities.
 
 
Other parent involvement opportunities include our School Site Council (SSC) comprised of parents, teachers, the principal, a
nd other school personnel. 
Members are elected every two years and oversee the ca
tegorical budget of the school, as well as develop the Single Site Plan for school improvement 
and the Emergency Procedures Plan. Family Read is a monthly event where families come to school, learn a reading strategy, an
d then go and read with 
their child(
ren).
 
 
The English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) is comprised of parents, teachers, the principal, and other school personnel. 
This group shares 
information and studies issues and concerns relating to the second language acquisition program at the 
school.
 
 
We also have opportunities for parents and community members to volunteer for various functions throughout the year. Family R
ead is one example. 
The first Friday of the month, parents come and read with their children. they first meet with the pri
ncipal for a reading mini
-
lesson for 10 minutes and 
then read with their child(ren) for 20 minutes. We have more than 100 parents who attend this event. Additionally, we have a 
variety of parents who 
volunteer to run after school clubs such as Robotics, ar
t, garden club and co
-
coach on our Kickball, Basketball and Soccer teams.
 
 
The Liberty PTC, parent group, works closely with the school in developing events for students and parents; ie. parent/child 
dances, spring carnival, APEX 
Fun Run, talent show and m
ore.
 
 
Outside of these formal structures, parents and community members are always welcome to volunteer in the classrooms at any ti
me upon arrangements 
with the individual teachers.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Liberty has had a strong professional development plan for the past three years (2016
-
17, 2017
-
18 and 
2018
-
19). In Year one, we focused on writing with 

 
our newly adopted 
Benchmark program and continued our study of GLAD strategies. 
Year three our focus is on Teacher Clarity through focusing on Success Criteria. We also 
started the year with a focus on the Social Emotional Learning program, Sanford Harmony and building teacher/student relation
ships. Student proficiency 
grew in all are
as over the three years, especially for our English Language learners. Currently, in year 2019
-
20 our instructional focus is Teacher Clarity in 
Mathematics. We identified the Learning Intentions and Success Criteria during math instructions based on the ma
th common core state standards.
 
 
Outside consultants, in
-
house teacher leaders including the school Resource Teacher created and implemented the professional development. The 
Liberty ILT receives professional development training 5 full days per year by th
e district and we meet at least monthly for 3 hours.
