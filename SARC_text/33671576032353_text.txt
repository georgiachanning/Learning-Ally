School Description
 
Nuview Elementary School is part of the Nuview Union School District which is located in the rural 
community of Nuevo, in Riverside County. 
Nuview Elementary School promotes success for all 
students through our rigorous academic program taught by our highly dedicated staff. Our mission 

meanin

-
like focus on our goals: We believe 
that all students can learn. We will provide high quality instruction at all times. We will work to 
increase the English proficiency of our English learners and t
o equip our students with the social 
skills needed to be successful learners. We have many programs in place to help support the 
students we serve including:
 

 
Elementary S.T.E.M. (Science Technology Engineering and Math) Lab 
-
Our 3rd through 
6th graders wor

incorporate collaborative learning through real
-
world scientific exploration.
 

 
Positive Behavior Intervention Supports (P.B.I.S.) School 

 
We incorporate P.B.I.S. school 
wide. This theory that
 
we have adopted believes that all behaviors occur within an 
environmental context. We systematically teach and acknowledge appropriate 
behaviors using universal expectations and social skills teaching.
 
 
Kindness is our school focus and students are recogni
zed for their acts of kindness on campus. 
Additionally, students are provided with a Kindness Matters curriculum to teach important skills 
with treating others properly and understanding others feelings.
 

 
English Language Development Program (ELD) 
-
 
Each gr
ade level levels their English 
learners for the dedicated ELD time block. Grade level teams collaborate and plan 
lessons that address not only the state adopted standards by the ELD standards as well. 
Each year our goal for our English learners is to incre
ase one proficiency band as 
measured by the ELPAC.
 

 
We have implemented a school
-
wide reading intervention program to address the 
reading comprehension and decoding deficits of our struggling readers. This Tier II 
intervention program is taught by our two T
eachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) who 
not only provide a direct service to our students but act as a coach for our certificated 
staff. Our lower grade students are provided reading instruction through our Leveled 
Literacy Intervention program and our up
per grade students are served with the READ 
180 program.
 
W
e are confident that it is the children, teachers, parents and families of the community that 
provide the necessary ingredients for our success. We invite you to experience us first hand by 
voluntee
ring in the classroom, or at the many school events that are held throughout the year.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructi
onal Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The school district held a public hearing on October 10, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had suffic
ient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to
 
the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. T
extbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by a
ll teach
ers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.
 
 
The table displays information 
collected in September

School Facility Conditions and Planned
 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Nuview Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. School facilities were built
 
in 1951 and encompass 13 
acres of land. Facilities span 46,403 square feet and include 25 
classrooms, a library, a computer lab, a multipurpose room, administrative offices, 
preschool and general child care.. The campus features a wide array of recreational and sports areas, including playground eq
uipment, a basketball court, 
grass and blacktop
 
play areas, and a baseball diamond. The facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample classroom and play
ground 
space, and a staff resource room.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
The district administers a scheduled maintenance program, includi
ng regular facilities inspections, to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well
-
maintained and in good repair. When necessary, the district takes appropriate actions to ensure campus facilities are in good
 
working order and provide 
a clean and saf
e environment for all members of the school community. A work order process immediately alerts district personnel of any main
tenance 
needed to be performed and ensures that emergencies are given the highest priority. At the time this report was published, 
100% of the restrooms on 
campus were in good working order. Additionally, the entire campus was painted during the summer of 2018.  There were classro
oms that received new 
carpet during the summer of 2018 as well.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
The district governing b
oard has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the school 
office 
or at the district office. The site administration team works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules t
o ensure a clean and safe school. 
Nuview Elementary School has one full
-
time and two part
-
time custodians to provide janitorial and maintenance services on campus.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical

ire drills are conducted monthly and evacuation drills are conducted annually.  Additionally, lock down and 
hold and secure drills are practiced regularly and important safety information and training is shared with students before a
nd after these drills.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan was developed in 1999 by the district in cooperation with local law enforcement in order
 
to comply with Senate 
Bill 187 of 1997. The plan provides students and staff a means to ensure a safe and orderly learning enviro
nment. Components of the Comprehensive 
School Safety Plan include: child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupils procedures, disaster r
esponse procedures, 
procedures for safe entering to, and exiting from, school, sexual harass
ment policy, suspension and expulsion policies, dress code, and discipline policies. 
The plan is updated annually in the spring and shared with school staff at the beginning of each school year. A copy of the p
lan is available to the public 
at the district
 
office.
