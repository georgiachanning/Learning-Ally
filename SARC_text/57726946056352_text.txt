which
 
describes
 
how
 
they
 
intend
 
to
 
meet
 
annual
 
school-specific
 
goals
 
for
 
all
 
pupils,

Description
 
and
 
Mission
 
Statement
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
Elkhorn
 
Village
 
Elementary
 
School
 
is
 
committed
 
to
 
providing
 
a
 
safe
 
environment
 
in
 
which
 
all
 
students
 
may
 
excel.
 
We
 
use
 
the
 
structures
 
of
 
the
 
BEST
 
program
 
to
 
teach
 
all
 
students
 
expected
 
behaviors
 
that
 
maintain
 
a
 
physically
 
and
 
emotionally
 
safe
 
place
 
to
 
learn
 
about
 
themselves
 
and
 
the
 
world
 
around
 
them.
 
We
 
have
 
also
 
incorporated
 
the
 
Olweus
 
Anti-Bullying
 
program,
 
using
 
weekly
 
class
 
meetings,
 
a
 
school-wide
 
rally,
 
and
 
on-going
 
staff
 
development
 
to
 
increase
 
awareness
 
of
 
bullying,
 
and
 
structures
 
and
 
strategies
 
for
 
intervention.
 
Students
 
and
 
staff
 
participate
 
in
 
the
 
Each
 
One
 
Reach
 
One
 
program
 
to
 
highlight
 
positive
 
behaviors
 
students
 
can
 
do
 
each
 
day
 
of
 
the
 
week
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
more
 
inclusive
 
environment
 
for
 
all,
 
while
 
developing
 
each
 
student™s
 
personal
 
skills
 
and
 
habits.
 
Our
 
Peer
 
Mediation
 
Program
 
trains
 
students
 
in
 
communication
 
skills
 
to
 
help
 
classmates
 
solve
 
problems
 
before
 
they
 
escalate.
 
 
We
 
foster
 
an
 
atmosphere
 
that
 
encourages
 
college
 
for
 
all.
 
We
 
offer
 
AVID
 
classes
 
in
 
the
 
upper
 
grades
 
to
 
help
 
students
 
master
 
the
 
organizational
 
and
 
academic
 
skills
 
that
 
will
 
allow
 
them
 
to
 
be
 
successful
 
in
 
the
 
high
 
level
 
courses
 
required
 
for
 
admission
 
into
 
four
 
year
 
colleges.
 
Elkhorn
 
is
 
the
 
first
 
K-8
 
school
 
in
 
Washington
 
Unified
 
to
 
receive
 
certification
 
by
 
the
 
AVID
 
Center.
 
 
Teachers
 
meet
 
regularly
 
to
 
analyze
 
student
 
achievement
 
and
 
plan
 
lessons
 
based
 
on
 
student
 
needs.
 
Peer
 
training
 
is
 
a
 
regular
 
component
 
of
 
site
 
collaboration
 
days.
 
Outside
 
consultants
 
have
 
been
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
site
 
training,
 
increasing
 
all
 
teachers'
 
knowledge
 
of
 
ELD
 
and
 
SDAIE
 
strategies.
 
Elkhorn
 
has
 
a
 
very
 
successful
 
MESA
 
program
 
that
 
now
 
provides
 
experiences
 
for
 
elementary
 
students
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
our
 
junior
 
high
 
program.
 
We
 
offer
 
classes
 
in
 
robotics
 
and
 
design
 
to
 
challenge
 
students
 
who
 
choose
 
to
 
pursue
 
additional
 
science
 
and
 
math
 
opportunities,
 
and
 
continue
 
to
 
search
 
for
 
more
 
opportunities
 
to
 
develop
 
STEM
 
(Science,
 
Technology,
 
Engineering
 
and
 
Mathematics)
 
classes
 
for
 
all
 
grades.
 
We
 
continue
 
to
 
provide
 
an
 
option
 
for
 
bilingual
 
education
 
for
 
students
 
in
 
kindergarten
 
through
 
third
 
grade.
 
Our
 
bilingual
 
teachers
 
work
 
closely
 
together
 
to
 
provide
 
a
 
sustainable
 
program
 
developing
 
academic
 
English
 
skills
 
equal
 
to
 
or
 
greater
 
than
 
general
 
education
 
classes.

Plan
 
(School

Elkhorn
 
Village
 
Elementary
 
School
 
prides
 
itself
 
in
 
keeping
 
students
 
safe
 
before,
 
during,
 
and
 
after
 
school.
 
To
 
ensure
 
student
 
and
 
staff
 
safety,
 
the
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
is
 
reviewed,
 
revised,
 
and
 
updated
 
every
 
year.
 
Staff
 
participates
 
in
 
regular
 
training
 
on
 
parts
 
of
 
the
 
safety
 
plan
 
throughout
 
the
 
school
 
year.
 
We
 
have
 
worked
 
with
 
the
 
West
 
Sacramento
 
Police
 
Department
 
and
 
WUSD
 
to
 
increase
 
staff
 
awareness
 
and
 
knowledge
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
effective
 
responses
 
to
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
situations
 
that
 
threaten
 
the
 
orderly
 
environment
 
of
 
our
 
school.
 
A
 
working
 
site
 
safety
 
team
 
meets
 
frequently
 
to
 
ensure
 
all
 
staff
 
is
 
current
 
on
 
all
