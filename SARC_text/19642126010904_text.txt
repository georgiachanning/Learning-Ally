A Message from the Principal
 
Carver Academy  is
 
known throughout L.A. county for its outstanding Schoolwide Enrichment 
Clusters Program. Recognizing that all learners are unique, learning experiences must take into 
account the abilities, interest, and learning style of individual students.  Twice a yea
r during the six 
week cluster, students spend one hour a week exploring a topic of interest with the assistance of 
knowledgeable community members.  Along with gaining in
-
depth insight into a particular topic, 
students begin to take responsibility and inte
rest in their own learning.  The regular curriculum is 
supported, expanded and enhanced by children participating in enrichment activities and bringing 
their enthusiasm into the classroom setting.  Student and cluster leaders communicate what they 
have acc
omplished at a schoolwide celebration to culminate the Enrichment Clusters Program.  
These educational opportunities, supported by an excellent teaching staff, create a first rate 
educational opportunity that is both challenging and enjoyable for Carver Ac
ademy students.  Our 
school has received accolades from the California Business for Education Excellence (CBEE) Star 
School in Math and Science, Title 1 Academic Achievement Award, California Gold Ribbon, 
California Distinguished School, the California Sch
ool Boards' Golden Bell, the New and Emerging 
Magnet School Award and the California Business for Education Excellence (CBEE) Star School. Also, 
a team of our fifth grade students competed and won the Science Olympics at the Los Angeles 
County Office of Ed
ucation, where dozens of teams from districts throughout the county competed 
to take home the title.
 
 
Carver Academy is located in the city of Cerritos and serves 639 students in grades preschool 
through sixth.  Our calendar is based on a traditional schoo
l year from August to June. We are 
dedicated to ensuring the academic success of every student and providing a safe and 
comprehensive educational experience.
 
 
Carver Academy is a school community where the highest expectations are maintained. All 
available
 
resources are utilized to enable students to become life
-
long learners who possess the 
ability to achieve their utmost potential. We promote a safe, nurturing, and stimulating 
environment that invites students to actively participate in educational opport
unities. Carver 
provides a welcoming atmosphere in which parents and community members are encouraged to 
become immersed in our students' educational endeavors. Individual academic and social needs of 
staff and students are met, creating a desirable enviro
nment where all participants are successful.
 
 
We believe there are character traits that our students must learn to be members of the Carver 
Community and to achieve continual academic success.  Our students know that Carver CARES! 
Carver Cubs are Compassi
onate, have A Positive Attitude, are Respectful, Enthusiastic and always 
Strive for Excellence.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
As effective worldwide communicators, Carver Academy students will be critical thinkers and 
inquisitive learners, with a sense of personal co
mmitment to action and service.  Our staff will 
provide preschool through sixth grade students with rich learning experiences in a nurturing and 
challenging academic environment.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a Scho
ol Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local C
ontrol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data
 
reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should 
contact the school principal or the 
district office.

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Parent and community volunteers assist teachers, office staff and serve as facilitators in our Magnet Enrichment Cluster prog
ram.
 
 
Community Partnerships:
 
The school works in
 
conjunction with the City of Cerritos Senior Center to enhance students' education, and social and emotional growth.  The stu
dents 
participate monthly in activities based on grade level curriculum such as nutrition, physical education and sensitivity to a
ging.  Additionally, the seniors 
serve as book buddies and pen pals which provides extra practice for students in reading and writing.  The highlight of our p
artnership is the sixth grade 
vs. Seniors softball game.  Students gain an appreciation and unders
tanding for older adults when they see seniors up to 81 years of age successfully 
competing in the game.
 
 
The Cerritos Performing Arts Center offers students the opportunity to attend and participate in theatrical performances.  Ac
tivities are chosen that 
correlate with grade level curriculum.  Teachers are afforded Staff Development in order to incorporate additional lessons wi
thin the classroom.
 
 
Numerous programs are enriched by the generous contributions to Carver Academy from the following organization
s:
 

 
Artesia Historical Society
 

 
Box Tops for Education
 

 
Carver PTA
 

 
ABC Education Foundation
 

 
Lifetouch

Our teachers actively seek opportunities for professional growth to provide effective instruction with the focus on student l
earning.  Staff development 
is based on the assessed needs of the school personnel. Staff members work collaboratively to determine
 
the school's needs and take direction from 
District and State requirements when establishing professional development goals for the school year.  Schoolwide training fo
cus areas include Common 
Core State Standards in both language arts and mathematics, Sw
un mathematics, English Language Development, GATE, technology, using data to drive 
instruction and effective strategies for behavior management. Staff members build teaching skills and concepts by participati
ng in many site supported 
coaching sessions and
 
workshops throughout the year and by sharing their experiences and knowledge with colleagues.
