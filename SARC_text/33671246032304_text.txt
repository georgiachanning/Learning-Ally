School Description:
 
 
Edgemont Elementary School is the newest elementary campus in the district, boasting over 67,000 
square feet, 32 state of the art classrooms and collaborative spaces throughout the building for 
21st century learning. We are the recipient of The Gold Ribb
on (for outstanding school
-
community 
partnerships) and the Title I Academic Achievement Award. Academic success, such as that which 
we experience at Edgemont Elementary School, occurs when school and family work in partnership 
towards a common goal. We hol
d high expectations for our students and we will hold them 
responsible for their own learning and accountable for their own behavior choices. By doing that, 
our students can take pride in their accomplishments and we can take pride in our kids!
 
 
We continu
e to teach specific behavioral expectations for our students following the research
-

monitoring, and evaluating this process, we hope to instill intrinsic motivation 
in the hearts and 
minds of our students so they can learn to choose to do the right thing in all circumstances. 
Choosing to do the right thing feels better and helps our kids to develop pride and integrity. We 


 
 
S = Safe
 
 
O = On Task
 
 
A = Accountable
 
 
R = Respectful
 
 
We hope you will partner with us as we continue our journey on this PBIS adventure because, to 
do it right, we will need your support!
 
 
STEAM Pathway
 
This year Edgemont is proud to be 
a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts, and 
Mathematics) Pathway school. The STEAM pathway provides students with opportunities for 
inquiry based learning and rich academic conversations that prepare our students to be 21st 
century learners. S
tudents participate in monthly STEAM Labs that have ranged from Digital 
Citizenship to using Code and Go Mice to deepen their understanding of coding. Teachers are 
encouraged to use these STEAM Labs as catalysts that inspire future STEAM lessons that they 
plan 
within their own classrooms.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountab
ility Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and A
ccountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in
 
the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, 
see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district offi
ce.

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Edgemont Elementary annually reviews the Safe School Plan and the Disaster Preparedness Plan. The Safe School Plan summarizes
 
the current status of 
school crime committed on school campuses and 
at school
-
related functions, the identification of appropriate strategies and programs that will provide 
or maintain a high level of school safety, and addresses procedures for complying with existing laws related to school safety
. The Plan also includes t
he 
District discipline policy, which gives the consequences for student misconduct (such as detention, Saturday School, suspensi
on, and expulsion).
 
 
The Disaster Preparedness Plan outlines guidelines and procedures for responding during disasters and emergency situations. F
ire drills are held once a 
month and earthquake drills are done quarterly.The School Safety Plan was last reviewed, updated, and di
scussed with school staff on October 09, 2019.
