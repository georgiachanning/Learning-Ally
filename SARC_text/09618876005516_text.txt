By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

the cycles and content of the curriculum frameworks within two months of the beginning of the school year in which this 
determination is made.
 
 
All of our instructional materials are current and of good quality.   Additional resources supporting our instructional 
program are:  an instrumental music room and a performing arts stage, a school library/media center, and six Computer 
on Wheels (COW) wh
ich consists of 36 Chromebooks and can be moved to any location on campus. Our 
gymnasium,complete with locker rooms, supports our full physical education program , our school athletic programs and

CURRICULUM IMPROVEMENT
 
Gol

information between the administration, teachers, other school personnel, parents, and interested members of the 
community.  Staff, student and co
mmunity input is valued for master planning each year.  Current targets for improvement 
include the use of a web
-
based software for student use to enhance instruction and improve student performance.  
Trained teacher leaders provide training for curriculum
 
teams and beginning teachers.
 
 
In Spring 2017, teachers attended county review meetings to evaluate History and Social Studies curriculum to be 
considered for adoption.  Vendors provided additional information and grade level teams further discussed and 
i
nvestigated programs before choosing.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil A
chievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California A
lternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achie
vement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance
 
to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Students who feel good about themselves and have opportunities to receive 
recognition are inclined to perform better 
academically and socially.  Gold Trail reinforces positive learning through Honor Roll Awards, Athletic Awards, Honor Band, 
and many individual classroom award programs.  There are many enrichment opportunities, i
ncluding groups and clubs 
that students may join to promote learning and a positive school climate.  Community members may be recognized by 
the Board for service to the district through the Gold Nugget Award or other acknowledgements.  Gold Trail School of
fers 
many after
-
school sports opportunities to develop athletic prowess, sportsmanship, and teamwork.
 
 
The staff at Gold Trail School does not tolerate name calling, teasing, or bullying.  Each behavior and discipline case is 
handled 
individually and options are fully explored to remedy the situation.  The students have on
-
going awareness and 
incentive programs to discourage bullying and harassment.  Students in grades four through eight participate in weekly 
classes of TEACH which is 
a student empowerment and bullying prevention program.  Eighth grade students can 
participate in the We Belong (WEB) program which is a leadership and community building program.
 
 
Cameras were installed on the school site in various locations and are monit
ored during the day to increase campus 
security.  Gold Trail School has a safety plan located in every classroom.  The plan details procedures for such emergencies 
as bomb threats, intruders, and earthquakes.  Earthquake, fire, and lock down drills are pra
cticed regularly, and an entire 
site evacuation
-
by
-
bus drill is conducted annually to ensure the safety of the students in an emergency.  Every year the 
comprehensive plan is reviewed by staff and parents, modified if necessary, and updated with county and
 
emergency 
service providers.   The final document is approved by the District Advisory Committee (DAC) and Gold Trail Board annually.
