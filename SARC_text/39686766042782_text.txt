About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to 
publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to pre
pare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consis
tent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more informatio
n about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school prin
cipal or the 
district office.

Quali

-

The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes fo
r all students. The law also 
asks distric
ts to reveal whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far more meaningful
 
when along with 

find the names of the textbooks used 
in our core classes and their dates of publication.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Tyler Skills school site has over 20 classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library, a computer lab and an administration buildin
g.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest p
riority.
 
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that all classrooms, restrooms, and facilities are 
well
-
maintained and in good 
repair. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to e
nsure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Stockton Unified takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, we
 
utilize the facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California OPSC. The full report 
is available upon request.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to 
the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education po
pulation and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are
 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satis
fy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 

s custodial team ensures 
the school facilities are in compliance w
ith all federal and state health and safety regulations. Each year a deep cleaning process occurs during the summer 
& winter breaks.
 
 
In the event of a facility plant emergency, the principal notifies appropriate site and district personnel to resolve the 
emergency and safely secure or 
evacuate the students, based upon the site and district emergency preparedness plans.
 
 
A comprehensive School Safety Plan helps to provide a secure, peaceful, and clean environment for the school community. The s

ness and 
Emergency Management for Schools plan identifies procedures to follow during emergencies and natural disasters. Emergency dri
lls are conducted on a 
regular basis.
 
 
Every effort is made to ensure students are monitored while on campus throughout th
e school day. Yard supervisors, Campus Safety Assistant, teachers, 
site administrators and school staff provide supervision for students before and during school. The playground is safe for al
l students. All visitors must 
sign in at the office and receive 
proper authorization to be on campus and must display their assigned one
-
day badge at all times. The Comprehensive 
School Safety Plan was adopted by the SSC in December of 2015 and was reviewed with Faculty and Staff on August 8th 2016.
