School Description
 

 
Mission Statement: The mission of the staff, parents, and community of North Ranchito is to 
prepare our students to participate, appreciate, and flourish in the rich cultural heritage of their 
community and to successfully navigate through an increasingly 
globalized world. To prepare our 
students to be global citizens, we will foster a nurturing climate that promotes humanity and a 
passion for lifelong learning. Driven by research
-
based principles, we are committed to providing 
our students with the tools t
o promote creativity, critical
-
thinking, communication and 
collaboration. In meeting these 21st century goals we, as teachers and leaders, employ established 
educational theory, innovative strategies, Standards
-
based instruction and assessment, data 
analys
is, and reflection to promote the academic excellence of all students.
 
 
At North Ranchito, every staff member at the school is focused on improving student achievement 
in all areas. The staff, students, and community believe the goal of education is to pro
duce citizens 
who will make a positive contribution to our society. We believe that all students can learn and 
succeed. We have high expectations and standards for our students in the area of academics. A 
knowledgeable, creative, and dedicated staff works 
effectively each day to provide a Standards
-
based instructional program to 450 students. All students from Transitional Kindergarten to fifth 
grade are the focus of all school programs.
 
 
At our school this year, our areas of focus are reading comprehension
, vocabulary development, 
math application, writing strategies, and increased use of technology for all students. As a team we 
continuously analyze data, and collaborate to ensure success for all our students. Standardized 
assessments assist us to make inf
ormed decisions about instruction through our State, District, and 
local measures. Our school is driven by a Standards
-
based curriculum that is set by guidelines 
created by the State of California. In addition, we utilize research
-
based strategies and prof
essional 
development to achieve our goals. Students of all abilities, from a variety of linguistic and 
socioeconomic levels, come together as a learning community at North Ranchito. The school 
community expects all students to achieve high standards as we 
have established in our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA).
 
 
Students approach their education with dedication and enthusiasm. Grades TK
-
5 students receive 
Trimester Awards where the top performing students are recognized in the areas of reading, m
ath, 
and citizenship. They are eager to receive these awards and challenge each other on the dynamic 
education derived from our Standards
-
based curriculum.
 
 
North Ranchito teachers are well qualified to handle the challenge of delivering a Common Core 
base
d education to a bright and diverse student body. Many teachers live in the community and 
are bilingual and bicultural. Emotionally invested in the school, they arrive early, work late, and 
serve in leadership roles. This is truly a testament to the tirele
ss work and efforts of our staff on 
the behalf of the students and families that they serve.
 
 
The School Site Council (SSC) and Parent
-
Teacher Organization (PTO) are very active on campus and 
meet regularly to discuss how to bolster student achievement and
 
school climate. As part of our 
technology goals and in an effort to promote parent participation, our parents will be offered the 
opportunity to participate in a series of workshops that focus on technology education and use of 
the Internet to support stu
dent academic goals.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). T
he SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), 
which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more infor
mation about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the

School Safety Plan
 
The School Safety Plan addresses all issues of staff and student safety, including plans for quick and orderly evacuations. T
he School Safety 
Plan outlines 
a communication system that allows the school community and local emergency services to mobilize a response to immediate conc
erns. North Ranchito 
employs two

way radios, a public address system, and a code of sirens to alert the school. Class
rooms are equipped with an emergency kit containing 
disaster supplies and a system of colored cards that alert the School Safety Committee to trapped or injured students or staf
f. The School Safety Plan was 
last reviewed, updated, and discussed with the sc
hool faculty and put into practice November 2019.
 
 
North Ranchito provides a safe, attractive campus that meets the needs of students and staff. Earthquake and fire drills are 
conducted regularly to 
prepare all students and staff for emergency situations. 
In order to ensure effective preparedness in case of an emergency, the staff reviews each drill 
and maintains disaster emergency supplies.

19 Analysis of data 
led to the identification of professional learning priorities. Whole group instruction, small group differentiated instructio
n, and 
designated English language development supported strengthening language arts instruction at the elementary level. Professio
nal learning in 
mathematics focused on the Standards for Mathematics Practice, in conjunction with problem
-
solving and modeling and data analysis at the middle 
school level. At the high school, professional learning was prioritized for the Expository Readi
ng and Writing Course which develops students' academic 
literacy in rhetorical and analytical reading, writing, and thinking. All schools participated in professional learning oppor
tunities centered on data literacy. 
Professional development is provided du
ring modified day schedules, pupil
-
free days, release days, and conferences/workshops outside the district. 
Professional learning is supported through in
-
class coaching, teacher
-
principal meetings, observations, and demonstration lessons.
