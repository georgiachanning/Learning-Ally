By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The community immediately surrounding Haman School is comprised of small single family homes and numerous 

which is f
requently active with athletic activities for all ages. Numerous modest small businesses are mixed into the 
residential neighborhood lending to the small town atmosphere. Our students come from a variety of home situations 
including single parent families,
 
children living with grandparents, foster homes, and extended families living together in 
the same home.
 
 
Haman School is a place where students become lifelong learners and develop the skills and strategies necessary to 
become contributing citizens. High
 
academic standards and a challenging curriculum are the foundations to student 
success. We work to develop a strong sense of community where students feel safe and appreciated for their individual 
differences. We value parents and the community as signifi
cant contributors to student success. We strive to enhance the

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
 
Santa Clara Unified School District (SCUSD) takes great e
fforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To 
assist in this effort, SCUSD uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California OPSC. The results of this
 

es department at (408) 423
-
2061.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
SCUSD 
maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in SCUSD, Board Policy 3514. The policy can be found 
online at www.santaclarausd.org/BoardPolicies. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to devel
op cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance
 
SCUSD participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program to assist school districts with expenditures for 
major repair or replacement of existing school building comp
onents. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
Modernization Projects
 
SCUSD strives to be a model of financial responsibility, making every effort to spe
nd taxpayer dollars wisely. At the same 
time, ongoing bond programs are necessary in a district this large, with so many students, teachers, and facilities needs. 
Bond funds allow the District to maintain safe, modern school facilities and bring in updated
 
technology essential to 
student achievement. Measure B 1997 improvements included new elementary school play structures, new high school 
science classrooms and outdoor athletic facilities, the major renovation of eleven elementary schools, an ambitious ro
of 
replacement program, and two high school performing arts buildings. Measure J 2004 generated funds to modernize 
buildings and classrooms for middle schools, high schools, and the adult education campus. Measure H 2010 upgraded 
fire, safety and security 
systems, renovated and reopened a closed elementary school, installed solar panels to decrease 
energy costs, purchased the Agnews campus property, and expanded overcrowded schools. Measure H 2014 funds 
construction of three new schools on the Agnews campus
, expands overcrowded schools, and addresses critical facility 
needs such as replacing roofs and adding air conditioning to elementary school classrooms. Measure BB 2018 funds the 
construction of three new schools, reconstructs fields, replaces aging play 
structures and playground paving, adds shade 
structures, and upgrades fencing and gates, among many other crucial projects. More: www.santaclarausd.org/bond
 
 
Age of School Buildings
 
The main campus of Haman School was built in 1952 and 1957. Portables were
 
added in 1997 for class size reduction and 
new classroom wings were constructed in 2004. This school has 28 classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library, and an 
administration building.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
All California public schools kindergarten and grades one through twelve must develop a comprehensive school safety 
plan, per California Education Code 
sections 32280
-
32289. School safety plans assess school climate and safety, identifying 
goals and actions to improve safety and climate. The safety plan is written and developed with collaboration from 
students, parents, community, and law enforcement. It 
is reviewed and updated annually with the School Site Council 
(SSC).
 
 
We are committed to providing a safe, responsible and respectful school environment for all students, staff, and 
community. We support and promote building a sense of community and belon
ging where every child feels included and 
valued, teaching children positive social skills and attitudes including resolving conflicts without violence, and preparing 
for and responding appropriately to emergencies and disasters to keep children safe.
 
 
The
 
school safety plan is available for review in the school office and was approved by the School Site Council in 2019.

Staff development activities and expenditures are tied to 
District and school goals including the SPSA, WASC, LCAP, and 
District Strategic Plan. Staff development time continues to support teachers in self
-
reflection, analysis of student 
achievement data, and collaboration activities designed to help reach achiev
ement goals. We believe in modeling lifelong 
learning for our students by engaging in collaborative sessions and professional development opportunities that align with 

School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) goals and support student achiev
ement in content standards and 
Expected Schoolwide Learning Results (ESLRs). District and school staff development programs support meeting the 
academic, social, and emotional needs of all students by providing opportunities for teachers to advance their s
kills, 
develop teaching strategies, and create curriculum. During staff in
-
service days, teachers share information about 
instructional practices, cognitive development and learning disabilities, and best practices for English Language Learners. 
These pres
entations and workshops help us understand who our students are so we can better support them with 
individual counseling, curriculum design, and instructional practices.
 
 
There are four days dedicated to professional development in the 2019
-
2020 school yea
r. There were five days of 
professional development in the 2018
-
2019 school year, eight days of professional development in the 2017
-
2018 school 
year, and eight days of professional development in the 2016
-
2017 school year. In addition, there is profession
al 
development happening on the school campus through professional learning communities, where teachers meet to 
discuss best practices while assessing student work.
