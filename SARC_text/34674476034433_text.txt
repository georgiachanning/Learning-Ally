By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019

MISSION STATEMENT
 
Carriage Elementary, a visual and performing arts school, in partnership with families and community, will ensure all 
children build a strong academic foundation that 
empowers them to become responsible 21st century citizens through a 
balanced and engaging curriculum.
 
 
SCHOOL PROFILE
 
Carriage Elementary is one of 41 elementary schools in the San Juan Unified School District.  Carriage Elementary is a 
kindergarten throug
h 5th grade school located in Citrus Heights, California serving approximately 500 students.  We at 
Carriage believe in an environment that promotes academic success and positive self
-
esteem while valuing individual 
differences.  Students are expected to b
e safe, be respectful, be responsible, and be good communicators with others.  
Through the use of positive reinforcement and consistent modeling, we are shaping our students into becoming model 
citizens.
 
 
We at Carriage believe that the administration, the
 
teachers, our parents, and the community must work together in order 
to complete our mission of academic excellence and model citizenship for students. Teachers are professionals who strive 
to be cooperative, flexible, communicative, and supportive. Paren
ts strive to create a supportive learning environment in 
the home. By working together with families and the community, we provide an atmosphere where students have an 
opportunity to develop to their fullest potential.
 
 
Our school programs are used to prov
ide academic growth, enrichment opportunities, and extension activities for our 
students and for their families. Art, music, and physical education are taught by specialists throughout the day. Each grade 
level organizes a musical production throughout the
 
school year. This gives the students an opportunity to demonstrate 
their academic and content knowledge through alternate expressive means. Bridges After
-
School is a program that 
provides homework assistance, recreation, technology experience, and learnin
g centers. Students who are designated as 
Gifted and Talented Education students (GATE) are given the benefit of an educational program designed to suit their 
capabilities and are encouraged to extend their learning beyond the grade level requirements. The
 
district offers parenting 
courses so parents are able to refine their parenting skills. These courses are available on the district website.
 
 
Carriage also provides programs to meet the needs of learners who require individualized educational plans. We have two 
Special Education Teachers with self
-
contained ASD classrooms, as well as two Resource Teachers, one full time and one 
half time, as wel
l as two full time Resource Instructional Assistants. We have one Inclusion Teacher who supports students 
who are fully mainstreamed with shared instructional assistant support.  The Special Education Department supplements 
the regular education program an

improve academics and develop character for all students.
 
 
Carriage has a population of English language learners speaking a variety of languages. Carriage has on staf
f a full time 
English Language Development Teacher who works with our English learners in small groups according to skill level. We 
place our English learners in general education classrooms where the teachers deliver differentiated instruction on a daily 
basis.

Carriage Drive Elementary was named a California Distinguished School in 2010.
 
 
Principal's Message
 
Carriage Elementary has a rich history of academic excellence, parent participation, and a visual and performing arts 
(VAPA) focus with an emphasis 
on STEAM
-
related activities.  STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math) 
education is embedded into many of the classroom lessons , all of which are characteristics of a dynamic and successful 
school.  I am absolutely delighted to be leading a
 
school team that is focused on teaching the whole child through a 
balanced and engaging curriculum, with an emphasis on student learning, collaboration, and commitment to high 
expectations for all students.
 
 
As Principal, it is my intent to support the ph
ilosophy of Carriage School as outlined in our strategic plan.  My goal is to 
sustain leadership that will help facilitate teaching and learning by providing opportunities for rigorous, rich learning, 
engagement in visual and performing arts activities, an
d integration of relevant technology in a vastly changing 21st 
century society.
 
 
It is a pleasure to be part of the nurturing school environment at Carriage, where the staff and parents are dedicated to 
providing an outstanding and enriching education for 
all students.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Kari Nichols, Principal

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September, 2019
 
 
San Juan 
Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018 and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of Cal
ifornia. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted
 
according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School B
oard by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the quality, cu
rrency, and availability of 
the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. If you would like more information 
on the textbooks and instructional materials please visit our website: http://www.sanjuan.edu/Page/23485 In
 
July 2009, 
EC Section 60200.7. The State Board of Education has adopted frameworks for ELA/ELD, Math, Science and Social 
Sciences, and has identified an approved list of instructional materials available for adoption. For more information

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent 
Year)
 
 
Carriage Drive Elementary School opened in 1986 and is one of the newer schools in the district. The site is evaluated 
yearly on the condition of the roofs, heating and air
-
conditioning system, paint, electrical infrastructure, window system 
leakage, and h
andicapped accessibility. Currently there is sufficient space to house the student population.  Site custodial 
staff clean the buildings along with district support for major/minor repairs.  The district provides gardening and landscape
 
services on a regul
ar schedule. Regular fire/emergency drills are held, and badges are required for all visitors and 
personnel. Field repair and irrigation system retrofit continue to be a concern. In 2005, under the Measure J Bond, new 
gas service was installed to support f
uture heating and air conditioning upgrades. Measure J replaced the roofing for the 
entire site in 2004.
 
 
The Board of Education and the Superintendent's policy is to ensure that all students are provided with a safe and well
-
maintained learning 
environment. The board approved resolutions in 1998 and 2002 to adequately fund maintenance 
activities and preserve the repairs and improvements funded by two facility bond measures. The school buildings, 
classrooms and grounds are safe, clean and function
al. An inspection of the facility was conducted in October 2019 and 
determined that there were no unsafe conditions that required emergency repairs. District maintenance staff ensures 
that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working
 
order are completed in a timely manner. A 
computer automated work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs and health and 
safety repairs are given the highest priority. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standa
rds and custodial staffing 
requirements for all schools in the district. This school meets the Board's standards for custodial staffing and cleanliness.
 
The school's custodians are trained in the proper use of cleaning chemicals and Integrated Pest Managem
ent techniques. 
They are managed day to day by the Principal with assistance from the district's maintenance department. The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, with funding allocated for major repair or replacement 
of e
xisting school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. Annually the district budgets $2 million dollars for deferred 
maintenance activ
ities.  In the summer of 2019, Carriage received updates to its campus.  There was updated air 
conditioning, painting, new flooring in the MP room, and new carpeting in all classrooms. All the sidewalks and parking 
lots are new within the last four years.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information 
relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general ed
ucation population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs
 
items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses tha
t satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

importance of reaching out to parents, to effectively communicate with them, and work with them as equal partners in 
their child's education.  Parents are 
informed of school activities and opportunities for volunteering at Carriage School in 
the welcome back letter from the school administrator in August and through weekly newsletters from the administrator 
and the classroom teacher.  Parents are also inform
ed of events through the use of the School Messenger system in various 
languages.  The school web site is maintained with the most up

1st of every year per the Education Code. As part of the update, this school meets at least once per year with a law 
enforcement officer to review the CSSP, has the local fire department review the CSSP and we hold a community 
meeting 
to review the CSSP. The CSSP must be approved by the School Site Council before being submitted to the district safe 

site specifi
c crisis response procedures and a district standardized emergency flip chart. This school conducts and keeps a 
record of all fire drills, lockdown drills, shelter in place drills and/or earthquake drills up to or in excess of what is re

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement

Professional development is a key part of the continuous improvement process for educators. The goal of our quality 
professional development is to support the learning of teachers and paraprofessionals to positively impact student 
achievement.  Annually, t
eachers and site administrators participate in professional development in a variety of 
opportunities.  Seventy
-
five minutes per week are dedicated to staff collaboration and training planned by site leadership 
teams. The District also provides a cycle of 
continuous professional development for Administrators through Principal 
Networks as well as Leadership Academies.
 
 
The District provides professional development opportunities for teachers and administrators that support the 
implementation of Common Core 
State Standards in English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and the 
ELA/ELD Framework.  Specific professional development initiatives include: Culturally Responsive Practices, Critical 
Literacy, TK
-
2 Reading, Supporting Independence and
 
Engagement through Reading and Writing, Math to the Core, 
Expository Reading and Writing Course, and ELD Foundations.  District departments, Center for Teacher Support, grant
-

ing opportunities.  Professional 
development opportunities are voluntary for teachers and are provided throughout the year in a variety of formats: during 
the school day, after school, on Saturdays, and during summer and vacation breaks. Many teachers and 
administrators 
also take advantage of opportunities with Sacramento County Office of Education, California Department of Education, 
the college/university programs, state/national education organizations, and private educational institutes.
 
 
What grounds t
he professional development in the district is the District Strategic Plan and the Local Control 
Accountability Plan. Professional Development is further determined using one or more of the following: (a) student 
achievement data, (b) staff survey data, an
d (c) district
-
identified goals.  Professional development addresses the Common 
Core State Standards, teaching strategies, curriculum, assessment, technology, classroom management, safety, and 
leadership. Administrator training accompanies professional dev
elopment in district focus areas, providing 
implementation support for teachers on site.  Content
-
area coaches are available at some schools.  Additional classroom 
support is provided to new and struggling teachers by consulting teachers from the Center fo
r Teacher Support.

Paraprofessionals are encouraged to participate in professional development at the district and site level.  Specifically 
designed training is also offered to non
-
instructional support staff such as clerical and custodial staff that inc
ludes both 
operational and instructional topics.
 
 
Professional Development for the 2018
-
19 school year has been training in Restorative Practices.  We saw in our student 
surveys that our students did not feel safe on campus or have an adult that they could
 
talk to, so the staff agreed to train 
all staff members, including recreation aides, teachers, and instructional aides for 2 days of pre
-
service work for 14 hours.  
Training will also continue throughout the school year during collaborative Thursdays and 
after school.
