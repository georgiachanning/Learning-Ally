Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
George Washington Elementary is a K
-
5 school located in Daly City. It is part of the Jefferson Elementary School District 
and has an enrollment of approximately 320 stud
ents. All of our teachers are fully credentialed and are teaching within 
their subject area of competence. Our school serves an ethnically diverse community that is reflected by our students, 
over 70 percent of whom come from homes where English is not the
 
first language. Our ultimate goal at George 
Washington is to help each student become a productive member of our school community and society at large.
 
 
Our school receives special funding from the federal government to assist in the development of readin
g and/or math 
skills for qualifying students through in our Title I program. We also receive a significant amount of funding in Local Contr
ol 
Funding Formula. A certificated teacher pulls small groups of English language learner students from kindergarten 
to fifth 
grade and assists them in English language development during Targeted Instructional Groups.  We are also able to better 
support our students with a full time counselor.  GW has hired a Garden Science teacher who works with students Monday 
through
 
Thursday in our outdoor garden.  Our after school program, ASES, includes a variety of structured activities (dance, 
STEM activities, science workshops, etc.).
 
 
All children can learn and deserve the highest quality education. George Washington Elementary
 
School is a collaborative 
community of learners where teachers, students, families, and the community grow and facilitate each child's journey to 
reach his or her potential and to become a life long
-
learner and thinker.
 
 
The SARC is available on the distr
ict website at www.jsd.k12.ca.us and can be made available in hard copy upon request.
 
Please contact the school at 650
-

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
School cleanliness standards are enforced district
 
wide. Inspections are conducted routinely. The district maintenance 
crew assures that all graffiti, broken windows and other types of vandalism are repaired immediately. Our school 
custodians and principal inspect the yard and buildings every day to ensur
e safety and cleanliness. Several years ago voters 
approved a 52 million
-
dollar bond to renovate district schools. A portion of these funds have gone toward upgrading our 
school's bathrooms, electrical wiring, Internet accessibility and will go to other bu
ilding and ground improvements.
 
 
Data reported are the determination of good repair as documented in a completed Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT) 
conducted every year. The most recent inspection was conducted in August 2018. Additional information about th
e 
condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by speaking with the school principal.
 
 
The school district has installed solar panels on the George Washington campus in the summer of 2014.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic
al education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety is a high priority at George Washington. We conduct monthly fire (evacuation) drills, quarterly earthquake 
(drop,cover, and hold on) drills, and biannual lockdown/barricade drills. The Daly City Fire Department conducts school 
assemblies every Octob
er to educate students about fire safety. Our school maintains a safety plan, which is updated 
annually, that includes information about all aspects of safety. A copy of the plan is available in the school office, along 
with a binder that holds information
 
about our ongoing program of chemical substance supervision consistent with State 
law. This is overseen by the JESD Director of Maintenance and Operation. There is a district facilitator who oversees the 
Disaster Preparedness Plan for the district. The di
strict maintains disaster supplies and equipment at all sites, including 
walkie
-
talkies with calling out capabilities. The school also has invested in additional walkie
-
talkies for key staff members, 
first aid supplies, n35 masks for students and staff and
 
a wheelchair.  We have food and water for 3 days for all students 
and staff, as well as first aid and emergency supplies.

small group of students meets with the classroom teacher) during UA to support the
m at their level. This position is also 
funded through our Supplemental and Concentration Grant funds.
 
 
We are also fortunate to be able to help fund a full time school counselor. Jefferson Elementary School District currently 
funds a half time counselor f
or each elementary school site. The George Washington community has decided to fund the 
other half, in order to ensure a full time counselor at our school site. Our school counselor helps to deliver programs such 
as Restorative Justice and Second Step less
ons. She also does classroom presentations on Digital Citizenship. In addition, 
she meets with students individually and in small groups to best address their behavioral, social, and academic needs.
