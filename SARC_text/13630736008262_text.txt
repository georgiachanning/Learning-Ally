Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 2019
 
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 24, 2019 and on December 10, 2019, and determined that each 
school within the district had su
fficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment 
pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English Learners, are given their
 
own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks 
or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California 
Department of Education, making the textbooks used in the sc
hool the most current available. Materials approved for use 
by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the school Board by a selection committee 
composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available
 
for parent examination at the district 
office prior to adoption.
 
 
The table displays information collected in September 2019 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Brawley Elementary School District established a detailed disaster plan for each of its schools in the event of emergencies. 
The plan clearly explains specific duties and responsibilities for al
l levels of staff and site personnel, including aides, 
custodians, health services personnel, cafeteria staff, and the librarian, and is designed to ensure student and staff safety
 
during a disaster. The Comprehensive Safety Plan was developed by the distr
ict in consultation with local law enforcement 
in order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997. The plan is updated and amended annually by the School Site Council in 
order to ensure that it is properly implemented. An updated copy of the plan is available
 
to the public at the district office.
 
 
The Safety Plan was designed to assist in preparing for emergencies, managing emergency response efforts, and 
maintaining a safe school environment. The plan requires identification of security needs, 
development of prevention and 
intervention techniques, evaluation of physical facilities, and communication with staff and students. Components of the 
Comprehensive Safety Plan include child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pup
il procedures, 
disaster response procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress from school, the sexual harassment policy, the dress 
code, and procedures related to the compliance of existing laws as they affect school safety.
