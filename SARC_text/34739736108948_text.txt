Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):

through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternat
e achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for e
ntrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
The North Country Safe School and Emergency Preparedness Plan is updated annually with our current version  approved 
in January 2019.  The Safe School plan is reviewed with faculty at the beginning of each school year.
 
 
The Emergency 
Response Plan has as its primary objectives:
 
 
1.
 
To save lives and avoid injuries;
 
2.
 
To safeguard school property and records;
 
3.
 
To promote a fast, effective reaction to coping with emergencies;
 
4.
 
To restore conditions back to normal with minimal confusion as promp
tly as possible.
 
 
Attaining these objectives will require clear activation procedures and responsibilities, identification of all tasks to be 
performed and by whom, an organized yet flexible response, and the dedication and cooperation of all.
 
 
It is vital
 
to the continued functioning of the school, staff, and students that we are prepared to respond effectively in 
times of emergencies.  Such preparations will also help us meet our obligations to our community.
 
 
This plan has been developed  in accordance t
o district guidelines to be used in case of an emergency.  All members of the 
faculty and other employees should:
 
 
1.
 
Familiarize themselves with this plan,
 
2.
 
Be prepared to activate it immediately, and
 
3.
 
Perform any duties to which they are assigned to make its 
activation effective.
 
4.
 
Participate in annual district "disaster drill."
 
 
 
Members of the faculty shall teach the appropriate sections of the  Emergency Response Plan to the students.  The 
members of each classroom shall be instructed in the evacuation plan 
so they can respond immediately upon receiving 
the necessary warning.
