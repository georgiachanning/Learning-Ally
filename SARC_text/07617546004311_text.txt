Description
 
and
 
Mission
 
Statement
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
Our
 
mission
 
at
 
Strandwood
 
Elementary
 
is
 
to
 
inspire
 
academic
 
excellence,
 
personal
 
growth
 
and
 
responsibility
 
while
 
encouraging
 
each
 
individual
 
to
 
reach
 
their
 
full
 
potential
 
and
 
discover
 
the
 
lasting
 
joy
 
of
 
learning.
 
 
Children
 
thrive
 
at
 
Strandwood
 
Elementary
 
because
 
they
 
are
 
honored
 
and
 
supported
 
by
 
both
 
their
 
teachers
 
and
 
community.
 
On
 
school
 
spirit
 
days,
 
you
 
will
 
see
 
an
 
ocean
 
of
 
blue
 
and
 
gold-dressed
 
children
 
and
 
staff
 
members
 
proudly
 
displaying
 
our
 
school
 
colors.
 
Students
 
feel
 
a
 
great
 
sense
 
of
 
being
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
something
 
good
 
and
 
this
 
pride
 
fuels
 
their
 
motivation
 
to
 
do
 
their
 
best
 
and
 
also
 
inspires
 
them
 
to
 
keep
 
their
 
dreams
 
big
 
and
 
their
 
hopes
 
high.
 
Students,
 
staff
 
members
 
and
 
parents
 
work
 
hand-in-hand
 
at
 
our
 
school
 
to
 
support
 
each
 
other™s
 
evolution.
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
synergy
 
created
 
when
 
teachers
 
help
 
students,
 
the
 
community
 
supports
 
teachers,
 
and
 
we
 
all
 
agree
 
that
 
a
 
high-quality
 
education
 
is
 
priceless.
 
Our
 
success
 
proves
 
that
 
when
 
we
 
work
 
together
 
for
 
the
 
good
 
of
 
children,
 
we
 
can
 
achieve
 
great
 
things.
 
 
We
 
have
 
also
 
learned
 
at
 
Strandwood
 
that
 
successful
 
teachers
 
consistently
 
create
 
educational
 
journeys
 
that
 
allow
 
all
 
students
 
to
 
excel
 
in
 
the
 
classroom
 
regardless
 
of
 
their
 
current
 
levels
 
of
 
performance.
 
We
 
know
 
that
 
meaningful
 
classroom
 
environments
 
promote
 
deep
 
understanding
 
and
 
we
 
foster
 
unique
 
experiences
 
and
 
enriched
 
outcomes.
 
Teachers
 
personalize
 
standardized
 
methodologies
 
and
 
give
 
children
 
the
 
time
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
learn
 
about
 
themselves
 
and
 
the
 
world
 
around
 
them.
 
We
 
also
 
know
 
that
 
collaboration
 
leads
 
to
 
empowerment
 
and
 
is
 
best
 
cultured
 
in
 
a
 
creative
 
environment
 
that
 
is
 
grounded
 
in
 
the
 
belief
 
that
 
everyone
 
can
 
succeed.
 
At
 
Strandwood,
 
we
 
believe
 
in
 
bringing
 
out
 
the
 
best
 
in
 
each
 
other.
 
We
 
believe
 
that
 
every
 
child
 
matters.

our
 
keys
 
to
 
academic
 
success.
 
Strandwood
 
has
 
an

essential

Our

such
 
as
 
our

At
 
Strandwood
 
Elementary,
 
we
 
agree
 
that
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
encourage
 
our
 
students
 
to
 
be
 
lifelong
 
learners,
 
we
 
must
 
inspire
 
each
 
other
 
to
 
grow
 
as
 
educators.
 
United
 
into
 
a
 
professional
 
learning
 
community
 
(PLC),
 
we
 
believe
 
that
 
together
 
we
 
are
 
more.
 
W
 
e
 
meet
 
regularly
 
as
 
a
 
staff
 
and
 
as
 
grade
 
level
 
teams
 
to
 
openly
 
share
 
and
 
discuss
 
what
 
strategies
 
drive
 
improvement
 
and
 
what
 
beliefs
 
limit
 
potential.
 
Our
 
decisions
 
are
 
data-driven
 
and
 
grounded
 
in
 
best
 
practices.
 
Student
 
achievement
 
data
 
is
 
regularly
 
disaggregated
 
and
 
examined
 
through
 
various
 
lenses.
 
Scores
 
are
 
compared
 
between
 
teachers
 
and
 
grade
 
levels,
 
and
 
contrasted
 
with
 
similar
 
schools
 
locally,
 
nationally,
 
and
 
internationally.
 
We
 
also
 
monitor
 
our
 
at-risk
 
populations
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
they
 
have
 
the
 
support
 
they
 
need.
 
Finally,
 
student
 
achievement
 
data
 
is
 
then
 
aggregated
 
and
 
we
 
look
 
for
 
trends
 
and
 
outliers.
 
 
Our
 
district
 
supports
 
our
 
work
 
by
 
offering
 
relevant
 
professional
 
development
 
opportunities
 
for
 
teachers
 
and
 
administrators.
 
Recent
 
trainings
 
include
 
cycles
 
of
 
continuous
 
improvement,
 
equity
 
tools,
 
summative
 
assessments,
 
Engage
 
New
 
York,
 
Wonders,
 
and
 
a
 
multitude
 
of
 
technology
 
classes.
 
This
 
year's
 
focus
 
is
 
the
 
ongoing
 
implementation
 
of
 
priority
 
ELA
 
and
 
math
 
CCSS
 
math
 
standards,
 
equity
 
guidelines
 
and
 
measurement
 
tools,
 
anti-bullying
 
tenets
 
and
 
a
 
deep
 
commitment
 
to
 
success
 
for
 
all
 
students.
 
MDUSD
 
has
 
sponsored
 
conferences
 
and
 
workshops
 
and
 
we
 
have
 
also
 
used
 
on-site
 
staff
 
trainings
 
to
 
help
 
teachers
 
prioritize
 
equitable
 
access
 
for
 
all
 
students
 
and
 
deepen
 
student
 
understanding.
 
Similar
 
to
 
professional
 
development
 
opportunities
 
from
 
2015-2019,
 
the
 
district
 
will
 
provide
 
three
 
full
 
days
 
of
 
training
 
for
 
our
 
teachers
 
in
 
2019-
2020.
 
In
 
addition,
 
district
 
coaches
 
(TOSAs)
 
have
 
also
 
provided
 
individual
 
mentoring
 
and
 
influential
 
modeling
 
as
 
they
 
continue
 
to
 
encourage
 
us
 
to
 
go
 
deeper
 
and
 
think
 
bigger.
 
 
At
 
our
 
school
 
site,
 
instructional
 
rounds
 
and
 
teacher-principal
 
meetings
 
are
 
used
 
to
 
align
 
and
 
refine
 
pedagogical
 
practices
 
and
 
to
 
help
 
us
 
meet
 
rigorous
 
Common
 
Core
 
State
 
Standards.
 
In
 
addition,
 
we
 
consistently
 
provide
 
collaboration
 
time
 
for
 
teachers
 
and
 
ask
 
grade
 
level
 
teams
 
to
 
unpack
 
key
 
elements
 
in
 
learning
 
and
 
study
 
exemplar
 
lessons
 
from
 
each
 
other
 
and
 
teachers
 
around
 
the
 
world.
 
We
 
share
 
what
 
we
 
know
 
and
 
we
 
love
 
what
 
we
 
do.
 
We
 
also
 
consistently
 
remind
 
each
 
other
 
that
 
we
 
believe
 
in
 
success
 
for
 
all
 
students.
