By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

s our staff to engage in the process of analyzing student learning data in order to implement effective research
-
proven instructional practices. We have a fully equipped
 
computer lab and many mobile devices so that every student has more

data, their productivity and their creativity.
 
 
 
Our Olinda families and staff share a common vision to create a community of life
-
long learner

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Located in the city of Brea, Olinda Elementary School is a public school, which currently serves over 700 students in Pre 
School, Transitional Kindergarten, Kindergarten and grades one through six. Before December 
2011, the school was 
located in a pastoral setting approximately five miles from the center of Brea off Carbon Canyon Road. 
 
In January 2012, 
the school was relocated to a new facility on Birch Street adjacent to the Brea Sports Park. Our new facility is s
urrounded 
by rolling hills and single
-
family homes. 
 
The school facility includes sufficient classroom space to meet the needs of our 
growing student enrollment. The playground provides ample play areas for students for both recess and physical 
education i
nstruction.
 
 
 
Age of School Buildings:
 
 
The present Olinda facility was built in 2011 and is comprised of 27 classrooms, a media center (library/computer). In 
September, 2018,
 
 
our state of the art multipurpose room was competed. It contains food services 
and a back stage band 
classroom.
 
 
The main administration building housed the staff workroom, the health office, the principal's office and our 
staff lounge. 
 
 
 
Maintenance and Repair:
 
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operati
ons. District maintenance supervisors are 
proactive and conduct inspections at school sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure
 
efficient service and that 
emergency repairs are given the highest priority. As of January 2018, none of the eight emergency conditions cited in 
Education Code 17592.72 exist at Olinda. Current Facilities Inspection was completed in January 2019.
 
 
Cleanin
g Process and Schedule:
 
 
The principal works with the custodial staff to develop a cleaning schedule that ensures a clean and safe school. In 
addition, the District maintenance staff makes any repairs necessary to keep the school in exemplary working order
.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

All curriculum development by Olinda Elementary School and the Brea Olinda Unified School District is aligned to the 

School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement. At the Dis
trict level, a team of administrators specializing in curriculum and instruction identifies where 
students are not meeting grade level standards and develops a plan to increase student achievement in identified areas. 
After District goals and expectations 
are set, the District team reaches out to schools through needs assessment surveys 
regarding individual school needs and priorities. Using results from the surveys, combined with data analysis from various 
assessments, the District team collaborates with s
chool site leaders to develop a Professional Development Plan that is 
implemented at all schools.
 
 
In addition to the District's Professional Development Plan, Olinda Elementary School develops its own plan for 
professional development activities focused o
n increasing student achievement and improving classroom instruction 
based on school and district instructional goals.
 
 
 
During the 2014
-
19 school years, District specialists and school leadership teams reviewed and updated achievement plans 
using student assessment data (State testing and District assessment results) and survey responses. Findings were used 
to design profes
sional development workshops for district
-
wide Professional Development days and supplemental school
-
level activities. One mandatory District staff development day and one school site staff development day were held in 
addition to District and school
-
spons
ored professional development activities and workshops.
 
 
Olinda Elementary School's staff participated in the following professional development activities during 2014
-
