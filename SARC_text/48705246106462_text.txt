School Description
 
The teachers, staff and parents of Joe Henderson Elementary School believe their primary objective 
is to the development of well
-
rounded children with an active interest in learning, intellectual 
exploration, and social involvement. The school's intention 
is to create an environment where each 
child is encouraged and supported in reaching their highest potential as individuals, while 
interacting, contributing to, and embracing their community of student peers. The school prepares 
children for future challen
ges in academics and in their social environments. The school places 
great emphasis on developing and modeling exemplary habits of study and intellectual discovery, 
good citizenship and positive character traits supported by our community. As educators, we
 
also 
recognize the value of both practical application of knowledge, and the necessity of monitoring 
progress through testing and other evaluative methods to ensure the challenges of academic 
growth are being met successfully by each individual student. I
t is through these values and actions, 
that we at Joe Henderson Elementary School intend to shape our community's children into self
-
confident, self
-
knowledgeable young people with promising futures in their academic careers, as 
well as their chosen fields
 
of endeavor outside of school.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.
