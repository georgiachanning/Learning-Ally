School Description
 
Cobblestone Elementary School is committed to academic excellence encompassing high
 
standards, developing confident learners, and building positive communication and citizenship for 
the entire Plumas Lake community. Cobblestone Elementary School serves Transitional 
Kindergarten through 5th grade students providing a
 
comprehensive educati
onal experience for 
every child. Our ongoing goal that all students develop skills to allow them think critically and 
ultimately be proficient in ELA  and Math. Our long term goal is for all students to love learning and 
develop 
lifelong
 
learning behaviors
. Our daily schedule is designed to support our most intensive 
need students and to allow Education Specialists the opportunity to best meet the needs of 
students.
 
 
All students receive weekly instruction from our Physical Education Specialist and visual a
nd 
performing arts from the Music and Art teacher. Students are assessed using diagnostic 
assessments and are clustered during our Enrichment/Intervention Instructional Block for an 
average of 280 minutes weekly. Mondays are scheduled as early release days
, where teachers and 
support staff are provided professional development and collaborative planning time to identify 
and plan for specific learning goals in district and site designated areas. Each grade level develops 
Project Based Learning opportunities 
so each student participates in at least one project per year.  
Our daily schedule is designed to give grade levels and specialists time to support PBL projects.
 
 
Our Physical Education Specialist, Art and Music teachers provide after school enrichment 
opp
ortunities for students throughout the year. Additionally, credentialed teachers use diagnostic 
and summative data to determine after school academic supports for strategic students.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the 
SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see t
he CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

In the 2007
-
2
008 school year we opened our third new school in the Plumas Lake area: Cobblestone Elementary.  We are proud of our Plumas L
ake ESD 
campuses and strive to keep our schools in good repair so they are clean, safe, functional, and provide an orderly environm
ent for teaching and learning.  
Cobblestone is a new school in excellent condition.  Two custodians clean the school on a daily basis.  Staggering shifts all
ows us to have one custodian 
during the school day, and two part time custodians in the evening ( a
fter school hours).  There are 15 regular classrooms, a science lab, a library, a 
computer lab, an art lab, a multipurpose room, and three Special Education rooms.  The design capacity of the school is 605 s
tudents.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
