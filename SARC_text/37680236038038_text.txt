About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca

possible for our students. Parents are encouraged to support their children's academic development from home and we stand rea

School Safety Plan
 
Student safety and well
-
being is promoted through ongoing discussion and awareness activities. Some of these activities include emergency and 
earthquake preparedness drills, monthly fire dril
ls, bus evacuation drills, school
-
wide assemblies, adequate playground supervision, and professional 
development for staff on child abuse awareness & reporting, and hygiene and emergency procedures. We use a systematic check
-
in system for adults 
on campus 
in between arrival and dismissal times. We have an active and well
-
trained Safety Patrol. Additionally we incorporate Red Ribbon Week, which 
focuses on drug and alcohol abuse prevention. Our school is a No Place For Hate school and as such we use the pledg
e & other related activities school 
wide. Our school emphasizes positive behavior supports through a school
-
wide Gotcha program that "catches" students doing the "right" things and 
then recognizes students for their good choices on a weekly basis. Class Go
tcha slips are also handed out for classroom group behavior recognition. We 
promote the development of a Growth Mindset throughout the school year, but focus on particular Viking Principles and charact
er traits for 5 to 6 weeks 
at a time school
-
wide. Those
 
traits and/or skills are modeled and discussed more explicitly during those specified weeks and are used to recognize model 
students at student awards assemblies. All students attend assemblies that promote positive behaviors and dispositions at the
 
start
 
of each quarter. We 
adhere to our district's wellness policy and promote healthy living through physical activity and informed food choices.
 
Student safety is of the utmost importance and priority at Valley Vista. A school site advisory committee composed
 
of parents and staff members review 
and revise the previous year's School Safety Plan in the first quarter of the school year. Data from annual parent, student, 
and staff surveys on school 
climate and any crime reported is also reviewed and incorporated. 
A law enforcement officer and our fire department review the Safe School Plan final 

plan was approved by 
our SSC in December of 201

program.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to add
ress particular, identified 
learning gaps. Students use adaptive, web

Valley Vista has invested in a data and assessment management system (Illuminateed) and continues to update and purchase more
 
computers and other 
technology tools for teaching such as laptops, document cameras, LCD projectors, and Smart 
TVs in order to provide our students and teachers with the 
technology know
-
how that is increasingly necessary in our society.
