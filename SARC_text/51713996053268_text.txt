About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in 
California is required by state 
law to pu
blish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educatio
nal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepa
re a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, d
ata reported in an LCAP is to be 
consiste
nt with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.g
ov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information 
about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school princi
pal or the 
district office.

PP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through ei
ght and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant
 
cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of

Encinal Elementary School benefits from an extremely active Parents' Club that raises funds 
to support student activities.  Parent's club hosted numerous 
fundraisers such as selling Jamba Juice  discount cards, holding their 60th annual spaghetti di
nner, and hosted both a Back to School Night and Open 
House BBQ.  Parents are encouraged to become 
involved in School Site Council and attend their students school activities.  A continuous partnership 
with staff and parents occurs to support the education
al opportunities for students at Encinal School.  Parents are encouraged to become involved in 
thei
r students classroom.  Parent volunteers help out with a variety of things, such as working in the classroom, helping with fi
eld trips, and taking work 
home.
  
Volunteers are encouraged to contact their students teacher or the principal if they'd like to vo

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
P

Other local measures on the sense o
f safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The School Site Safety Plan has been developed by the Safety Committee, which consists of three vice principals, one principa
l, the fire chief, and local 
law 
enforcement.  The committee meets regularly to set long term goals f
or the school as well as assisting in upgrading the school facilities.  The Safety 
Plan is updated each spring and covers various safety procedures including student injury and emergency p
rocedures. Safety drills are held on a regularly 
basis, fire drills 
are held monthly; earthquake/disaster drills are held twice a year.  Supervision is a shared responsibility between teachers,
 
instructional 
aides, and administration.  To enhance communica
tion on campus while out supervising students we use two way radios.
  
Security cameras were installed 
during the winter of 2019, on the outside of the school buildings.
 
 
Encinal is a closed campus and all visitors must sign in and out at the main office.  
Parents/Guardians are always welcome at Encinal.  All visitors are 
r
equired to report to the office and receive a visitor's pass prior to visiting the campus and classrooms.  Visitors are expec
ted to follow school rules.

Encinal Elementary School staff members strengthen their instruction
al practice on an ongoing basis through participation in ongoing collaboration at 
professional learning community meetings and through district and site sponsored professional development 
sessions. Topics for staff development 
during the school year includ
ed: data analysis and collaboration, effective teaching practices, implementation of the adopted English Language Arts, 
Math and English Language Development curriculum, implementation of 
the Common core Standards, effective instructional practices to maxi
mize 
student engagement (Districts 5 Key Instructional Principles), and Response to Intervention support. The district has identif
ied 5 key instructional 
practices to implement across the 
district.  The instructional principles are the following: 1. Identi
fying and sharing the learning objective, 2. 50/50 where 
students are engaged in discussion and doing the talking at least 50% of the time. 3. Push, where students are pushed out of 
their 
comfort zone. 4. 
Complete sentences, all students speak and write in
 
complete sentences. 5. Error Corrections, in which all errors are corrected to allow for students to 
learn the content correctly.  Our site also participates in on site and off site PD th
at focuses in on AVID strategies.  Encinal has been implementing AVI
