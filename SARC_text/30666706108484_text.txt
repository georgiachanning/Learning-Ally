School Description
 
James A. Garfield Elementary School (Garfield Elementary) is located on Brown Street, southeast 
of Santa Ana Boulevard in the "Station District." Garfield Elementary is comprised of TK through 
5th grade as well as hosting two State presc

Garfield is a community of learners preparing its students for college, career, citizenship, and 
success in the 21st Century. In o
rder to increase critical thinking skills, we embed AVID 
systematically in all 2nd
-
5th grade classrooms throughout the day and utilize Thinking Maps to help 
students visualize their thinking, participate orally, and in writing. Developing key foundational 
skills in English Language Arts (ELA), English Language Development (ELD) and Math, are key in 
striving to meet this goal. In order to propel all students to read on grade level by third grade, one 
of our primary foci is on early literacy skills integrated
 
with blended and personalized learning. 
Utilizing both the ELA and ELD Frameworks, in conjunction with Benchmark Advance, our English 
Learners (ELs) are supported throughout the day with both designated ELD and integrated ELD.  
This will help us achieve o
ur goal of all EL students to be reclassified as English proficient within 5 
years. In mathematics, in order to ensure that all student are algebra ready, we are implementing 
Math Expressions. This State adopted program embeds all of the eight mathematical
 
practices 
found in our Common Core State Standards (CCSS). In science, we are utilizing practices found in

have been trained in Project Lead the Way (PLTW) and 
in the Next Generation Science Standards 
(NGSS) and all grade levels are implementing at least one Project Based Learning (PBL) unit.

to participate on the Speech and Debate Team, Math Team, National History Day, Student Council, 
and Playworks after school sports.  Our Gators are taug
ht to be safe, respectful, and responsible 
through the implementation of the Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) 
framework and Restorative Practices. We pride ourselves on being recognized as a Platinum PBIS 
school. We are dedicated to de

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
dist
rict office.

maintained and kept 
safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. Maintenance and O
perations (M&O) employs an electronic work order system enabling school staff 
to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Most of the school's repairs and maintenan
ce projects are 

alified, professional trade specialists. Emergency situations are immediately resolved either by the school custodian 
or district maintenance staff, based upon the nature of the situation. Day and evening custodians work closely as a team and 
with the prin
cipal for routine 
maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events preparations. The principal and day custodian communicate daily to di
scuss campus cleaning 
needs and safety concerns. Every morning before school begins, the custodian and principal 
inspect facilities for safety hazards, graffiti, and other 
conditions that require removal prior to students and staff entering school grounds. School safety and cleanliness are the cu

strongly emphasized as a component of the

chemicals, and use of equipment. The day custodians are responsible for following an established set of cleaning standards an
d prioritization procedures
 
for general campus maintenance. The day custodian checks restrooms twice a day as a proactive measure in keeping facilities w
ell stocked, safe, and 
sanitary. The evening custodians are responsible for thorough cleaning of classrooms, office areas, and res
trooms. Groundskeepers are dispatched by 
the district office to perform general maintenance of landscaping, gardening, sports fields, and irrigation systems.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
