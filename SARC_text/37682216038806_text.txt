California has adopted the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). These standards have also been adopted by other states through
out 
the United States bringing a consistency to teaching and 
learning as well as instruction and expectations for students throughout the 
United States. Due to the adoption of the Common Core State Standards, our instructional practices have changed as we have ma
de the 
transition from the California State Standards 
to the Common Core State Standards. In National School District and at Olivewood School, 
we are continuing our implementation of the Common Core State Standards. School staff has and will continue to participate in
 
staff 



ollege and 
career ready when they gra
duate from high school.
 
 
Parents are an invaluable resource to our school and our students. We know that parent involvement is a strong predictor of a
 


arents and/or guardians. It is vitally 

l program is 
offered to our students and that we work together to assist our students and ou
r school to fully meet the needs of our students.
 
 
This School Accountability Report Card presents a variety of information about our school that we hope you find informative a
nd 
interesting. We acknowledge that everyone who contributes to our school 
makes a difference in the lives of our students. With the support 
of our parents, community and the District we are able to offer our students an instructional program that allows them a wide
 
variety of 
opportunities to progress academically and to reach t
heir fullest potential. We hope that the information included in this report will assist 

ience 
each and every student at Olivewood 
School.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about 
the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educ
ational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or t
he district office.

Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emer
gency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
We have made a conscientious effort to provide a clean and attractive campus. Students are encouraged to have pride in their 
school and keep the 
campus clean. The District Governi
ng Board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at 
the school office or at the district maintenance office. The principal works daily with the custodial staff and the custodial
 
supervisor t
o develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
The Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT)
 
The FIT is used on a yearly basis to identify facility needs and repairs.  All items found in need of repair on the FIT are a
ddressed.  Items that involve
 
asphalt, roofing, flooring or painting are addressed through the District's deferred maintenance program.  All other items ar
e expedited into the National 
School District work order system and repaired by our maintenance department.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

Olivewood School is 
determined to give students the highest quality education possible. In order to meet students needs, we believe that professi
onal 
development is an important educational component. At our school site we are primarily focused in two areas, Language Arts an
d
 
Mathematics. This is 
a decision derived by our school data and student needs. Educators learn best practices in these fields in various ways. Prof
essional learning communities, 
workshops, conferences, and lesson studies are some of the ways that Olivewood
 
teachers excel in their learning and teaching.
 
 
Teachers are supported continuously. During implementation, the principal is in classrooms daily observing and providing valu
able feedback. The school 
has a leadership team that also provides ideas such as l
esson studies, coaching, and walkthroughs to learn from each other. Data teams meet every other 
weeks and reflections are done on student progress. Teachers reflect on what is working, what needs refining, and next steps.
 
Classroom educators also 
have cons
tant communication with our Language Arts Specialist who is an expert in her field and she provides coaching, suggestions, co
-
teaching, and 
facilitating of professional development.
 
 
In addition, the National School District calendar earmarks full days and
 
early release time for providing site
-
based professional development for all 
teachers. The District also assists in the coordination of BTSA Induction Support for year one and two teachers. Teachers who
 
are experiencing difficultly 
or need improvement hav
e access to the PAR (Peer Assistance Review) Program.
