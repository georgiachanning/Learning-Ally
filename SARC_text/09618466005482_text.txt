By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Camino Elementary School is a California and National Title 1 Distinguished School, in the Camino Union School District. 
Camino School is nestled amongst 
the "Apple Hill" Ranches, 7 miles east of Placerville in El Dorado County. In the 
community of Camino, industry is largely agriculture and forestry based, but there is also a large representation of 
professionals, retirees, and those that choose to commute
 
west toward the Sacramento area. The students of Camino 
School are a diverse mix of families, including a wide range of socioeconomic groups, and a strong Hispanic population 
representation. The school is well supported by an incredible Parent Teacher Org
anization, the Camino Community Action 
Committee, El Dorado County Ag in the Classroom, the Apple Hill Growers Association, El Dorado Winery Association, the 
Camino/Pollock Pines Rotary and other groups. Camino families tend to love the outdoors and apprec
iate a rural lifestyle, 
while still enjoying easy access to the urban and suburban conveniences.
 
 
Our school provides a very strong California State standards
-
based curriculum, and has fully implemented the new 
California Assessment of Student Performance 
and Progress (CAASPP) testing system. Along with our talented and highly 
qualified classroom teachers, we have highly skilled resource teachers to provide specialized instruction in computers, 
GATE, English language immersion, physical education, and speci
al education. Camino has wonderful support staff 
throughout the campus, always striving to take care of our Camino family. All classrooms have computers and/or 
Chromebooks with access to the Internet. Camino students have access to a variety of computer an
d internet based 
supplemental programs tailored to support elementary and middle school students. School and district plans incorporate 
strategies to maintain our current technology, while still planning for access to new technology. The school district 
ma
intains a helpful and informative website at: www.caminoschool.org. and communicates regularly through auto
-
calling 
systems and school newsletters.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Year and month in which 
data were collected:
 
October 2019
 
 
Camino Union Elementary held a public hearing on October 8, 2019, and determined that the school had sufficient and 
good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of W
illiams vs. the 
State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or 
instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and supplem
entary 
materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making the textbooks 
used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a 
recommenda
tion is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All 
recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. The table displays 
information collected in October,
 
2019 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks 
and other instructional materials used at the school.
 
 
All students are expected to meet the Camino School Technology standards. Technology standards are taught in 
conju
nction with the instructional program in classrooms. We provide a 32
-
seat computer lab which is staffed by a full
-
time computer teacher providing instruction and support in basic core academic programs, digital citizenship, computer 
literacy, keyboarding, 
word processing and spreadsheet skills. Every classroom, the library, and all offices are connected 
into a wide
-
area network with access to the Internet and electronic mail. We also have a second computer lab with 30 
computers where teachers have the oppor
tunity to bring their entire class for projects and instruction. The Middle School 
part of campus has full access to Chromebooks as needed.  Also older student computers in the regular classrooms have 
been replaced by Chrome book mini
-
labs. There are at le
ast five computers/chromebooks/tablets in every classroom 
connected to the network. The school is developing Chromebook/Tablet mini
-
labs in all classrooms as well. Camino 
students and their parents must sign an internet use agreement prior to utilizing com
puters on the campus or their Google 
accounts. Internet filtering is provided to greatly reduce the risk of inappropriate content. The District technology vision 
is that curriculum must meet state testing and accountability standards and all student softwa
re for academics must be 
adaptive for long term individualized growth.
 
 
In 2019, the library collection consists of over 10,000 fiction and nonfiction books.  The Library Plan, as part of the Site 
Council developed Site Plan, includes plans for multiple me
diums available through the library. Through the allocation of 
general funds, Parent Teacher Organization support, book fairs, and grants, we have been investing heavily and building 
our collection. In addition, our library provides access to research soft
ware, Chromebooks and the Internet. Benchmark 
leveled text kits were added to the library for teacher access. Staffed by a library clerk, the library is available to all 
classroom teachers and students.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Camino School is located on a beautiful 40
-
acre site in a 
mixed conifer forest at the 3,200
-
foot elevation. Camino 
Elementary was originally constructed in 1952 and is comprised of 25 classrooms, 1 gym, 1 multipurpose room/cafeteria, 
1 library, 1 staff lounge, 3 computer labs, and 2 playgrounds.  Camino School bo
asts large athletic fields, a school garden, 
an amazing nature trail and many other amenities not offered by other schools. The County Office of Education also 
operates Regional Special Education programs and State Pre
-
School in the Winnie Wakely building 
on our campus. All 
classroom spaces are utilized to their fullest extent. The facilities enable the school to provide plenty of space for all 
educational programs including regular classrooms, library, special education, Title I, English Learner resource p
rogram, 
after
-
school enrichment and extension programs, and staff rooms. While most of the facility was built in the early 1950's, 
regular maintenance and some modernization has kept rest rooms, flooring, walls, roofs, plumbing and electrical systems 
in ad
equate service. However, it is requiring a greater effort every year to keep our facilities adequate. The District is 
working hard to secure funds from a variety of sources to upgrade and replace our aging facility infrastructure. The Camino 
Community pass
ed "Measure H" in June 2016, to fix and replace aging infrastructure throughout our campus, and 
specifically to replace the Elementary School student bathrooms and parking area. The "Measure H" projects reached 
completion in the end of 2018.
 
 
The administr
ation and maintenance staff are committed to maintaining a safe environment that is conducive to learning. 
Vandalism and graffiti are immediately addressed before students and staff are aware. Staff collects garbage and cleans 
the campus daily. Students ar
e involved in campus beautification and cleanup efforts. Community volunteers, our Charter 
School, and an active agriculture/garden program regularly improve our campus environment. Cleaning Process: The 
principal works daily with the custodial/maintenance
 
staff of 3 full
-
time employees to ensure that the cleaning of the 
school is maintained to provide for a clean and safe school. Student restrooms are regularly cleaned twice a day, and 
whenever circumstances require more cleaning. The district governing bo
ard has adopted cleaning standards for all 
schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the district office for review.

Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in ade
quate repair and work orders are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest priority are given to 
emergency repairs. While reviewing this report, please note that even minor discrepancies are reported
 
in the inspection 
process. School stakeholders work hard to maintain a comprehensive Master Facility Plan. The plan contains a priority list 
of projects to be completed as funding permits. The MFP is posted on the school district web site for review.

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Camino Union School District has a comprehensive safety plan in place. An Emergency Operations Plan is shared with 
emergency agencies and includes maps and instructions for all systems as well as a summary of all safety related poli
cies. 
This plan was updated in August of 2018.  Each classroom has an Emergency Clipboard, updated each year, with 
emergency contacts and procedures. The District/School Management Team meets weekly, addressing all safety issues.  
Fire drills, shelter in p
lace, and other emergency drills are practiced regularly.  School
-
wide expectations for student 
conduct along with consistent enforcement by all school staff ensures a safe, orderly environment for student learning.  
School
-
wide, research
-
based curriculum,
 
from "Positive Action", "Time to Teach", "Love and Logic" and "Community 
Matters", are used to ensure student awareness and improvement in personal behaviors that promote school safety.  
Administrators, teachers and aides conduct playground supervision, r
egularly referring to our "Camino ROCKS" motto 
(Respectful & Responsible, On
-
task, Community, Kindness and Safe).  All efforts to ensure building safety, cleanliness and 
adequacy have been successful.
 
 
We are proud of the safety record of our buses.  Many 
Camino students ride our buses, driven by experienced, licensed 
drivers. Camino recently participated in the AB923 School Bus Replacement Grant through the El Dorado County Air 
Quality Management District to replace two aging buses. Here at Camino, student
 
safety is of primary importance!
