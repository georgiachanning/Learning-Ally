Condor Elementary School, a school committed to the great success of all students, continues to 
demonstrate an outstanding record of 
excellence. Our comprehensive academic programs are 
designed to provide students with a rigorous and student driven plan where all students can and 
will succeed. We believe that all of our students are capable of achievement at high levels of success 
throu
gh rigorous instruction, authentic student engagement, and preparedness for college and 
careers in our ever changing 21st century. This annual report is designed, in part, to communicate 
our commitment to excellence. Our goal is to share valuable informati
on about our instructional 
programs, social/behavioral systems, academic achievements, school facilities and safety, highly 
qualified staff members, textbooks, and expenditures.
 
 
All students are supported through the use of specific curriculum and instruc
tional strategies. 
School
-
wide master scheduling of academics occurs in kindergarten through sixth grade. This allows 
all staff to maximize resources and provide equal opportunities for all of our students. Students 
receive content and instruction more clo
sely aligned to their current academic achievement. This 
Response to Intervention Model provides ongoing support for all children in both academic and 
social pursuits. We are a school dedicated to team vision, focus and implementation through shared 
goals.
 
This approach to building and maintaining a school of excellence is achieved through 
communication, articulation, and teamwork.
 
 
We welcome all members of the community to join Condor in support of each student. Condor 
Elementary strives to ensure that it
 
is a place where all students feel safe, parents and all 
stakeholders feel welcome and that a true partnership is established where we work together for 
the success of each and every one of our Mighty Condors.  We have an excellent support system 
with par
ents who help our students, teachers, and school through their volunteer services all to 
the benefits and growths of our students.  Please contact our front office or the Parent Teacher 
Organization for more information.
 
 
As with each academic year, we loo
k forward to being a part of the future success of each student, 
every staff member, and all invested stakeholders.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condit
ion and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annua
l school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the Calif
ornia 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.
