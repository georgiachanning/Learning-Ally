By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Bagby School is well maintained by a staff of custodians. They provide cleanliness and support of the facility in many ways. 
They are supplemented by district staff who regularly assist in b
uilding maintenance. An automated work order system 
ensures the jobs are completed in a timely manner.
 
 
The school is situated on about 10 acres, with an average classroom size of 960 square feet. The school has a separate 
staff room with adult restrooms a
nd kitchenette facilities. Play areas have been replaced and upgraded to code over the 
past 4 years at our school site. Recent bond measures passed with overwhelming community support, the first providing 
funds for enrichment programs and the second fundin
g a multimillion dollar facility update.
 
 
These upgrades have included electrical upgrades, air conditioning, painting, and refurbishing the bathrooms. All 
classrooms were refurbished and updated with new flooring, cabinetry, teaching surfaces and an expan
ded student 
services area. Our facilities are monitored on a constant basis by the principal and district office staff. In 2015, new 
perimeter fencing was installed.  Solar arrays were added in 2015 to meet 85% of the schools electrical needs. The main 
pla
y ground was updated in 2015 to enhance the play experience.
 
 
Safety and health concerns are a top priority. Our beautifully remodeled school enjoys a park
-
like campus, with large 
grassy areas, towering trees, safe playgrounds, and parent and student paint
ed murals reflecting our culture. Our 
Community Garden adds to this lovely setting and students care for their environment by collaborating with Our City 
Forest to plant trees, picking up trash, and working in the gardens.
 
 
Cambrian is extremely proud of t
he technology infrastructure. There is one computer to every 2.8 students available in 
classrooms. Computers are networked and linked to the internet. There is a district
-
wide technology specialist available 
to the schools and additional support from teach
er representatives at each site who assist fellow teachers with any 
problems or questions that might occur. The district
-
wide technology plan is in place and continues to be updated to 
enhance computer use in the learning process.

Parent's are welcome everyday to 
be part of the school through multiple volunteer opportunities.  Bagby's parent 
volunteers and our Home and School Club share the commitment to high academic and behavioral standards. Our parent 
community is highly organized and operates much like an exten
ded family to support the social, emotional and physical 
domains for all students. Parents are well acquainted with the rigor of our curriculum and work to provide and plan 
enrichment opportunities that move all students toward proficiency. The Home and Sc
hool Club has helped to fund 
assemblies, field trip experiences, access to visual and performing arts as well as standards based enrichment 
opportunities in collaboration with school staff.  The Bagby Home and School Club strives to provide parents, studen
ts, 
and our community occasions to come together for a variety of fun and educational activities including Halloween Fun 
Night, STEM Fun Run, Ice Cream Social, Art Show, Field Day, STEAM Fair, and family dinner nights to name a few.  Parents 
have a variety
 
of ways to help in our classes as Arts Vista instructors, Reading/Math volunteers, Project Cornerstone ABC 
Readers, Makers Space guides, and Field Trip chaperones.
 
 
Bagby also offers parent education nights for parents that focus on reading and math to su
pport their students at home 
and increase the home and school connection.
 
 
Bagby also has an active and engaged School Site Council and English Learner Advisory Committee with members who 
give input on the school's LCAP (Local Control Accountability Plan),
 
initiatives and priorities.

The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is developed and reviewed with participation from staff, the school site council 
and local law enforcement representatives at the beginning of every school year
. The plan provides students and staff a 
means to ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. Components of the Comprehensive Safety Plan include the 
following: child abuse reporting procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe ingress
 
and egress from 
school. We ensure the safety of our students and have established emergency procedures that we have developed as we 
work closely with local law enforcement agencies in the preparation, review, and annual adoption of school safety plans. 
We
 
review suspension and expulsion policies and procedures; policy prohibiting discrimination, harassment, hate crimes, 
intimidation, and bullying aligned to district guidelines and procedures. All staff members complete child abuse reporting 
and harassment 
training along with school discipline policies and procedures. 
 
 
We support:
 

 
Building a sense of community and belonging where every child feels included and valued.
 

 
Teaching children positive social skills and attitudes including resolving conflicts 
without physical aggression.
 

 
Responding appropriately to emergencies and disasters to keep children safe.
 

 
An environment that is free of physical and verbal harassment of any kind, including teasing and bullying.
 

 
A focus on fostering a growth mindset and w
illing to take risks in learning

Staff development is designed in our primary areas of focus: Common Core shift, English Learner instruction, questioning 
for critical thinking, and mathematical understanding. Using CCSS assessments, professional d
evelopment is aligned with 
district, school, and/or individual professional needs to ensure teachers have the adequate background, skills, and 
materials they need to support student learning. When new programs are introduced (e.g. math, science or language
 
arts), 
specific time is dedicated to staff development to ensure the even and effective implementation of the program.
