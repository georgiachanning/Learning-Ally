SCHOOL MISSION STATEMENT
 
Our vision of an 
effective school includes a school community that collaborates to promote student 
achievement and positive character development. Using brain compatible research and best 
teaching practices, Pine Street Elementary School will teach the skills necessary for
 
students to 
become productive members of society. We strive to foster in each child a love of learning, good 
work habits, and a sense of personal responsibility.
 
 
COMMUNITY & SCHOOL PROFILE
 
Pine Street School serves about 430 students in grades 3

chool is located in the town of 
Bishop, California, midway between Reno, Nevada and Los Angeles, California, along scenic 
Highway 395.
 
 
Pine Street has 16 general education classrooms, three Dual Language Immersion (Spanish/ English) 
classrooms (3

special day class, and one resource classroom.  We support class size 
reduction in grade 3. Fourth and fifth grade classes are supported by a Physical Education Specialist 
and a Music/Art instructor in addition to the regular classroom teacher. Fifth grade
 
students may 
also choose to begin instrumental band instruction. All students have access to regularly scheduled

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Bishop Unified School District sets a high priority upon ensuring that sufficient and current textbo

instructional program. Bishop Unified School District held a Public Hearing on September 19, 2019  and determined that each s
chool within the District 
has sufficient and good quality textbooks or inst
ructional materials, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, 
including English learners, are provided their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. All
 
textbooks and instructional materials used within the District are aligned with the California State Content Standards and Fr
ameworks and have been 

-
based materials. Bishop Unified School District fol

-
year 
adoption cycle for core content materials.
 
 
The textbook adoption process begins with the formation of an Adoption Committee consisting of administrators and teachers. T
he committee identifies 
key elements to 
consider in the adoption decision
-
making process and establishes selection criteria based on State and District standards. The committee 
reviews instructional materials on the State list and invites publishers to provide an overview of their respective mat
erials. The committee examines each 
program and selects programs to be piloted. Recommended programs are available for 30 days prior to adoption at the school li
brary and District Office 
for teachers and parents to review. The feedback provided by teachers
 
and parents becomes the basis for the recommendations to the Board of Trustees 
for final adoption.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

The Comprehensive Safety Plan was developed by the school in consultation with local law enforcement in order to comply with 
Senate Bill 187 of 1997. 
The plan provides students and staff a means to 
ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. Components of the Comprehensive Safety Plan include 
child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedure
s for safe ingress and 
egress f
rom school, sexual harassment policies, and dress code guidelines. The District collaborated with the Bishop Police Departmen
t to update the 
plans at all the schools. This process created a comprehensive crisis management plan for all schools in the commun
ity. The plan was completed and 
reviewed with school staff in August 2012. A copy of the plan is available to the public at the school and District office.

All training and curriculum development at Plm Street Elementary School 
revolves around the California State Content Standards and Frameworks. 
Teachers align classroom curriculum to ensure that all students either meet or exceed State proficiency levels.
 
Professional development within the District addresses the individual nee
ds of teachers as well as broader school concerns. Five mandatory staff 
development days are provided annually. The District analyzes test scores and conducts a teacher survey to determine areas in
 
the curriculum that need 
to be modified. The staff develop
ment committee coordinates their offerings based on the District Leadership Team/District Assistance and Intervention 
Team goals set out annually for staff development related to those goals.
 
 
The District participates in the State
-
sponsored Beginning Teac
hers Support and Assessment (BTSA) program. The goals of the BTSA program are to help 
new teachers succeed, foster increased retention of quality teachers within the teaching profession, and to improve instructi
on for students. Bishop 
Unified School Distri
ct offers a wide variety of additional support and professional development opportunities for its teachers, administrators, c
lassified 
staff, and substitutes.
