O
n behalf of the staff at James Madison Elementary School, I am delighted to welcome you to the 
2019
-
2020 school year! We 
are looking forward to a productive partnership with you to ensure our 
children can achieve their highest potential. Our goal is to ensure that all students become critical 
thinkers, active problem
-
solvers, inquisitive readers, diligent researchers and pro
lific writers. 
Teachers diligently work to refine their instructional strategies and identify best practices within 
Professional Learning Communities. Grade levels meet regularly to analyze student progress and 
identify areas of focus. We do this to prepar
e students for the demands of the real
-
world so our 
students may become productive citizens, become our future leaders, and contribute and give back 
positive to the community. Education is a joint venture between school and home. As we work with 
our studen
ts to help them learn about the world around them through the prescribed curriculum, 
we very much appreciate the support that parents give their children at home as they strive to 
reach their learning goals. The foundation of a successful school is the coo
peration between the 
students, staff, parents and community. I look forward to a great year! On behalf of the staff of 
James Madison Elementary School, I want to thank you for being a part of our school community! 
Sincerely, Mercedes Ochoa Principal, James
 
Madison Elementary School

School Profile (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
James Madison Elementary is one of 26 elementary/middle/comprehensive/ alternative high 
schools in Madera Unified School District. Currently, 2019
-
2020 school year enrollment is at 653 
students. All programs follow a traditional school year calendar. Madison students participated in 
Extended Learning summer school program during the 2018 summer session. Madison Elementary 
sits in the heart of Madera
 
next to Madera High School. Our free and reduced lunch rate is at 96%. 
Our current English Language Learner population is 54.6% with the Spanish language spoken by 
98% of our EL students. Advanced Learners: Although we no longer have the GATE program ( Gi
fted 
and Talented Education), we still work hard to provide opportunities for our advanced students. 
Special Education Program:  Madison provides Center
-
Based Instruction for RSP students. Students 
are in the general education classroom for the majority of
 
their day. Support is provided from a 
special education staff member during a portion of their time, while pull out of the general 
education environment for more intense instruction is determined based on the needs identified 

ed Education Plan (IEP). Madison has one full
-
time special education 
teacher and two full time special education aides to support our students. English Learner Program:  

glish Language 
Development) is taught to our English learners for an average of 30
-
45 minutes a day. Students are 
grouped by their language levels so that instruction can be targeted towards their specific areas of 
need. The emphasis is on oral language, l
istening, reading, writing, and thinking. 
Teachers evaluate 
students and monitor their progress. The results of these tests help teachers determine next steps 
for instruction.

Dual Language Instruction Program: Dual Language Instruction is a form of educat
ion where students are taught literacy and content in 
two languages. It prepares our students for the 21st
-
century learning, as well as college and career opportunities that will lead to success 
in a global economy. We have highly qualified bi
-
literate tea
chers to ensure success in the program. The Dual Language Instruction (DLI) 
Program uses core curriculum taught in both Spanish and English. The teacher never uses both languages at the same time. Teac
hers are 
highly trained in delivering lessons that are 
understood by all students, regardless of home language. Hands
-
on experiences help students 
learn the language and content in a supportive environment. California Academic Standards are taught in all subjects areas. T
eachers 
receive continuous professional
 
development to enhance the delivery of instruction that promotes high levels of academic language and 
literacy.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contain
s information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes
 
how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructi
onal Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Madera Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018, and determined that each school within the district had sufficien
t and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to th
e settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Text
books and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the state are reviewed by a
ll teachers
 
and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The main campus was built in 1951, with 
additional portables added over the years. Madison now consists of 31 classrooms, one state preschool 
classroom, a multipurpose/cafeteria room, a library, a staff lounge/workroom, staff meeting room, and administration offices.
 
All of the classrooms are 
in
 
good repair, as is evidenced by the annual Williams report. Playground space is adequate for the number of students we have e
nrolled; providing them 
with ample opportunity to be active during their recess time.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
The site administration wo
rks daily with a custodial staff of 3.0 full
-
time employees to ensure that the school maintains cleanliness and safety. A staggered 
shift schedule ensures one custodian is available on campus from 6:00 a.m. to 10 p.m. A two
-
person team from the district ma
intenance department 
services the larger maintenance needs about every six weeks. The district makes a great effort to ensure that all schools are
 
clean, safe, and functional. 
To assist in this effort, the District uses a facility survey instrument develop
ed by the State of California Office of School Construction. The district 
governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at 
the district office for review. 
The school grounds are cl
ean and safe thanks to the efforts of many people. Madison has its own custodial staff that takes care of daily cleaning and 
maintenance.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the S
tate priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education populat
ion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
alig
ned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

however, the number of students test

School Safety Plan
 
Staff members supervise 
our school playground before school, during recess and after school to ensure student safety. James Madison Elementary has 
adopted Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS) as the foundation for enhancing the positive atmosphere of our s
chool. P
BIS is a proactive, 
team
-
based framework for creating and sustaining safe and effective schools. Emphasis is placed on prevention of problem behavior,
 
development of 
pro
-
social skills, and the use of data
-
based problem solving for addressing existing behav
ior concerns. For this 2019
-
20 school year, James Madison 
Elementary School continues to have staff participate in PBIS. The MTSS ( Multi Systems of Support) team continues enhancing 
the implementation of 
PBIS as a framework for creating and sustaining saf
e and effective school. MTSS meetings are interactive, activity based preparation for implementation 
of School
-
wide PBIS. Parents and students are informed of school rules and discipline policies through behavior assemblies, school
-
wide outdoor 
announcemen
ts, and during parent meetings such as ELAC, Parent Club and SSC. These policies are also included in the Parent/Student hand
book that is 
sent home at the beginning of the school year. James Madison School regularly undergoes a thorough safety evaluation a
s a result of Madera Unified 

lement requirements. Our 
District also provides a maintenance team that reviews safety issues on our c
ampus monthly. The School Safety Plan was reviewed and updated on March 
2nd, 2019 by the School Safety Committee, SSC, faculty, and other stakeholders. Revisions are based on feedback received from
 
parents, staff, and 
students on a school
-
wide survey. The 
key elements of the plan include regular inspection and maintenance of the campus, emergency procedures, an 
emergency alarm system, a specific campus emergency plan, and a list of emergency phone numbers. The entire staff is trained 
on portions of the plan
 
and various emergency procedures throughout the year.
