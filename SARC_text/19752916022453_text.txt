ht
tps://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enrol
lment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 11, 2018 and determined that ea
ch school within the district had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of Californ
ia. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own ind
ividual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education,
 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by a
ll teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All
 
recommended materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.
 
The table displays information collected in October 2018 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

ctional materials used at the school.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
McKinley Elementary School was originally constructed in 1938 with additions occ
urring between 1938 and 1950. Situated on 8.26 acres, the school is 
currently comprised of 31 classrooms, a multipurpose room, a staff lounge, an administrative office, a library, a computer la
b, a STEM lab, a maker space, 
a music room, counseling offices,
 
and two playgrounds. The campus was modernized in 1994 which included heating and air conditioning in all 
classrooms, handicap accessibility to restrooms, and new doors and handicap hardware. In 2006 construction was completed on a
 
two story 15,000 
square
 
foot classroom building with restrooms and kindergarten classrooms. Site work included an additional parking area and new pla
yground surfacing 
and equipment for the kindergarten area. Construction of the upper playground was completed in 2006
-

, all modernization construction was 
completed.  The chart illustrates the results of the most recent school facilities inspection. While reviewing this report, p

a regular basis, with heavy maintenance functions 
occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered by San Gabriel Unified Schoo

school grounds and facilities remain in excellent repa
ir. A work order process is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. Emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority; repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received
.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The S

expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes the fo
llowing: Roofing, Plumbing, Heating, 
Air conditioning, Electrical systems, Floor systems, and Interior or exterior painting.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

surveys.
 
 
A constructive evaluation process promotes quality instruction and is a 
fundamental element in a sound educational program. Evaluations and formal 

 
Temporary and 
probationary teachers are evaluated twice
 
a year and tenured teachers are evaluated every other year. Evaluations are conducted by the principal, who 
has been trained and certified for competency to perform teacher evaluations. Evaluation criteria includes the following:
 

 
Engaging and Supporting A
ll Students in Learning
 

 
Understanding and Organizing Subject Matter for Student Learning
 

 
Assessing Student Learning
 

 
Creating and Maintaining Effective Environments for Student Learning
 

 
Planning Instruction and Designing Learning Experiences for All Student
s
 

 
Developing as a Professional Educator
 
Staff members build teaching skills and concepts through participation in conferences and workshops throughout the year. For 
the past three years, the 
district has sponsored three staff development days annually wher
e teachers are offered a broad
-
based variety of professional growth opportunities in 
curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies. Staff development day topics included reviewing testing data and differen
tiated instruction.
 
 
For additional support in
 
their profession, teachers can request support from the District's instructional coaches and attend additional trainings. New
