By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Brook Knoll, a California Distinguished School and Gold Rib
bon Award winner, was constructed and opened its doors in 
1964 as part of the Scotts Valley Unified School District.  Incorporated in 1966, Scotts Valley is a quiet, family
-
oriented 
community located approximately 30 miles southwest of San Jose near the co
astal resort of the Santa Cruz Mountains, 
where its inhabitants enjoy a mild climate and a safe, tight
-
knit community.  Our TK through 5th grade student population 
numbers approximately 530.  The demographics reflect our community with approximately 69% of
 
our student population 
is Caucasian, 8% identify as 2 or more races including Caucasian, 7% Asian, 14% Hispanic or Latino, and less than 1% 
African
-
American, and 1% American Indian or Alaskan Native.  Approximately 12% of our students are socio
-
economical
ly 
disadvantaged, 12% of our students have identified disabilities, and about 4% are English learners..  There are 22 classroom 
teachers, including general and special education, with additional resource support offered including OT, Speech, APE, 
School Ps
ychologist, Counseling, Behavior Specialist, and a variety of enrichment teachers such as:  art, PE, life lab, 
computer lab, and music.
 
 
Brook Knoll's mission is to ensure that each student is valued, challenged, and successful.  We provide a high quality 
education for all students through a strong academic focus on common core state standards.  We use a variety of teaching 
strategies continuously evolving through sustained staff development to engage our students in the 4 C's of the common 
core, including 
critical thinking, creativity, communication, and collaboration.  We believe in student responsibility and 
engagement reinforced through regular assessments, effective homework and immediate feedback.  We have high 
standards of performance and recognition 
programs for student effort and achievement.  We believe in the development 
of student self
-
esteem through skill sets in cooperative learning strategies and positive problem solving so critical to 
student success now and in the long term as life
-
long learn
ers.  We embrace our mission through collaboration with our 
entire community including our school, our families and our community partners.  With the support of our school 
community and the commitment of all staff members, Brook Knoll continues to be one o
f the highest performing 
elementary schools in the county.  The California Business for Education Excellence Foundation and Just for the Kids
-
California recognized the academic achievement of Brook Knoll students by placing Brook Knoll on their 2007
-
2012 H
onor 
Roll for being in the top 6% of California Schools, based on test scores.  For the 2015

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Brook Knoll School takes pride in the safety and cl
eanliness of our school facility. Routine upkeep (litter pick
-
up, campus 
beautification) is a joint effort involving the entire school community of students, staff and parents.  Volunteer work days 
have greatly improved the appearance and climate of our sc
hool.   We have an active Safety Committee that reviews 
safety plans, procedures, and provides safety education to our staff. We have a comprehensive Emergency Action Plan in 
place and drills are routinely held. In addition to our biannual safety self
-
eval
uation process, our campus has an annual 
safety inspection performed by an external agency to assist us in providing safe facilities.  Our custodial staff consists of
 
one daytime facilities specialist, one half time evening facilities specialist, as well a
s the district maintenance crew. These 
facilities specialists are responsible for and take pride in keeping a clean beautiful campus for all. Aside from their janit
orial 
responsibilities they also perform routine maintenance tasks.  District maintenance pe
rsonnel attend to maintenance 
needs at each campus on an ongoing basis, with service requests being managed through a web
-
based work order system. 
To assist in the effort to ensure clean, safe and functional facilities, the district uses a facility survey 
instrument developed 
by the State of California Office of Public School Construction and conducts annual self inspections, recording the results 
of the inspection on the survey document. Below is more specific information about the school and the efforts m
ade to 
ensure that students and staff are provided with a clean, safe and functional learning environment.

Age of the School Buildings: Built in 1964, Brook Knoll has 14 permanent classrooms, and an administrative wing which 
also houses both a library and
 
a computer lab. Twelve of the classrooms are portables. The permanent buildings were 
modernized during the 2000
-
2001 academic year.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule: The district has adopted cleaning standards. The principal works daily with the 
custodial 
staff to develop and adjust cleaning schedules to ensure a clean, safe campus.
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance personnel make every effort to ensure that the repairs necessary to keep 
the school in good repair and working order are c
ompleted in a timely manner. Safety issues are given the highest priority.
 
Completed improvements:  Storage facilities (such as:  closets, cargo containers, sheds, etc) have all been emptied and 
reorganized to allow proper and efficient storage of material
s, equipment, furniture, and resources.  This has allowed staff 
to remove items that may have been stored in the classroom which could cause clutter or unsafe conditions.  All 
classrooms have been outfitted with appropriate wire covers on the floor, non
-
cu
rriculum related appliances have been 
removed, and proper stepladders are now kept in each classroom.  Dead  trees have been removed from campus and the 
property perimeter and the quad trees were cut down to avoid the possibility of being a safety hazard i
n inclement 
weather.  Rain gutters and downspouts have been repaired and altered to allow for proper water run
-
off.  Drain pipes 
have been cleared of all clogs and debris, and several asphalt and cement sidewalk areas have been regraded and/or 
replaced ent
irely to encourage proper water flow and avoid build
-
up or water damage.  Classroom roofs have had all leaks 
repaired, custom covers have been installed above heater
-
a/c units to address design flaws that were encouraging water 
build
-
up.  New drains have b
een installed in the quad to avoid flooding.  Additional retaining walls have been installed 
around the sand playgrounds and around landscape areas with ground cover, and along the edge of the property where 
it meets the neighborhood road.  Bio
-
hazard bags
 
were purchased and additional sharps containers have been obtained.  
Kitchen knives have been properly sharpened and are now kept in a proper knife block.  Permanent shade/rain structures 
have been built over the upper/lower eating areas.  In collaboratio
n with the PTO, the lower campus lunch tables have 
been replaced and the upper campus lunch tables have been repaired and repainted.  Currently, through PTO funding and 
the charitable donations of several local companies, the track and field are being redo
ne.  Custodial and office staff are 
now included in safety meetings and regular meetings are now scheduled for Yard Supervision staff.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students tested includes all 
students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only s
tudents who received 
scores.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Brook Knoll 
School is proud of its strong partnership with our parents and community. The combined staff and community 
resources have resulted in enhanced and extended educational opportunities for our students. Parent volunteers are 
highly respected and valued in our
 
classrooms, playground, library, and office.  In addition to volunteers, many parents 
are employed at Brook Knoll as office and/or classroom aides as well as yard duty supervisors.
 
 
Brook Knoll has an active School Site Council composed of five parents an
d four staff members. This group monitors our 
School Based Coordinated Program. They help determine school goals and manage a coordinated budget. This year, School 
Site Council monitored and revised The Single School Plan for Student Achievement, redesigne
d, distributed and analyzed 
the annual Parent, Teacher, and Student Surveys, budgeted funds to meet School Improvement goals, sponsored 
alternative programs for students during recess, reviewed and revised our School Safety Plan, monitored and funded (with
 
support from PTO funding) a Reading Assistance Program for 1st through 5th grade and Math Assistance for 1st through 
5th grade students. School Site Council provided guidance and leadership in all areas of school improvement and assists 
in connecting the 
efforts of the school and the district's LCAP.
 
 
Our Parent Teacher Organization supports classroom and school activities through fund
-
raising activities and volunteer 
efforts. They sponsored after school science, band, art, drama, robotics, bucket band, wo
rld
-
language, computer 
programming, a variety of fitness programs, and many other enrichment activities. In addition, the PTO funded in
-
school 
K
-
5th grade music program, a computer lab technician, 50% of campus supervision, K
-
5th grade art program, a part
-
time 
computer
-
science teacher, mileage club, counseling, and special assemblies. The PTO Life Lab Committee sponsored 

contributions have 
included Music instruments, science supplies, Life Lab upgrades, art materials, and instructional 
materials to supplement budget cuts and enhance classroom curriculum, playground upgrades, and facility improvements.  
We have many parents involved with tech
nology, providing equipment, repair, advice, in
-
service, and direct instruction 
with students and teachers.  The parents organized themselves to form the Parents on Patrol, a group of parents who 
coordinate and monitor our parking lot traffic during drop
-
o
ff.  They also organize several community building events such 
as, but not limited to:  movie nights, laser tag, pizza nights, kinder social, back to school potluck, skate party, campus cl
ean
-
up, summer kickoff potluck, book fairs, and more.
 
 
Some parents 
choose to participate by joining community or district committees and groups such as the Wellness 
Committee, DLAC, or the Ed
-
Foundation.  The Scotts Valley Educational Foundation had excellent participation by the 
Brook Knoll community and staff. Through c
ommunity fundraising events, the SVEF provided funds for equipment and 
educational materials to enhance student learning and growth. SVEF fully funds our Librarian position and has contributed 
money towards funding a music program for students with special
 
needs.

Behavior Intervention and Support program and the SPSA, a variety of interventions such as weekly S
tudent Support Team 
meetings, monthly Intervention Assistance Team meetings, counseling services, lunch bunch groups, social/emotional 
classroom curriculum, and a myriad of special assemblies are utilized to address the social and emotional safety of 
stude
nts.  Brook Knoll continues to partner with community resources in providing students with anti

-
being.  Brook Knoll will continue to implement curriculum to train students in understanding what 
sexual harassment is 
and how to avoid it.

The District provides two staff development days each year.  Content of those days for 2019
-
20 focused on training in 
using data systems and technology, and social and emotional support for all 
students, and NGSS.  Additionally, teams of 
teaching staff and administration attend ongoing training throughout the year.  Some of the more notable trainings are 
SVMI (Silicon Valley Math Initiative) through a grant with S4C (Santa Cruz County College Com
mitment), English Learners, 
NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards), PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention and Support, IB (International 
Baccalaureate) training in specific subjects, and Special Education topics including compliance, behavior analysis and
 
strategies.
 
 
All certificated staff meet weekly in a restructured day schedule in order to have Professional Development and 
Collaboration. The weekly work centers around district goals to increase student achievement and the site Single School 
Plan for S
tudent Achievement. Our plan identifies specific goals for school improvement in all subject areas. These goals 
are part of the outcome of staff and School Site Council analysis of student achievement data, as well as feedback from 
parent and student surve
ys. Staff development needs are identified as a result of student achievement performance. 
During the past several years, emphasis was given to learning strategies appropriate to English Learners, students with 
disabilities, analysis of student work, and s
trategies to address needs of students not meeting standards. We continue to 
work on essential standards and benchmarks. The weekly professional development time provides opportunities for cross 
grade level collaboration. All sites participate in the New T
eacher Project for first and second year teachers.
