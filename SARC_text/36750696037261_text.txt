School Description
 
Our fundamental purpose is to amplify the social, emotional and intellectual growth for every 
member  of our learning community every single day.  Sierra Vista staff will provide daily 
opportunities for meaningful learning experiences through the practice 
of compassion, integrity, 
and acceptance, while supporting the need of our students, staff and families
 
 
Sierra Vista School is one of 14 schools in the Upland Unified School District. Sierra Vista is a Title 
One school. We are located at the base of 
the San Gabriel Mountains in the northeast section of 
the City of Upland, and we have a rich and diverse population that is a mixture of residential homes, 
apartments, townhomes / condominiums, and commercial buildings. Our student population of 
515, which
 
includes grades Pre
-
 
Kindergarten through 6th, reflects the changing demographics of 
our community. We value the rich experiences and opportunities that our diversity offers as we 
learn, play, and work together. Everything that we do is designed for your 
child to get maximum 
benefit and enjoyment at school.  Education is a collaborative process that requires time and 
effective communication between home and school.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a Sc
hool Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local
 
Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with da
ta reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the
 
district office.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The Upland Unified School District believes that high quality, research
-
based professional development is essential to continuous improvement of 
teaching skills and concepts. The District provides or coordinates on
-
going training based on needs identified 
through student performance indicators, 
including results of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, the English Language Proficiency Assessme
nts for California, District 
iReady benchmark assessments, and input from sites regarding s
pecific needs. Professional development is aligned with the District Strategic Plan for 
Student Achievement and Board goals. Teachers, paraprofessionals and administrators participate in workshops, and conferences
 
that allow them to 
grow professionally and
 
provide opportunities for collegial sharing. Regular meetings of teacher leaders in literacy, mathematics, reading interventi
on 
and technology as well as follow
-
up coaching support full implementation of training. Additionally, each school provides time f
or teacher collaboration 
on student achievement data, curriculum development, and review of classroom
-
based performance measures. Examples of workshops and coaching 
implemented as the result of analysis of student achievement include: Effective Teaching St
rategies, Classroom Management, Curriculum Alignment and 
Mapping, English Language Development, AVID, Thinking Maps, Positive Behavior Intervention Support, Social Emotional Learning
, 21st Century 
Classroom Technology, Common Core State Standards, Next Gen
eration Science Standards, Modeling Academic Language, Universal Design for Learning, 
and Parent Engagement. Staff members participate in professional development in all
-
day workshops, after
-
school workshops and meetings, individual 
coaching/mentoring, and
 
off
-
site conferences. The Induction (formerly BTSA) program provides support to new teachers. The Peer Assistance and Review 
Program is available to provide support to teachers in the areas of content knowledge and teaching strategies. Currently, the
 
Dist
rict calendar includes a 
collaboration day schedule each week to allow for on
-
going teacher dialogue and collaboration to meet student needs.
