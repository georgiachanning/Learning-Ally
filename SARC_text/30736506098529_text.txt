By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Santiago Hills Mission Statement reads: Santiago Hills Elementary School is committed to all students reac
hing their 
highest potential by establishing a curriculum that meets or exceeds government standards for education; providing 
programs that develop children's mental, physical and social skills; fully equipping students with essential technology for 
21st c
entury challenges; supporting the work of teachers; and partnering with parents and the community to create an 
environment geared to the success of all students.
 
 
Santiago Hills serves a diverse student population, with students from transitional kindergar
ten through 6th grade in 
general education, special education, and Alternative Program for Academically Advanced Students (APAAS) programs.  

-
2020 site goals is to create a base for future growth and cont
inued 
achievement. Santiago Hills Elementary students, including English learners, are excelling academically when compared 
to state, county, and district achievement. However, we recognize that we need to prioritize goals that focus on our low 
socioeconom
ic and disability students to ensure they are also making academic strides. Our 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement (SPSA) proposes two goals.  The first SPSA goal is to more fully understand the needs of our English Learning 
population, and to implement n
ew and best practices to serve them more effectively.  Goal two is Improve rate of chronic 
absenteeism by offering an Independent Study option for extended absences.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Our school district works to stay abreast of changing needs by providing a safe, functional, and attractive environment.  
During the summer of 2009, the school was thoroughly modernized.  New restroom facilities replaced all existing 
restrooms, the campus has been updated to meet ADA codes, classrooms and work areas have all been updated and the 
district, site and PTA have wo
rked to upgrade furniture and materials.  In spring of 2013, Santiago Hills updated the play 
structure. In September of 2013, a new shade structure was added to the playground area to allow students more shaded 
areas to eat snack and finish lunch. In the s
ummer of 2017, Santiago Hills was renovated to reconfigure the interior pods 
to include collaborative spaces for students, classroom doors, offices, and a new work room.  The collaborative spaces 
allow for additional flexible instructional areas for studen
ts to work in small groups and on projects.  Each of the three 
collaborative spaces was furnished with mobile tables, chairs, and bookshelves to provide versatile spaces that meet 
students' needs.  Interior classroom doors were added to improve student saf
ety.  New offices and a staff workroom were 
built to replace existing spaces that were repurposed for the collaborative space.  In the summer of 2017, the exterior of 
the school received a new coat of paint, brightening our campus with a clean, fresh appea
rance.  In fall 2018, outdoor 
tables were installed near the portable classrooms to allow for additional workspace for upper grade student projects and 
collaboration.  In addition, a shed for our Parent Teacher Association was added to accommodate storage 
needs.

students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Santiago Hills staff continues to review and train staff on our newly revised 
Comprehensive School Safety Plan. The 
plan was reviewed with staff and our parent community in October 2019. This plan was submitted to the district office in 
November 2019. Monthly emergency drills are planned and implemented, including lockdown, fire dri
lls, and full disaster 
drills. All staff is assigned and trained as part of an emergency team including first aid, search and rescue, and various 
other teams.  Emergency radios that allow schools to communicate with one another, the district office, and la
w 
enforcement are used for drills. The staff is continually updating supplies, plans, and training to be fully equipped and 
ready in the event of any emergency.

place of more than 40 specific funding categories, the new model has established three 
sources of state funding with 
increased local discretion to determine how best to spend those funds in the service of students.  All districts receive a 
BASE of per
-
student funding that varies slightly depending on grade level.  All districts also receive 
SUPPLEMENTAL 
funding.  IUSD has used BASE and SUPPLEMENTAL funding to support the following programs:
 
 
Site Programs and Services:  1) Support professional learning and teacher coaching through induction program, content 
TOSAs and teacher mentor program , 
2) provide summer school and summer athletic programs, 3) Allocating site funding 
and staffing to support student achievement through support of Professional Learning Communities (PLC) and site PLC 
coaches, 4) Elementary P.E. paraprofessionals, 5) Support 
for English language learners, 6) Elementary science, music, and 
art programs, 7) Purchase textbooks and instructional materials, 8) Develop a technology rich learning environment 
including; Technology matching programs, Technology Maintenance fund and sit
e technology support staff, 9) Maintain 
previously implemented class
-
size reduction, 10) Additional secondary sections to reduce class size, 11) Middle school 
zero period program, 12) Maintain positive behavioral intervention and support program, 13) Maint
ain site staffing with 
full
-
time assistant principals, 14) 450:1 counseling ratio, support for large elementary schools and elementary classroom 
aides, 15) Support interventions and supplemental programs impacting English learners, low income and foster yo
uth, 16) 
Continue to build Career
-
Technical Education pathways and blended 0n
-
line learning opportunities for students, 17) 
Develop mental health and wellness programs and hire district and site based staff including support for the Irvine Family 
Resource 
Center.
 
 
Finally, CONCENTRATION grant funding equal to 50 percent of the base is provided to districts in which English
-
learners, 
low
-
income students and foster youth exceed 55 percent of the total enrollment.  Irvine Unified School District is not 
eligibl
e for concentration funding because its enrollment does not exceed the 55 percent threshold.
