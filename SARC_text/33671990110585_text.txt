By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Accountability Report Card is issued annually for e
ach school in the State of California and provides an overview 
of selected conditions related to the school, its resources, its accomplishments, and the areas in which improvements may 
be needed. 
 
 
As you review the report for Sky View Elementary School, I
 
believe that a school dedicated to improvement and meeting 

diversity and well
-
balanced, rigorous instruction, Sky View Elementary Scho
ol in partnership with our community, will 
inspire students to reach their academic potential and become productive global citizens. Sky View teachers and staff 
believe in placing students first and continue to dedicate themselves to the profession by mode
ling expectations necessary 
to build scholars and character for tomorrow's challenges. Our students will continue to grow academically and socially 
because of the relevant, rigorous and standards
-
based instruction delivered by our instructors. With effecti
ve 
implementation of student
-
centered instruction, our highly qualified teachers will tie comprehensive learning to college 
and career readiness. In summary, we believe in high levels of learning for all students. 
 
 
Sky View school goals include: 
 
 
1.
 
All 
students by the culmination of their fourth year at Sky View Elementary School will be reading for 
understanding.
 
 
2.
 
All children will show mutual respect while being educated to the best of our ability in a clean, safe and caring 
environment.
 
 
3.
 
Sky Vie
w staff will create an environment that promotes ethics and emphasizes responsible behavior with fidelity 
to PBIS and AVID strategies.
 
 
When you visit our campus, you will see the latest technology to enhance the instruction delivered and students 
particip
ating in an array of educational opportunities that support their elementary school experience. We encourage all 

partner group and atte
nding school events. Together, we will make a positive difference in the life of Every Student, Every 
Day!

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Sky View was built in 2006. We have one day 
custodian and two night custodians who maintain our facilities and keep our 
school site clean. Each classroom is cleaned and vacuumed daily, and each bathroom is cleaned daily. Our site custodians 
perform routine maintenance and repairs, and our district m
aintenance personnel maintain landscaping and perform 
larger repairs on a regular weekly schedule. A shade covering the main playground and a shade covering for the 
kindergarten play structure were installed this school year. The blacktop on the playground
 
was recently repainted with 
lines for games. The blacktop lines in the front of the school were also repainted.  There are 38 classrooms.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called f
or by 
the Williams legislation of 2004. What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their 
structural integrity, electrical systems, heating and ventilation systems, and more. The important purpose of this 
assessment i
s to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good repair. If anything needs to be repaired, this 
assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for this assessment 
were written by the Off
ice of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You 
can look at the six
-
page Facilities Inspection Tool used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our dis
trict sent experts from our facilities team to inspect them. They used a 

e 
answered the questions you see on this report. Please no
te that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as 
of the date of the report. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Sky View Elementary School staff works with District Office staff to develop a site safety plan and an emergency 
preparedness plan, laying out procedures for responding to a wide 
variety of situations. Students and staff practice 
emergency procedures monthly and emergency plans are reviewed at staff meetings. Our school site has several 
representatives who participates on the District Disaster Preparedness Committee. The individual
s involved include 
teachers, administrators, and other school staff. Out of this group, there is a lead staff member who ensures all safety 
procedures are in place and updated. This person attends district meetings and brings valuable information back to t
he 
entire staff. Our Custodial staff and the District Maintenance staff inspect our school site for safety concerns frequently 
and scheduled "safety checks" on a weekly basis. Staff members and yard supervision aides monitor children whenever 
they are outs
ide the classroom.
 
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan includes data regarding crime, safe school procedures, and compliance with laws 

tions 
of dangerous pupils, (5) sexual harassment, (6) school
-
wide dress codes prohibiting gang
-
related apparel, (7) procedures 
for safe ingress and egress from school, (8) procedures to ensure a safe and orderly environment conducive to learning, 
and (9) e
xpectations and procedures on school discipline adopted pursuant to Ed Code Sections 35291 and 35291.5. A 
copy of the plan is available for inspection by the public at the front office. Together, the teachers and administration 
regularly review the rules f
or safe and responsible behavior in school and on the playground. The school's staff has 
established a culture of positive behavior interventions and supports (PBIS) that encompasses three universal 
expectations. The students are explicitly taught skills t
o help them be safe, respectful, responsible and leaders in all areas 
of the school campus life. We have an enclosed campus that is fully fenced. Visitors must enter and depart the school 
through the main door. All visitors must sign in at the office, wher
e they receive a visitor/volunteer badge to wear 
throughout their stay that describes there purpose of the visit and identifies the location on campus they will visit . When 
a request is made to take a child out of school for the day, the requesting adult 
must be on the emergency card and show 
identification before the child is summoned from the classroom. All visitors at Sky View Elementary School must sign in at 

nforce this system on a daily 
basis to ensure that all visitors have checked
-
in with the front office staff. Our school has a school Safety and Disaster 
Preparedness Plan with explicit procedures for handling emergency situations. We hold monthly practice 
drills for fire and 
lock
-
down procedures. The school's safety committee, which is comprised of staff and parents, review and update the 
safety plan annually. In October, we hold Disaster Drill to prepare students and make them aware of all procedures 
invol
ving an earthquake type of emergency or disaster. Students and staff practice different emergency procedures and 
drills including evacuation practices. Each day, the staff monitors the playground and campus before, during, and after 
school. We have strict 
policies that prohibit fighting and bullying. All playground equipment and school facilities are 
routinely inspected. We revise our School Safety Plan annually. Our safety plan was revised for the 2019

2020 school year 
to reflect current procedures and pra
ctices. The plan includes emergency procedures, exit routes, safe supervision of 
students, and student family reunification routines. We share the plan with all staff during a school
-
wide staff meeting. 
We practice fire, earthquake or lock
-
down drills mont
hly and hold staff training on emergency preparedness at the 
beginning, middle, and end of the school year.

Our students receive assistance from a variety of programs and services that are available during the instructional day as 
well as outside the instructional day. Our goal is to provide those services that align with the need of our student 
population with 
particular attention to significant sub
-
groups. Below is a description of the services for the 2019
-
2020 
school year: 
 

 
Bilingual Aide Support: Two Bilingual Instructional Aides support student in their primary language. The aides 
work with teachers and stu
dents in the classroom that have English Learners, ELs, with the highest need and as 
identified through our school plan. The goal is to provide support to our ELs throughout the day and across all 
content areas. Our bilingual instructional aides have recei
ved training on phonics, Close Reading, High Leverage 
Instructional Strategies, and the Universal Design Strategies. In addition, our teachers and bilingual instructional 
aides have been trained to implement Rosetta Stone, a second language acquisition pro

instructional support to ELs in order to support the lessons that teachers have taught during whole group 
instruction.

h teachers to discuss strategies that that will maximize 
lesson delivery effectiveness. The academic Coach will provide Professional Development to teachers 
throughout the year. She follows up on district Professional Development and provides additional as
sistance as 
informed by assessment data. The Academic Coach's main purpose is to increase the professional capacity of all 
teachers. Although the coach does not directly work with students, the services provided impact all students.
 

 
Targeted Intervention
-
 
Our students receive a block of Targeted Intervention, TI, throughout the week. During 
this time, the students receive leveled instruction that is targeted to specific ELA or Math standards. Student 
groups are flexible and re
-
alignment of the groups and pr
ograms happens after analysis of planned assessments 
which usually take place about every six weeks. During this time, teachers work with smaller groups of students 
on targeted skills as determined by student needs.

s services from a social worker intern who, in partnership with a school 
counselor, works with students on social skills in small and whole group settings. The intern may meet with 
students o an individual basis, with parent consent, to develop skill defic
its, work through grief, or be available 
for other urgent situation. The intern is on site twice a week to meet with students and help them be successful 
in school.

Professional Development for our staff is centered on school priority and focus areas and school initiatives with particular 
attention given to the delivery of first best instruction. School priority and 
focus areas are chosen based on state and 
district student achievement data. Specific professional development topics are covered in order to support instruction 
and the development of leadership skills for our student population. Topics include the implem
entation of high
-
leverage 
instructional strategies, ELA instruction, the writing process, instruction for English Learner students, AVID Elementary, 
the use of technology in the learning process, and classroom/school culture building through PBIS/MTSS. Pro
fessional 
development is ongoing and consistent throughout the year. School staff meets for professional development on weekly 
scheduled modified school days, through after school workshops, conference release time, and individual mentoring. 
Teachers new t
o the school meet on a regular basis with the Academic Content Coach for direction, training, and 
professional development on school priority areas. Our classified teaching and non
-
teaching staff participates in 
professional development particular to their
 
assigned duties and responsibilities. Supervision Aides meet once a month 
to review, train, and practice student high
-
leverage supervision skills as well as skills learned through our site initiative 
program, PBIS. Additionally, all teaching staff is prov
ided with the opportunity for guidance, collaboration, and lesson 

Planned are opportunities during strategic times of the year, where te
achers have classroom release time to meet for 
guidance and direction from the Academic Content Coach and/or school administrators. During these professional 
development opportunities, the teaching staff is guided towards an effective approach to lesson pl
anning and delivery. 
The objectives include having teachers gain a better understanding of the framework used to build the Unit of Study and 
provide collaboration time to lesson plan in order to enhance and enrich weekly lessons for the district
-
developed 
units 
of study.
