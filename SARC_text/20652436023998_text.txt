O
n behalf of the entire James Monroe staff, it is with great 
pleasure that I welcome you to James 
Monroe Elementary School. James Monroe is located at the Northeast edge of the city limits of 
Madera. We have an enrollment of 681 students in preschool through sixth
-
grade school. James 
Monroe is an award
-
winning schoo
l and has achieved California Distinguished School Status. James 
Monroe is a two
-
time California School Board Association Golden Bell Winner (1997 and 2001).
 
 
The teachers at James Monroe Elementary School work together as grade level teams collaborating 
o
n student learning. They are dedicated to teaching students and make sure they are learning so 
that they can achieve grade level proficiency. We want to offer each child an equal opportunity to 
gain a quality education and provide the students the basic fo
undation to achieve academically and 
become life
-
long learners and productive citizens in their community.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
Our mission is to teach students and make sure they are learning so that they can achieve grade 
level proficiency or above. We wan
t to offer each child an equal opportunity to gain a quality 
education and provide them the basic foundation to achieve academically and become lifelong 
learners and productive citizens in their community. We, along with the school board believe that 
the f
utures of children are driven by their aspirations, not bound by their circumstances.
 
 
School Vision Statement
 
In order for us to achieve our mission we must become facilitators of excellent first instruction 
focusing on Common Core State Standards. We mus
t become adaptive teachers who are flexible 
and willing to change and take on new challenges and opportunities. We must become a culture of 
collaboration in with the parents, teachers, and administrators work together for the good of the 
students.
 
 
School 
Values
 
We have to be examples of superior behavior and instill excellent values in our students by 
example. We will post our expectation values. We must become a professional working community 
who can respect others and their opinions and appreciate divers
ity. We must focus on learning, 
and intervention must be timely and not remediation. Teachers must work as a team and must 
have time to meet and analyze data and teaching practices.

ned to teach culturally diverse populations. ELD (English Language 
Development) is taught to our English learners for a designated 45 minutes daily and integrated ELD throughout the day. Stude
nts are 
grouped by their language levels so that instruction can
 
be targeted towards their specific areas of need. The emphasis is on oral language, 
listening, reading, and writing. The District provides a benchmark testing system for our English Language Learners. Teachers
 
evaluate 
students three to four times a year 
and monitor their progress. The results of these tests help teachers determine what skills need to be 
taught or reviewed.
 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). 
The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP),
 
which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more info
rmation about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page

. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
James Monroe Elementary was originally constructed in 1950 and is comprised of 34 classrooms, 1 multipurpose room/cafeteria, 
1 library, 1 staff lounge, 
and 2 playgrounds.
 
 
All of the classrooms are in 
good repair, as is evidenced by the positive Williams report that Monroe receives yearly. The following chart displays the 
results of the most recent school facilities inspection information. The chart displays data collected in August 2018.
 
 
Playground sp
ace is adequate for the number of students we have, providing them with ample opportunity to be active during their recess ti
mes. There 
is adequate space for staff to work, but storage space is still an issue. For 2018/19, a new, larger library is being de
veloped, which will include a variety 
of genres of books, areas for students to sit and read, a detailed system of locating books quickly and effiiciently, and tec
hnology for student to utilize in 
searching for books, taking AR tests, and as a resource for
 
informational access.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
 
The principal works daily with the custodial staff of 3 full
-
time employees to ensure that the school is maintained to provide for a clean and safe school. 
They work a staggered shift schedule with one of them avai
lable on campus from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. A three
-
person team from the district 
maintenance department services the larger maintenance needs about every six weeks. The district makes a great effort to ensu
re that all schools are 
clean, safe, and functio
nal. To assist in this effort, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of 
School 
Construction. The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of thes
e standards is available at the 
district office for review. The school grounds are clean and safe thanks to the efforts of many people. Monroe has its own th
ree full
-
time custodial staff 
that takes care of daily cleaning and maintenance.

Maintenance and R
epair
 
 
Each year Monroe is inspected by the Madera County Office of Education as part of the Williams Settlement and continues to me
et all requirements for 
a safe school. District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in g
ood repair and work orders are completed in a timely 
manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest priority is given to emergency repairs. While re
viewing this report, please 
note that even minor discrepancies are reported in
 
the inspection process. The items noted in the table have been corrected or are in the process of 
remediation.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priorit

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessme
nts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards,
 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the 
University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical
