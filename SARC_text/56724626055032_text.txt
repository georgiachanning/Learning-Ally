By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Charles F. Blackstock Junior High School was established in 196
6 and is located in the city of Oxnard, California. Blackstock 
is one of 11 schools in the Hueneme Elementary School District. Our school currently serves approximately 1,400 students 
in grades 6
-
8 and has over 100 full and part
-
time employees including te
achers, classified, support personnel and 
administrators. As a neighborhood school, we are fortunate to have strong community support. We have redesigned many 
of our traditional educational programs to include a 3
-
period block schedule, a later starting ti
me and reduced class sizes.  
As a community of educators, we are actively incorporating the California common core NGS and California state standards 
into every aspect of the curriculum. Our motivated and dedicated employees work alongside volunteers to ma
ximize the 
intellectual, physical, social and emotional potential of each and every student.
 
 
Working in partnership with other district programs, Blackstock is able to offer after school academic, enrichment and 
recreational classes to students. In partne
rship with California State University Channel Islands, Pepperdine University, 
California Lutheran University and the University of California at Santa Barbara, we are able to assist in the training of 
college graduates who wish to enter the field of educa
tion as a teacher, counselor or administrator. At Blackstock, we 
work hard to provide a positive educational environment characterized by high expectations for the individual success of 
students and staff alike. Blackstock uses CHAMPS, Safe School Ambassad
ors, Restorative Practices as well as Community 
Circles behavioral programs to provide structures and opportunities for all students to thrive in an educational 
environment that fosters excellence.
 
 
At Blackstock Jr. High School, we believe all students de
serve an education that incorporates a meaning
-
centered, 
integrated curriculum requiring critical thinking and the use of educational technology. Blackstock is a one to one 
technology school that allows students access to technology in every classroom envi
ronment. As an educational collective, 
the Blackstock staff believes that one of the most excellent, expedient and valuable ways in which to support the children 
and youth of our community is through the power of education.
 
 
The Blackstock staff believes s
tudents should be actively involved in a respectful, caring, cohesive educational community. 
Our students also have the opportunity to participate in AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) as an elective 
class, which includes Cornell note
-
taking, 
college tutors, and a clear path to college success. Blackstock is currently 
identified as an AVID School of Distinction.
 
 
Blackstock staff members are actively engaged in the perpetual process of building our capacity to communicate and 
involve all releva
nt constituents in the decision making process of the school.  We ensure that these decisions are made 
based upon data, research and relevant information. Continual development of associate administrators and teaching 
staff is essential for the long term s
ustainability of programs, and for attaining the highest achievement levels possible.
 
 
The children who attend our school will be safe, respected, and protected.  Blackstock staff inspires students to explore, 
dream big, and develop social and civic respon
sibility through a balanced learning program. Students will thrive as we 
foster perseverance and resiliency in a safe, culturally responsive, and inclusive environment.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Blackstock has in recent years completed classroom modernization including the redesign of classrooms and grounds 
with 
the removal and replacement of carpet, electrical systems, natural gas plumbing, furniture, windows, 
data/telecommunications, plumbing, as well as lighting advances and other improvements throughout common areas 
(office, library, etc.), and all perman
ent classrooms. Blackstock campus is in a nearly permanent state of improvement to 
facilitate the most excellent campus possible. Blackstock School maintains facilities that provide for a safe, clean learning
 
environment. The front office and entrance have
 
been redesigned to provide a more secure egress and regress for 
students, staff and community.  Our campus contains areas for classrooms, a cafeteria and kitchen, library, and support 
personnel space. In addition, we have adequate playground areas for all
 
students. Blackstock has recently installed a large 
shade structure to provide shade and cover for physical education classes as well as students during nutrition and lunch 
breaks. Blacktop areas will also be resurfaced and repainted in the near future.
 
 
Our school site is well maintained. Our classrooms and restrooms are cleaned on a daily basis by our custodial staff. The 
restrooms are inspected throughout the school day by the head custodian in order to identify items in need of repair and 
cleanliness. 
Graffiti is immediately removed when found and the yards and hallways are cleaned and/or swept daily. In 
addition to our custodial staff, Blackstock maintains a full time groundskeeper who constantly maintains the grass, plants, 
and yard areas. Daily inspe
ctions and staff input serve to identify repair and safety needs around campus. Small issues are 
resolved immediately and our district maintenance staff corrects larger needs as quickly as possible. Evidence of successful 
facility maintenance is apparent w
hen visiting our safe and clean campus. Together, school and district personnel work to 
ensure that the facility is maintained in a manner that assures it is clean, safe and functional as determined pursuant to 
an interim evaluation instrument developed by
 
the State of California Office of Public School Construction.

character traits, personal responsibility, and an understanding of the laws, rules and regulations of our society and school 
district. Our school has very high behavior and discip
line standards.
