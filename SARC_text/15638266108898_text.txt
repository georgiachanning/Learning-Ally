By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members 
should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
d
ropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Parents and community members are encouraged to participate in their child's education. We have a well defined 
volunteer process th
at allows parents to participate in a variety of ways. Our site has over 200 trained volunteers providing 
hours of support for our students and staff. Volunteers are on campus daily participating in classrooms, supporting 
teachers, attending special events
 
and serving as chaperones for field trips.
 
 
The School Site Council is the governance organization which welcomes participation from all community members, 
parents, staff, teachers and school administration. Our current organization includes equal numbers
 
of elected staff and 
parent volunteers who work cooperatively to develop the school plan, in addition to determining and monitoring the 
school site budget.
 
 
The Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) is a vital part of our school culture. The current PTO board
 
of parent volunteers 
work diligently to support the students and staff. PTO currently provides financial support for the school through field trip
 
opportunities, playground improvements, grounds beautification, technology, safety needs, and additional sup
plies and 
materials to support the teachers and students in the classroom. This work is supported by fundraising efforts including, 
but not limited to spirit wear sales, student store, special fundraising programs and hosting family events for the school 
c
ommunity.
 
 
The English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) is a committee advising the principal and staff on the development of the 
school site plan for English Learners, assisting in the development of the school
-
wide needs assessment and 
assisting in 
making parents aware of the importance of regular school attendance, curriculum, instruction, and other important 
information relating to their child's education..
 
 
Each of these organizations meet regularly. To learn more about specific oppor

School Safety 
Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Cummings Valley Elementary School is committed to providing a safe and secure campus for our students, staff and 
community. We believe that students thrive when they feel safe and connected. By identifying potential safety issu
es and 
prevention strategies our parents and staff can focus on the academic and social needs of our students. Monthly drills 
(including fire, earthquake, lockdown and bus evacuation drills) are conducted to provide practice and familiarity in case 
of an e
mergency. Disaster plans are posted in each classroom with emergency bags that include emergency contacts for 
our students. Each classroom also has a classroom safety bucket; it includes, water, food, toiletries, and an emergency 
radio. Our site has a disa
ster shed that is well stocked to include blankets, toiletries, water, tools, and an emergency radio. 
It is inventoried each year by school site staff. A monitored alarm system throughout the campus is used on the evenings, 
weekends and holidays.
 
 
Safe Sch
ools Campus Maps show the safe corridor maps and applicable school campus maps indicating safe entrance and 
exit areas for pupils, parents and school employees. The staff receives annual and as
-
needed training on their 
responsibilities during a school emer
gency. The staff is trained in playground supervision, TUSD Safe and Inclusive Schools 
Curriculum, Active Intruder training, Positive Behavior Intervention Supports (PBIS) and Restorative Practices. This is our 
fifth year of implementation on PBIS.
 
 
To ens
ure the safety of pupils and staff, all visitors to the campus, except pupils of the school and staff members, shall 
register immediately through the Raptor System upon entering any school building or grounds when school is in session 
and wear an identific
ation badge. The campus is secured at the start of school to the end of the school day. Early checkout 
of students requires parents and emergency contacts to show a valid I.D. and sign them out.
 
 
Discipline procedures focus on finding the causes of problem
s and working with all concerned to reach appropriate 
solutions. The school's discipline plan begins at the classroom level. Teachers use a visible discipline system in each 
classroom to communicate classroom rules, promote positive pupil conduct and reduc
e unacceptable conduct. 
Appropriate restorative practices or consequences are administered based on the severity of the pupil's misbehavior. 
Discipline data is reviewed and discussed each quarter by the PBIS team, which is made of teachers, staff, and 
admi
nistrators.

Cummings Valley Elementary School has the District's sexual harassment policy in a prominent location where specific 
rules, regulations and standards of conduct are rea
dily available. Additionally, a notice summarizing this sexual harassment 
policy appears in the Guide for Parents and Students distributed at the beginning of each school year to all parents and 
pupils, in Appendix C: Exhibits and Source Documents.
 
 
Our sc
