Elementary
 
School
 
district
 
administrators
 
have
 
the
 
task
 
and
 
responsibility
 
to
 
ensure
 
the
 
safety
 
of
 
their
 
students
 
and
 
staff
 
in
 
an
 
emergency,
 
whether
 
it's
 
an
 
earthquake,
 
a
 
flood
 
or
 
an
 
act
 
of
 
terrorism.
 
Developing
 
emergency
 
operations
 
plans
 
and
 
training
 
staff
 
in
 
emergency
 
response
 
procedures
 
is
 
required
 
by
 
law.
 
The
 
safety
 
of
 
students
 
and
 
staff
 
is
 
a
 
primary
 
concern
 
of
 
Benjamin
 
Foxen
 
School.
 
The
 
school
 
complies
 
with
 
all
 
laws,
 
rules
 
and
 
regulations
 
pertaining
 
to
 
hazardous
 
materials
 
and
 
state

The
 
school™s
 
disaster
 
preparedness
 
plan
 
includes
 
steps
 
for
 
ensuring
 
student
 
and
 
staff
 
safety
 
during
 
a
 
disaster.
 
Fire,
 
disaster,
 
and
 
earthquake
 
drills
 
are
 
conducted
 
on
 
a
 
regular
 
basis
 
throughout

closed
 
and
 
adult
 
supervision

school,
 
after
 
school
 
and
 
during

was
 
developed
 
by
 
the
 
school
 
in
 
consultation
 
with
 
local
 
first
 
responders
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
comply
 
with
 
Senate
 
Bill
 
187

a
 
means
 
to
 
ensure
 
a
 
safe
 
and
 
orderly
 
learning
 
environment.
 
Components
 
of
 
the

the
 
plan
 
annually
 
and
 
updates
 
it
 
as

on
 
the
 
new
 
curriculum.
  
Also,
 
an
 
instructional
 
strategy
 
to
 
promote
 
reading
 
is
 
being
 
implemented
 
in
 
grades
 
K-5
 
consisting
 
of
 
a
 
Reading
 
Workshop
 
using
 
Responsive
 
Teaching.
  
This
 
strategy
 
uses
 
current
 
best
 
practices
 
in
 
teaching,
 
while
 
supporting
 
the
 
individual
 
needs
 
of
 
every
 
student.
  
Furthermore,
 
as
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
ensure
 
the
 
success
 
of
 
Reading
 
Workshop,
 
we
 
are
 
providing
 
the
 
tools
 
to
 
set
 
up
 
a
 
leveled
 
classroom
 
library
 
at
 
each
 
grade
 
level,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
to
 
utilize
 
the
 
Fountas
 
&
 
Pinnell
 
Benchmark
 
Assessment
 
System
 
for
 
reading
 
assessment
  
Teachers
