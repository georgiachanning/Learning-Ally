Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Safety of students and staff is a primary concern. Adult supervision is provided in the classrooms and outside areas before 
and after school, and during nutrition
, lunch and passing times. Restrooms are supervised throughout the day. School 
administrators supervise entrance and exit points of the campus, along with campus assistants. To limit unauthorized 
access to our campus, gates are locked each morning when ins
truction begins, including the new security gate that directs 
all traffic during the school day through the school office. All visitors are required to sign in at the office and must wear
 
a 
visitor identification badge. Teachers, classified staff and after
 
school staff/coaches are on duty daily to supervise after
-
school tutorials, enrichment classes, and recreational activities.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud
y.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-

Date of Last Review/Update:     October 15, 2019
 
Date Last Discussed with Staff: October 21, 2019
 
 
The Hueneme Board of Education has directed that schools be 
prepared for any actual or anticipated disaster. E.O. Green 
Junior High School has a Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan (available in the school office) which meets district and 
state requirements. This plan is monitored and reviewed annually by the Sch
ool Safety Committee and is shared with 
faculty at least once per year. Emergency drills are conducted with students and staff regularly: fire and earthquake drills 
are done on a trimester basis, and lockdown drills are done twice yearly in cooperation wit
h Oxnard Police Department.
 
 
The safety plan includes disaster procedures, procedures for safe entry and exit of students, procedures for serious 
disciplinary problems, a sexual harassment policy, child abuse reporting procedures, school dress code, and sc
hool 
discipline policies. Safety procedures and elements of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan are reviewed by school staff 
at the start of each school year. Other methods of promoting school safety include campus supervision, many CPR
-
certified 
staff me
mbers, and a telephone and intercom communication system. Classrooms are equipped with first aid kits and fire 
extinguishers. We strive to maintain a safe and orderly school campus that supports a strong academic climate, and utilize 
the C.H.A.M.P.S. (Conv
ersation/Help/Activity/Movement/Participation/Successful Students) positive behavior system and 
a five
-
step discipline plan, along with behavioral interventions and restorative practices used to promote a safe campus.
 
 
Our safety plan was last reviewed and
 
updated in October, 2019. In our updated plan, we strengthened our procedures 
for safety during emergencies. We also provided teachers and students with information on the use of C.H.A.M.P.S. 
Positive Behavioral Support system, and on restorative practice
s.
