By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School Mission: The El Marino Language School staff and communi
ty are committed to the principle that all students can 
become functionally bilingual and bi literate during the elementary school years, while participating in a balanced 
educational program which promotes academic, social, physical and psychological grow
th. The school will foster and 
support creativity, inquiry, intrinsic rewards, individuality, self
-
discipline, a sense of personal worth, mutual respect, and 
an appreciation of different cultures
 
 
Program Goals: At EMLS, students will gain:
 
 
1. Language pr
oficiency in both English and the target language: Spanish or Japanese
 
 
2. Academic Achievement in both English and the target language
 
 
3. Positive self
-
esteem, cultural awareness and sensitivity
 
 
School Description: El Marino Language School (EMLS) is on
e of five elementary schools in the Culver City Unified School 

Spanish Immersion Program (SIP), founded in 1971, or the Japanese Immersion
 
Program (JIP), founded in 1992. In both 
programs, students learn the District curriculum as in other CCUSD schools, but most of the instruction is conducted in 
the target language, Spanish or Japanese. Currently there are 34 classrooms in SIP and 12 class
rooms in JIP. El Marino also 
serves as a site for the CCUSD Transitional Kindergarten program. EMLS serves 842 students: of these 24 participate in the 
TK class, which is an English program, 523 participate in the SIP and 264 participate in the JIP. El Mar
ino draws its students 
from the entire district attendance area; the school is ethnically diverse. About one third of the students speak a language 
other than English at home. While English is the primary language of most of our students, we have a wide ar
ray of home 
languages, though Spanish and Japanese are the dominant ones. English Learners comprise 22.2% of our student 
population; when factoring in the former English Learners who are now Reclassified as Fluent English Proficient, the 
percentage increas
es to 31% of our student population. El Marino is made up of a positive cultural diversity, which is one 
of it s most distinguishing features. El Marino has been named in the past as a National Blue Ribbon School and a California 
Distinguished School, and 
has also been recognized for excellence in Arts Education. Parents, students, staff and 
community members work together to contribute to the school's success.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The District provides a safe and clean environment for learning and growing. All sites have adequate classroom space, 
office facilities, libraries, and computer labs that support t
he instructional program. In 2007 El Marino benefited from the 
renovation of our school library, which doubled its size and added a media center to allow students to conduct research 
on the Internet. In the summer of 2018, the computer lab was converted in
to a new Makerspace Lab with new furniture. 
Summer 2019, a former office space of an alternative HS was newly remodeled to function as specialist room/Learning 
Center.  All sites have emergency plans in place with procedures for staff and students in case 
of fire, earthquakes, and 
other disasters. Emergency drills are held routinely. Staff members supervise all playgrounds during school hours. In order 
to ensure a safe environment at all sites, district security personnel monitor campuses on a daily basis. 
Maintenance is an 
on
-
going process provided by the district maintenance and operational department. All staff members have identification 
badges.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority
: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our leadership 
structures provide a multitude of opportunities for parents, staff and community members to work 
together to advance our school vision. Within each structure are focused efforts to develop certain features of the EM 
vision of bilingualism, bi
-
literacy and 
multicultural appreciation through a balanced educational program that promotes 
academic, social, physical and psychological growth. The School Site Council (SSC), a decision
-
making body comprised of 
five parents, three teachers, one support staff member a
nd the principal, meets bi
-
monthly to monitor the 
implementation of the goals to support student achievement in the SPSA and modify any goals or activities when 
necessary. All pertinent school decisions are made based on objectives articulated in our Site 
Plan, designed to 
complement the District LCAP. The English Learners Advisory Committee (ELAC), made up of parents, teachers and district 
staff, monitor the achievement data and articulate the needs of English Learners. They monitor the progress that El Ma
rino 
students are making toward meeting and/or exceeding state standards and recommend additional support services to the 
School Site Council as needed. EM parents also serve on the District ELAC committee, obtaining information and providing 
additional in
put for programs. Through collaborative efforts through the PTA, parent volunteers have plethora of 
opportunities to support initiatives that support integration of curriculum and community by bringing in their expertise 
and/or cultural knowledge to the fo
refront. As the name of our booster club states, Advocates for Language Learning El 
Marino (ALLEM), ALLEM supports our school by providing enrichment activities and providing parental groups to embrace 
and advocate Japanese and Spanish/Latin heritage and c
ultural opportunities. Stemming off of ALLEM, are 2 subgroups
-
 
Japanese Heritage Cultural Committee (JCHC) that advocates for Japanese Cultural Awareness within our community by 
bringing cultural workshops and funding to support program wide events. Simila
rly, Comite de Herencia Cultural (CHC) is 
the counter part, parents/guardians advocating for awareness for the Latin cultures.

underscores our belief that success comes by supporting the whole child. Community stakeholders, staff, and 

development in all areas.
 
 
Services to assist students include: one
-
to
-
one assistance by classroom teacher; individual assistance by paraprofessional; 
small group reinforcement within the regular day. Academic interventions help students gain proficiency in content 
standards. During
 
the day, flexible grouping and small group instruction can be observed in classrooms to help meet the 
needs of individual students. In addition, through district funds, an Intervention Support staff has been hired for intensive
 
intervention in English Rea
ding. Most of our teachers have been trained in providing differentiated instruction for our 
gifted students. Strategies such as compacting, challenge menus, depth and complexity, and higher order questions and 
activities help keep students challenged and 
stimulated. Teachers team in subjects such as language arts, where student 
instruction and accountability can be shared amongst grade level teachers. Teachers communicate student achievement 
using a common rubric and student groupings are kept flexible thr
oughout the year. Supplemental software supports 
direct instruction by teachers; differentiated practice is provided through the STMath and RAZKids programs, both web
-
based programs that can be accessed both at school and in the home.

With the keen unders
tanding that students learn best when their physical and emotional needs are met, EM has a variety 
of processes, both formal and informal, designed to identify, refer, and supply students w it h necessary support services. 
Some of these processes target al
l children, or groups of children, in an effort to identify any referrals. A Student Support 
Team (SST) referral process assists monitors student progress both academically and behaviorally. In addition, a school
-
site counselor is available 5 days a week f
or students who may benefit from social emotional support. Health screenings 
are provided in partnership with District nursing services and community based organizations such as the Lions Club and 
Rotary Club. Results of these screenings are immediately co
mmunicated to the parents by our District nurses, who are 
able to refer parents to available support services such as Culver City Youth Health Center and Venice Family Clinic, to 
provide free or low cost services. Parent volunteers from each classroom also
 
conduct monthly lice screenings to ensure 
a healthy and focused academic and social environment.

teaching, and/or debrief. Fortunately, our 
TLPs have taken advantage of being an alumni of COTSEN, and have been awarded several alumni
 
grants with focused 
work on understanding and implementing Word Work.
 
 
Culture and Equity: In collaboration with UCLA's Dr. Tonikiaa Orange, staff are building deeper understanding of culture 
and equity. In a 4 part series for this year, teachers explore 
how our own identify impacts the way in which we view and 
interact with students and how we include others in the sphere of success.
