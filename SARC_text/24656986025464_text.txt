School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School safety is of greatest importance in the Hilmar Unified School District. A safety program was developed with input 
from students, staff, and parents. The school safety plan is reviewed and updated on an annual basis and approved by the 
Elim School Si
te Council. Students and staff are trained on their responsibilities during emergency situations. Evacuation 
drills  and containment drills are held once per month. All visitors to Elim Elementary School are required to sign in at the
 
office and wear visit
or tags while on campus. Students may only leave the school with a designated adult on file if checked 
out through the office. Should a crisis occur we have counselors to assist students, parents, and staff.

Professional development at Elim has been driven by student and teacher needs as measured by various assessments 
(STAR, SBAC, ELPAC, local benchmarks) and surveys.  We have focused on research based instructional practices to deliver 
Common Core instructio
n. We have been providing balanced literacy instruction across all grade levels and have ongoing 
balanced literacy workshops for all teachers as well as new teachers.  We have provided opportunities across grade levels 
for professional development specific
ally in the area of writing and how we can support writing throughout our lessons.  
We have participated in G.L.A.D. and LDC training as well to enhance our program.  We provide ongoing training to 
teachers to learn how to integrate our ELA and ELD standar
ds.
 
 
Our teachers have also has participated in the Silicon Valley Math Initiative, ELM and Eureka math trainings.  Participants 
learn effective teaching strategies on how to instruct Common Core math.
 
 
Teachers have attended numerous workshops, conference
s, site and district professional development on research
-
based 
best practices.  Release time has been provided to each grade level for the development of Common Core Modules.  We 
have and continue to participate in PBIS training to improve our school clim
ate. We continue to participate in Evidence 
Based Practice trainings as well as Trauma Informed Practice trainings.  Staff have and continue to participate in partial/fu
ll 
day trainings to deepen their understanding of Evidence Based Practices, especially 
as it relates to students with special 
needs.
 
 
Each month we provide partial days for our grade level teams to meet and collaborate.  During these meetings, running 
records are analyzed and teachers collaborate to further develop units of study.  Additiona
lly, each trimester grade levels 
are given days to calibrate their student writing samples and discuss strategies to improve writing across their grade level.
  
We have taken full professional development days as well, to vertically analyze writing across a
ll grade levels to deepen 
our understanding of the expectations and what we need to do to improve our instruction.
 
 
Below is a breakdown of the Professional Development Days and who participated (full/partial staff).  Full participation 
indicates all staff
 
participated in the training.  Partial Staff indicates only part of our staff participated, those who it directly 
related to.  For example, all 7 Kindergarten teacher collaborate for a full day, but they are part of our full staff.  Additi
onally, 
we have 
multiple professional development activities on the same day (full and partial day), but we are only counting it 
as one full day.  For example, we may have a writing calibration day for the full day and our grade level meetings (Early 
Release Day) after th
at.  We are only counting it as one day.
