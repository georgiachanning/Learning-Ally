School Description
 
Mission Statement: Weibel is a school in which all children will learn in a supportive environment 
that values the individuality of each student.  The school strives to produce responsible citizens 
who
 
are not only well educated, but well rounded and active in the community.
 
 

-
performing schools in the district is no accident.  
Our community wholeheartedly agrees that each student should have a 
strong academic 
background, but also is extremely supportive of developing an awareness and appreciation of both 
the fine arts and athletics.  While staff members bear most of the responsibility for conveying 
grade
-
level standards and ensuring that student
s learn and master grade
-
level concepts, parents 
are quickly transitioning to a familiarity with the California State Standards and are supportive of 

-
level content.  After seven years at Weibel, 
studen
ts are extremely competent academically; have developed social and behavioral skills that 
enable them to be compassionate and work collaboratively; are knowledgeable and appreciative 
of music and art forms; and are skilled in athletics.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California 
public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are 
required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address st
ate and local priorities. 
Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC 
web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and community members should contact 
the school principal or the district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core cla
sses for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the Cali
fornia Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School 
Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The school was built in 1987 and is made up of clusters of modular classrooms.  There is a permanent multi
-
use building that serves as a cafeteria, 
auditorium, and gym.  The school has a large
 
paved play area, a grass field with two baseball/softball backstops, and a series of climbing structures within 
a tanbark area.
 
 
In 2015
-
2016 air conditioners were replaced or overhauled in 3 classrooms (6, 7, and 11). The track was leveled, its border re
placed, and the slope at the 
base of the grassy area to control erosion. The water heater in the kitchen was replaced.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey
 
called the Facilities 

ons you see on this report. 
Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of t
he date of the report. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

hool Site Council (SSC), the 
English Learners Advisory Committee (ELAC
), Technology Committee, and the Parent Teacher Organization (PTO).  They advocate for student 
achievement, enrichment activities, and building a community of well
-
rounded students.  Our PTO president, Sharon Kwok, can be contacted at 
president@weibelpto.o
rg.  The PTO Web site is a rich source of information for parents.  Weibel believes that the community is an important partne
r in 
education.  We are very fortunate to have a large number of dedicated parent volunteers who organize community events, run le
a
rning centers, monitor 
students at lunch recess, shelve books, file papers, and attend field trips.  Their participation allows the teachers and sta
ff to focus on the needs and 
education of the students.  We can only estimate, but our parents volunteer ten
s of thousands of hours cumulatively each year.  In addition, they run 
alongside their children in the Wildcat Run, join with teachers on the SSC, and participate in Family Math/Literature/Science
 
nights, Spring Carnival, and 
Multicultural night.  Weibel c
an truly boast a successful and highly involved PTO.  The nearly 800 members raised money to fund the many educational, 
enriching programs offered to the student body.  They also fund technological purchases and upgrades, the purchase of literat
ure books, 
and the purchase 
of additional instructional materials to provide a more thorough education for all students.
 
 
The high level of involvement of both staff and parents shows that our students are valued by all members of the school commu
nity.  We help build
 
their 
self
-
esteem through the Student of the Week program.  Our applause is heard at the variety shows, academic contests, band concerts
, and basketball 
games.  Several of the teachers attend the extracurricular activities of their students.  Teachers oft
en tutor struggling students on their own time.  We 
watch the students grow and follow their progress as they move through the grades, often meeting with their current teachers 
to offer advice and 
monitor their development.  We encourage them to return aft
er they have left our school and keep us informed of their achievements.  The Weibel 
community does not lose sight of our vision or forget that our purpose as teachers, parents, administrators, and school staff
 
is to assist and nurture these 
students as th
ey grow and develop.  Weibel students are not just our responsibility for a year; they are a part of our lives forever. To fi
nd out how you 
can volunteer at our school, please contact the classroom teacher or the principal's office.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Staff, parent volunteers and our safety patrol stud
ents monitor the school grounds and student drop
-
off and pick
-
up areas for 15 minutes before and 
after school.  Weibel has a safety patrol coordinator teacher to facilitate and organize safety patrol students during the sc
hool year. Teachers supervise 
at a
ll recesses, and noon supervisors and the principal supervise at lunchtime.  Teachers regularly review the rules for safe, re
sponsible behavior in school 
and on the playground.  We have a closed campus that is fenced with limited access.  Visitors must sig
n in at the office, where they receive a visitor or 
volunteer badge to wear throughout their stay.  Weibel uses a software program that tracks all of our visitors on a spreadshe
et.
 
 
The Weibel School Safety Committee, comprised of teachers and the principa
l, revises our School Safety Plan annually.  It was last revised on October 
18, 2019.  The Safety Committee meets four times a year to review and update the School Safety Plan.  The plan includes proce
dures for emergencies,

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. 
 
Below is the amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
2017
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations these days a
re sometimes reduced.
