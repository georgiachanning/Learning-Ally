This year we will continue to be s
haped by our efforts to ensure that each student will be able to compete in a global economy.  Our 
accomplishments have been monumental and we will continue our focus on teaching and learning so that our students graduate co
llege, 
career, and community rea
dy.  While maintaining the implementation of the initiatives already in place, we will focus on addressing 
targeted social and emotional needs and attendance of every student.  We also plan to enhance staff support and development i
n core 
content areas, au
gment individual and small group student support with additional tutors in our school.  Hence, our school wide theme, 
#ROYAL STORY!  The theme of story will be incorporated into curriculum in numerous ways as we investigate how each of us has 
our own 
perso
nal narrative, how stories enhance empathy and understanding, and how stories passed down create history.  Story has a natura
l 
relationship to language arts, and reading but also to each discipline including word problems in math, the story of a scienc
e ex
periment 
and the story of a work of art or a piece of music. I know that we can meet all of our initiatives because we have staff that
 
believes in the 
promise of educational excellence.
 
 
To our parents, I do not need to remind you of how important your job
 
is for our children at Palm School.  Your students need your wisdom 
and your care.  My hope is that through our invigorated Professional Learning Community, both you and our students will think
 
of our 
school as a place where community of learners come tog
ether to do interesting consequential work.  I hope that you attempt new things 
this year and that you challenge your students with hard and interesting questions.  We, Palm School staff, will continue to 
provide the 
infrastructure and human capacity to su
pport you to make great things happen.
 
 
In closing, I know each of us wants to make a difference in the lives of our students. I am confident that we will blaze a tr
ail filled with 
success and accomplishment as, together, we launch the best year yet for Pa
lm Elementary School. I look forward to a year filled with 
stories of great success and great learning.  Thank you for your commitment to your child's education and I look forward to s
eeing each 
of you.
 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condit
ion and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annua
l school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Components of this plan 
include child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, 
procedures for safe arrival and departure from school, sexual harassment policy, and dress code policy. The school's most rec
ent sch
ool safety plan was 
reviewed and updated by school staff in August 2019. Staff responsibilities and safety plan updates were discussed with staff
 
in August 2019. Additionally, 
we ensure our school and grounds are safe. The staff monitors our campus before,
 
during, and after school, and maintains monthly FIT (Facility Inspection 
Tool) reports. We strictly enforce an assertive discipline plan, keeping fighting and bullying to a minimum. We have an adequ
ate number of playground 
supervisors during recess, and w
e routinely review playground safety rules with students. We conduct fire, earthquake, and emergency drills monthly. 
We implement PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention Support) at our school. We emphasize positive reinforcement and good choice
s.
