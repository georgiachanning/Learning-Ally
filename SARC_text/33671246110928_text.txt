School Description
 
Seneca Elementary School is located on the western border of the city of Moreno Valley.  Located 
in a middle to upper
-
middle income area of the city, it serves students from families of both blue 
and white collar employment.
 
 
Seneca has been designated a P
roject Moving Forward Demonstration School by our district.   Our 
students are exposed to a wide range of academic vocabulary within this program.  Our students 
identify part of speech, syllabication, reading comprehension, and make use of evidence based 
l
iterature.  Our students write with a rubric at hand and make use of Thinking Maps and other 
Graphic Organizers to assist them in their compositions.  Seneca was recognized with the Golden 
Bell Award in 2017 as well as The Models of Academic Excellence Awa
rd (2017) due to the diligent 
implementation of Project Moving Forward by all Seneca Elementary staff.
 
 
Seneca is also fortunate to have a city
-
sponsored after school program to provide tutoring and child 
care for working parents, entitled THINK TOGETHER. 
 
Our students participate in a range of 
academic and physical activities as they wait for their parents.  Homework assignments are 
completed within this time
-
frame in order to assist students with questions they may have 
regarding academics.
 
 
Seneca has th
ree Non
-
Severe Special Day Classes (SDC) that provide services to special needs 
students in grades K
-
5.  We also have one full
-
time RSP teacher who provides services to students 
with Individualized Education Program goals.
 
 
We are committed to the followin
g:
 
 
 
MISSION:  To prepare children to become functionally literate, productive, and responsible citizens 
in our society.
 
 
 
VISION:  To be a cohesive and collaborative learning community with integrity where all are focused 
on student learning of essential 
outcomes to ensure student success.

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible s
tudents 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We believe that student achievement and success are based upon a strong parent and community partnership. Therefore, Seneca S
chool not only 
encourages parental and community involvement, but also provides a wide varie
ty of activities that allow for direct parental and community participation.
 
Parents, as members of the Parent Teacher Association (PTA), enrich the quality of our school climate. Our PTA and parent vol
unteers support and 
promote the following: Fall Festiv
al, Red Ribbon Week, safety programs, library support, disaster preparedness, teacher and classroom support, Family 
Reading and Math Nights, school spirit days, special assemblies, field trips, Read
-
Across America, which provides students with academic inc
entives, and 
this year they are sponsoring thirteen after school enrichment clubs for our students.
 
 
Community involvement includes support from area businesses and civic organizations in academic programs and student recognit
ion activities.
 
The School Sit
e Council (SSC) meets several times a year and provides a forum for input on matters of curriculum, budget, support programs,
 
and special 
services and needs. SSC members have been valuable in providing input for our School Plan.
 
 
The English Language Progr
am Council (ELAC) provides a forum for parents of students who participate in our ELD programs. ELAC members provide 
input regarding our Limited English Proficient programs, discipline guide, and budget expenditures. A branch of our ELAC comm
ittee members 
have
