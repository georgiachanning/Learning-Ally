FROM THE PRINCIPAL
 
 
Welcome to the Mary Buren Elementary 
Annual School Accountability Report Card (SARC). Every 
school in California is required by state law to publish a school
-
specific SARC, by February 1 of each 
year. The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public 
school. We appreciate you taking the time to read our SARC and become better informed about 
our school.
 
 
At Mary Buren Elementary, we believe preparing students for college and career readiness begins 
as early as Transitional Kindergarten. As an AVID Eleme
ntary school, we teach students, early on, 
fundamental learning, study, and academic behavioral skills. Our dedicated and highly qualified 
staff takes great pride in authentically knowing every student to ensure they thrive as learners. 
 
 
Our vision is to 
provide every Mary Buren Elementary student the academic and social
-
emotional 
foundation for college and career readiness and success in a global society. To ensure this, we:
 

 
Commit to a safe and engaging learning environment.

Hold high academic and social
-
emotional expectations for all students.
 

 
Build positive relationships with students, families, and the community.
 

 
Provide rigorous, innovative, teaching and learning enhanced with arts, science, and technology.
 

 
Value families as partners in providing the 
best possible educational experience to our students.
 

 
Collaborate to review data, share teaching and learning strategies, and continually grow our practice.
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Acco
untability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data report
ed in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, 
Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Guadalupe Union School District sets a high priority upon ensuring that sufficient and current textbooks and materials are av
ailable to support 
instructional programs. As
 
a result of the site visit on September 3, 2019, pursuant to the Williams Settlement, Guadalupe Union School District had zer
o 
findings and was determined to have (1) "sufficient" standards
-
aligned instructional materials in four core subject areas, (2) f
acility conditions that do 
not "poses an emergency or urgent threat to the health or safety of pupils or staff", and (3) the schools provide accurate da
ta on the annual school 
accountability report card related to the sufficiency of instructional materials
 
and the safety, cleanliness, and adequacy of school facilities.
 
 
All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects, 
health, and visual and performing 
arts for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks in all subject areas are aligned with the California Content 
Standards and are selected from the state's most recent list of standards
-
based materials. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adop
ted according 
to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making textbooks used in the school the most current availabl
e.
 
 
The table displays information collected about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned t
extbooks and other instructional materials 
used at the school.

School Facility Conditions and Pla
nned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Built in 1974, Mary Buren Elementary School is situated on nine acres.  School facilities span 67,600 square feet, and includ
e 42 classrooms, a library, 
computer lab, cafeteria, administrative offices, restrooms and sto
rage rooms.  The November 2016 election addressed the need for a school facilities 
bond, allowing for the construction of 8 new classrooms at Kermit Intermediate School. The facility strongly supports teachin
g and learning through its 
ample classroom and p
layground space.
 
 
In 2019, Guadalupe Union School District was award a Full
-
Day Kindergarten Grant for three (3) million dollars. The grant funds will be used to construct 
five (5) kindergarten classrooms. The project is designed to provide a secure 
kindergarten section on campus with designated play areas as separate 
entrances and exits for kindergartners. This will result in an overall increase of two (2) classrooms since three (3) classro
oms will be removed during the 
construction.
 
 
Developers are 
constructing a new housing development within the city.  During the course of the next few years as the new (800) homes are b
uilt, it is 
estimated that 448 new students will enroll in our district.  It is estimated that each new residential unit will gener
ate 0.6 students for grades kindergarten 
through eighth grade.   Until the new housing development is complete and a new junior high school is built, adequate facilit
ies will continue to be a 
challenge. The Guadalupe Union School District participates in t
he State Financial Hardship program which provides assistance for districts that cannot 
provide all or part of their local share for a School Facility project.
 
 
Future planned projects include upgrading of bell and intercom system; expansion of buzzer and 
camera system for entering main building; installation 
of water hydration and drinking fountains; and roofing.
 
 
MAINTENANCE REPAIR
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of the Maintenance and Operations department. District maintenance supervisors ar
e proactive and conduct 
inspections at school sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working are complet
ed in a timely manner.  A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency and saf
ety related repairs are given the highest priority.

CLEANING PROCESS AND SCHEDULE
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district.  All schools are cleaned daily. 
A summary of these standards is 
available at the
 
school office of the district office. The site administration team works with the maintenance, custodial and operational staf
f to develop 
preventative maintenance and cleaning schedules to ensure a clean, safe campus.

School Safety Plan
 
Mary Buren Elementary School is a closed campus.  Two crossing guards are present on Peralta Street and 10th Street to help a
ssist walkers to cross 
onto 
campus. All visitors are required to sign in and to wear visitor badges during their stay.  School resource officer is presen
t on campus, classrooms, and 
playgrounds. During lunch, recess breaks, and before and after school, campus safety, the princip
al, dean of students, outreach consultants, and teachers 
supervise students and school grounds, playgrounds, and including the cafeteria, to ensure a safe and orderly environment.
 
 
The comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the district to comply 
with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997.  The plan provides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment.  Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 withi
n their safe school plans; 
current status of school cr
ime, child abuse reporting procedures, disaster procedures, routine, and emergency policies related to suspension and 
expulsion, notification to teachers, sexual harassment policy, provision of a school
-
wide dress code, safe ingress and egress of pupils, p
arents, and school 
employees, safe and orderly school environment, and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and updates it as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Pla
n, are reviewed with 
school 
and District staff throughout the school year during various safety training opportunities and emergency drills. The plan was
 
last updated and reviewed 
with the school staff in January 2019.
