By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Valley View Charter Montessori is a transitional kindergarten through seventh grade elementary school located in El 
Dorado Hills, 18 miles east of Sacramento in the 
Sierra foothills. Our beautiful campus creates a positive learning 
environment for children with its buildings situated among open green spaces and many stately oak trees. Built to 
completion in 2013, Valley View Charter Montessori opened its doors to stud
ent in 2017
-
18.  In 2017
-

an enrollment of 520+ students and had a waiting list in most grade levels. This current year, 2019
-
20 we have added 8th  
grade and have 750 students with 37 Teachers.
 
 

 
encourages, and provides opportunities for the involvement of staff, parents, 
and the community in school and District decision
-

the Montessori Charter petition to respond to identified,
 
expressed needs from parents and students within the District.  
The program began in the 2004
-
2005 school year by serving Kindergarten students on the Blue Oak Campus.  Grade levels 
were added the following 10 years and in 2017 the school moved to Valley 
View.   The Charter Montessori School follows 
the instructional methodologies, standards, and educational direction established within the Buckeye Union elementary 
District respecting the Montessori philosophy and utilizing Montessori materials and learnin
g strategies.  In addition, the 
Charter Montessori School/Program, in utilizing the Montessori methodology, will incorporate core sections in Practical 
Life, Sensorial Materials, Language, Mathematics and Cultural Subjects.  Valley View Charter Montessori 
also hosts a 
Montessori pre

school operated by the El Dorado Country Office of Education
 
 
Inclusion of all students is a high priority for us.  Special Education students are mainstreamed to receive a balanced 
curriculum in the least restrictive environmen
t. Both staff and parents pay close attention to subtle changes in our 
students that may indicate a need for additional support and assistance. Our community is generous and caring in an 
atmosphere where cooperation and respect is highly valued. We have ta
ken specific action to implement the Common 
Core State Standards along with the Learning Center model for our SPED.  All of our grade level through the development 
of a comprehensive standards based report card that holds both students and teachers account
able for specific academic 
achievements.
 
 
At Valley View Charter Montessori we have high expectations for student achievement.  We are committed to providing 
students with a solid academic background in a safe and supportive environment.  We challenge stud
ents with academic 
curriculum that requires them to apply skills and knowledge to meet district standards.  Our intent is to build an academic 
foundation that will allow students to be successful in middle school, high school, and beyond.
 
 
The newly renova
ted and updated campus added a Band Room, Middle School Girls and Boys Locker Rooms, 3 additional 
classrooms that are used for Middle School.  We added a fully functional STEAM Lab that is next to our library.  Our library 
has one of the finest literature 
collections in El Dorado County with a strong addition of young adult literature for out 
middle school students. .  Students in all classes meet with the library assistant weekly to choose age

14 Chromebooks and a scattering of  iPads in each room. . This year, our PTO helped our school district in purchasing 
Chromebooks for more classrooms to continue piloting and utiliz
ing this new technology. For example, the PTO bought 
two sets of virtual reality goggles that have classroom curriculum embedded within them.  It is called ClassVR and we have 
a team of teachers that are trained and and now are training our other teachers.

(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved

however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula

scores.
