School Description
 
Our mission statement states: We are a community of professionals whose core purpose is 

learning and success while enriching and encouraging positive, power
ful, and purposeful thinking.
 
 
The Levi Dickey staff has internalized the Mission Statement through the implementation of three 
main programs.  One is we are a No Excuses University.  NEU is our overall school culture that guides 
how we do business at Levi
 
H. Dickey Elementary School.  Being a No Excuses University school 
means that we focus on six exceptions systems: a culture of universal achievement, collaboration, 
standards alignment, assessments, data management, and interventions.  As part of these 
ex
ceptional systems, we routinely implement a Response to Instruction (RtI) twice a year.  In this 
process, we review the progress of every student on campus to ensure their individual academic 
and behavioral needs are met.  On a weekly basis, we ensure our 
teachers participate in 
Professional Learning Communities (PLC).  During these weekly meetings, teachers are given the 
opportunity to do grade
-
level and vertical articulation.  In addition, they focus on the 10
-
12 
essential standards that the district has 
approved for their grade level where teachers plan their 
lessons and assessments around.  Lastly, teachers utilize PLC time to analyze student data to make 
necessary course corrections in their lesson delivery and tier 1 intervention that occurs daily in t
heir 
classrooms.  Another program that we focus on here at Levi H. Dickey Elementary School that 
supports the six NEU exceptional systems, is AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination).  
The AVID program provides our teachers with various college read
iness strategies that focus on 
writing, inquiry, collaboration, organization, and reading.  To ensure positive student behavior is 
focused upon; which is the last program that we implement at Levi H. Dickey Elementary School, 
we have implemented Positive B
ehavior Intervention Supports (PBIS).  PBIS allows a school
-
wide 
focus on promoting positive student behaviors, as well as, provide students that are in need of 
more intensive behavioral supports the opportunity to partake in opportunities that are tailore
d to 
their individual needs.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
On October 3, 201

 
textbooks 
and instructional materials have been provided to students. The Board of Education adopted Resolution 2019/2020
-
18 which
 
certifies as required by 
Education Code 60119 that (1) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials have been provided to each student, including 
English learners, that are 
aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with the cycles and c
ontext of the curriculum frameworks in the following subjects: 
history/social science, mathematics, reading/language arts, and science, (2) sufficient textbooks or instructional materials 
were provided to each pupil 
enrolled in foreign language and/or heal
th classes, (3) laboratory equipment was available for science laboratory classes offered in grades 9
-
12, inclusive.
 
 
Textbooks and instructional materials are provided for each student for use in class and to take home. It was determined that
 
each pupil i
n each school 
has sufficient textbooks and instructional materials that are aligned to the academic content standards in the core subject a
reas for the 2019/2020 school 
year. Additionally, sufficient textbooks and/or instructional materials were provided t
o each pupil for visual and performing arts.*Please note: In 
reference to materials not from a most recent State Board Adoption (SBE): In November 2017, the California State Board of Edu
cation approved a list of 
History/Social Science programs for district
s to consider for their new adoption. CVUSD elected to continue to use current District adopted materials 
while further studying program options provided on the SBE list to consider for a future piloting process. CVUSD reviewed cur
rent District adopted 
mat
erials and determined that they meet current history/social science standards.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Chino Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) makes it a priority to maintain safe, clean, and effective school sites for our 
students, staff, and parents. The 
safety of students is of p
aramount importance to CVUSD. In the morning, staff supervision is provided to watch the cafeteria, entrance gates, and 
playground activities. During lunch and recess times, noon ground supervisors and teachers monitor students to ensure student
s interact 
safely. At the 
end of the school day, staff supervises student dismissal. The staff and student workspaces for this site are cleaned on a re
gular basis by the school site 
custodial staff. In addition to regular cleanings, deep cleanings are scheduled and c
arried out during breaks and vacation periods. The school facility is 
adequate and has sufficient classrooms, playgrounds, and staff spaces in order to operate efficiently. A recently completed s
chool improvement for this 
site was the schoolwide keyless ac
cess system completed in the 2018/2019 school year and the schoolwide security camera system planned for the 
2020/2021 school year

To ensure sites are clean, safe and functional, Maintenance and Operations department staff conduct inspections at the schoo
l sites on a continual basis. 
School sites may also enter maintenance requests by accessing the School Dude system. After the school site request is entere
d into the system, a work 
order is generated, and the Maintenance staff works diligently to complete 
all work orders in a timely manner.  The Maintenance team utilized the Facility 
Inspection Tool (FIT), a survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction (OPSC), 
to record inspection results.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority:

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
