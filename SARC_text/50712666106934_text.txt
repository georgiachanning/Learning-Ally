 School Accountability Report Card
 Reported Using Data from the 2018
-19 School Year
 Published During 2019
-20   By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
   For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.  For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.  For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
  DataQuest
 DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).  Internet Access
 Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-come, first
-served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

   School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-20)
  Our vision at Sisk Elementary is that all students can learn at high levels when instruction meets their needs.
  Sisk Elementary opened in the fall of 1987; consisting of several portable cla
ssrooms.  Enrollment in Salida was growing 
rapidly and Sisk became a permanent school site in summer of 1994; it was surrounded by a subdivision which housed a 


teach each child the skills necessary for life
-
steadfastly committed to achieving our mission each new school year; employing a variety of strategies and maximizi
ng 
existing resources to support student success.
  One of our key resources is the collective experience and constancy of the teaching staff.  Several staff members have 
taught in Salida for over 20 years.  Our academic program maximizes our people and fis
cal resources, recognizes and 
addresses the needs of our diverse population, and focuses consistently on student learning.   Parental support is a 
significant element; we enjoy the full benefits of an active Parent Teacher Group which provides our families
 opportunities 
for involvement in school events.   We believe in the value of providing children a well
-rounded educational experience 
which includes a comprehensive social/emotional skills program, music program, physical education program, S.T.E.A.M. 
ins
tructional days, exposure to the fine arts, access to technology, assemblies, and field trips.
  Our goal at Sisk Elementary School is that all students achieve at high levels. Sisk Elementary is an educational community 
of teachers, parents and community m
embers who collaborate to provide students with a balanced education.  Our goal 
is to ensure that every student reads independently and meets grade level standards by 3rd grade.  Professional Learning 
Communities engage in ongoing evaluation of student pro
gress and achievement to refine the instructional program so 
that students can achieve academic proficiency.    Intervention for students who are performing below grade level is 
provided during school hours. Students access the core curriculum in English L
anguage Arts, ELD, Mathematics, Social 
Sciences, and Science using state
-adopted curriculum programs.  The staff members at Sisk School are proud of our

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., 
California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/
literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California St
ate University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school's Safe School Plan is designed to provide Sisk families an orderly and purposeful place where students and staff 
are free to learn and teach without threat of physical, emotional, or psychological harm.
  
Each year our Site Safety 
Committee reviews the safety plan and makes necessary revisions.  The Plan is then reviewed by the School Site Council 
and site staff and is presented to our School Board for their approval.    During the school year our safety 
committee 
conducts quarterly site safety inspections and our findings are submitted to the District Safety committee.  Our District 
Safety Committee, inclusive of the site administrator, meets quarterly to review site safety matters and monitor needs as 
st
ated in the inspection reports.  A copy of the Sisk Safety Plan is available at our District Office for public review and  on
 
the district website at https://www.salida.k12.ca.us/domain/1589.

The key elements of our School Safety Plan include:  Preparedne
ss for emergency and natural disaster, awareness of the 
school's physical and social environments, and expected characteristics of a safe school and school culture.  These 
elements are reviewed in a staff meeting with school personnel at the beginning of t
he school year.  Parent/Student and 
Teacher handbooks are prepared and distributed to staff and students for their review on the first day of each school year.  
Throughout the school year we practice emergency procedures, including fire drills, earthquake 
preparedness drills, and 
lock
-
down drills per school year.  At staff meetings throughout the school year we review safety procedures such as proper 
yard duty techniques and playground (safety) rules and their enforcement.  Sisk is in the first phases of ad
opting the 
Positive Behavior Intervention System to address the social/emotional needs of students and to develop a community 
culture built on shared expectations and language (Respectful, Responsible, and Ready).

To date we have not had any limitations to purchasing materials or providing extra time and services to students who are 
low performing. We will continue to utilize and maximize all resources and staff in 
providing additional support to low 
performing students. LCFF and special education funds will be budgeted to meet the needs of under
-
performing students.
 
 
Our school has many resources available to assist our students. These resources include: a Learning 
Support Team lead by 
the Learning Director and paraprofessional support personnel; special education aides, site school counselor; elementary

taff;

reading intervention from a credenti
aled teacher. Curriculum includes but not limited to Benchmark Advance Reading,
