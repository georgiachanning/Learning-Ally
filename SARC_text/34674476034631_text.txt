By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

based activities lead to conceptual development 
in language arts, math, science, and social studies. Writing across the curriculum helps students develop reading, writing, 
listening, and speaking skills to be better 
critical thinkers and problem solvers. The mathematics curriculum we've adopted 
allows all students access to instructional materials that are Common Core aligned. 
 
 
Technology is integrated into classrooms through computers on wheels. Students master word
 
processing and conduct 
research to reinforce curriculum under the supervision of their teachers. All rooms have cable and wireless internet access 
to enrich the curriculum. The school's wireless internet access has been updated, enhancing the ability to d
o research in 
their classrooms. Teachers integrate technology into their instruction and use LCD projectors to assist in their instruction.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
August, 2019
 
 
San Juan Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2019 and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the Sta
te of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. 
Textbooks and supplementary materials ar
e adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the
 
School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the qu
ality, currency, and availability of 
the standards

aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. If you would like more information 
on the textbooks and instructional materials please visit our website: http://www.sanjuan.edu/Page

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Thomas Kelly was modernized over the summer of 2019. The school received new carpeting, new tile floors, new furniture 
throughout the school including the library and the MP room.  News curtains were
 
added in the MP room for the theater 
arts program. The playground and the parking lots were re
-
surfaced. A professional development room was furnished to 
provide an area for staff training. In the main hallway, a glass wall was added with a buzzer in the 
front office to unlock 
the door with the press of a button.
 
 
Thomas Kelly Elementary School was last modernized during the 1999
-
2000 school year. The scope included: roof/repair 
or replacement, interior, and exterior painting, selected window system replac
ement, energy
-
efficient heating and cooling 
system, new lighting, new doors with handicapped accessible hardware, restroom restoration, energy management 
system, anti
-
graffiti coating, electrical infrastructure upgrade to provide for internet, cable, telep
hone, fire, intrusion, and 
intercom system. Asbestos floors were replaced. Carpet was added to classroom space. The front of the school has been 
re
-
landscaped, and a fence has been installed to ensure safety of the students. Currently, there is sufficient 
space to house 
the student population. There is a site custodial staff that cleans the building, along with district support for major/minor
 
repairs. The district provides gardening and landscape services on a regular schedule. Regular monthly fire/emergen
cy 
drills are held, and badges are required for all visitors and personnel. Local bond funds were used to replace portable 
classrooms during the 2005 school year. In 2006 under the Deferred Maintenance Program the hardcourt was overlaid. In 
summer 2008 the
 
parking lot was overlaid along with safe routes improvements funded by Measure
-
J Bond. In summer 
2015, wrought iron fencing was installed around the perimeter of the school.
 
 
The Board of Education and the Superintendent's policy is to ensure that all stu
dents are provided with a safe and well
-
maintained learning environment. The board approved resolutions in 1998 and 2002 to adequately fund maintenance 
activities and preserve the repairs and improvements funded by two facility bond measures. The school bu
ildings, 
classrooms and grounds are safe, clean and functional. An inspection of the facility was conducted in August 2019 and 
determined that there were no unsafe conditions that required emergency repairs. District maintenance staff ensures 
that the repa
irs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
computer automated work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs and health and 
safety repairs are given the highest p
riority. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards and custodial staffing 
requirements for all schools in the district. This school meets the Board's standards for custodial staffing and cleanliness.
 
The school's custodians are trained in the p
roper use of cleaning chemicals and Integrated Pest Management techniques. 
They are managed day to day by the Principal with assistance from the district's maintenance department. The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, 
with funding allocated for major repair or replacement 
of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. Annually the distric
t budgets $2 million dollars for deferred 
maintenance activities.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of stu
dents who met the standard (i.e., 
achieved Level 3

Alternate) 
on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculat
e the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement

Professional development is a key part of the continuous improvement process for educators. The goal of our quality 
professional development is to support the learning of teachers and paraprofessionals to positively impact student 
achievement.  Annually, t
eachers and site administrators participate in professional development in a variety of 
opportunities.  Seventy
-
five minutes per week are dedicated to staff collaboration and training planned by site leadership 
teams. The District also provides a cycle of 
continuous professional development for Administrators through Principal 
Networks as well as Leadership Academies.
 
 
The District provides professional development opportunities for teachers and administrators that support the 
implementation of Common Core 
State Standards in English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and the 
ELA/ELD Framework.  Specific professional development initiatives include: Culturally Responsive Practices, Critical 
Literacy, TK
-
2 Reading, Supporting Independence and
 
Engagement through Reading and Writing, Math to the Core, 
Expository Reading and Writing Course, and ELD Foundations.  District departments, Center for Teacher Support, grant
-

ing opportunities.  Professional 
development opportunities are voluntary for teachers and are provided throughout the year in a variety of formats: during 
the school day, after school, on Saturdays, and during summer and vacation breaks. Many teachers and 
administrators 
also take advantage of opportunities with Sacramento County Office of Education, California Department of Education, 
the college/university programs, state/national education organizations, and private educational institutes.
 
 
What grounds t
he professional development in the district is the District Strategic Plan and the Local Control 
Accountability Plan. Professional Development is further determined using one or more of the following: (a) student 
achievement data, (b) staff survey data, an
d (c) district
-
identified goals.  Professional development addresses the Common 
Core State Standards, teaching strategies, curriculum, assessment, technology, classroom management, safety, and 
leadership. Administrator training accompanies professional dev
elopment in district focus areas, providing 
implementation support for teachers on site.  Content
-
area coaches are available at some schools.  Additional classroom 
support is provided to new and struggling teachers by consulting teachers from the Center fo
r Teacher Support.
 
 
Paraprofessionals are encouraged to participate in professional development at the district and site level.  Specifically 
designed training is also offered to non
-
instructional support staff such as clerical and custodial staff that inc
ludes both 
operational and instructional topics.
