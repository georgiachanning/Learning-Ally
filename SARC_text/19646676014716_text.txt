School Description
 
 
Thinkers, Doers, Coders, 
Leaders!
 
 
Mariposa Computer Science Magnet School is dedicated to prepare students to be critical and 
innovative thinkers, demonstrating perseverance as they problem solve to develop the skills 
needed to be successful in a rapidly changing technical world.
 
 
Our school is a place where staff, parents, and community are dedicated to the intellectual, 
personal, social, and physical growth of students where honesty, perseverance, and compassion 
are fostered. Our highly qualified staff recognizes the value of pr
ofessional development and 
collaboration in order to rigorously challenge students. Our teaching practices are both reflective 
and responsive by providing multi
-
tiered system of supports to meet the needs of our students. We 
are a PBIS Gold Award school, A
VID certified, and are partners with Code To The Future.
 
 
Computer Science, coding, and robotics are infused into student learning to enrich the educational 
experiences enabling them to discover their potential and achieve readiness for college and 
technol
ogy careers in a safe and caring school environment. Mariposa Computer Science Magnet 
School is partners with Code To The Future. This partnership provides a computer scientist once a 
week to work with teachers and students in the use of Scratch block base
d code. Students use block 
based code to create animations to support core subject learning. Students learn to code LEGO 
Robotics, Ozobots, Speros, and HTML Web Design, Our school provides three parent showcase 
events where students proudly share their pro
jects with parents.
 
 
All students TK
-
6th grade participate in programming with Scratch block based code. Students have 
1:1 technology and many of our classrooms use Google classroom to support student learning and 
collaboration. Students may check out Chro
mebooks and hotspots for use at home to support 
Google classroom assignments.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
General
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the Los Angele
s County Office of Education. The results of this survey are available at the school office or at the district office.
 
 
School Buildings
 
Mariposa was built in 1959 and modernized in 2005. Mariposa is a beautiful campus with large mature trees that shade tw
o large quad areas. The campus 
enjoys a large grass field with a baseball diamond. The main office area houses administration and health services. The schoo
l has a clean and orderly 
library that supports literacy. The multipurpose room and cafeteria serve 
breakfast and lunch every day. There are 31 classrooms and a staff development 
room for professional development and professional learning communities work.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the s
chool in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The district governing board has ado
pted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the district office. 
The Supervisor of Operations works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe sc
hool.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
Although the State no longer requires a Deferred Maintenance contribution, Lancaster School District is still dedicated to ma
intaining the facilities for 
our students.  These expenditures would include but not be limited to roof
ing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical, painting, and flooring.  For 
the 2019
-
20 school year, the district has budgeted $940,000 for deferred maintenance projects.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
Sta

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which inclu
des the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. O
nly eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities
); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
