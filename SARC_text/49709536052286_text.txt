By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
We update our school safety plan every fall through our School Site Council (SSC) and then review with the staff. Our plan 
covers emergency procedures, staff responsibilities, dress code, child abuse reporting, sexual harassment, discipline, and
 
school rules. Prestwood schedules school wide emergency drills monthly and train on emergency procedures multiple 
times throughout the year.  In addition, our school district has hired on a consultancy agency to review our safety plans 
and ensure that sta
te regulations are met.   Furthermore, the SSC is planning a safety event in late February or early March, 
where Prestwood is going to be implementing the steps that are outlined in our Safety Plan.
 
Our discipline policies are based on the district
-
wide pr
ogressive discipline model, which are restorative in nature, and 
minimizing exclusionary practices. Teachers post Prestwood School rules in their classrooms, and teach behavior 
expectations in various school settings. Our rules are designed to ensure that 
students are safe, respectful, and 
responsible. Prestwood Elementary is implementing Tier 1 of Positive Behavioral Intervention & Supports (PBIS). 
Prestwood has a referral process for students making behavioral errors which is restorative, informs parents,
 
and builds 
relationships between staff and students. Prestwood has a positive incentive for acknowledgments (Blue Cards).
