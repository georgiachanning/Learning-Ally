Description
 
Foskett Ranch.....a place where Falcons soar!
 
 
At Foskett Ranch Elementary School students learn essential skills and knowledge to successfully 
progress towards college and career readiness.
 
 
Foskett Ranch opened its doors to 360 students in Au
gust 2005 and has grown to about 450 
preschool through 5th grade students.  In addition to quality instruction based on high standards 
for achievement, our focus has been to build positive school and community relations. Staff and 
parents organize family n
ights, festivals, and events to honor various achievements. Since the 2008
-
2009 school year we have continued our journey towards developing our school as a Professional 
Learning Community (PLC), a group that continually collaborates to seek answers to the
 
questions
-
 
What do we want our students to know? How will we know they have achieved the objectives? 
What will we do when students do not achieve the objectives? What will we do when students 
advance beyond the objectives? This results
-
based, student
-
cent
ered process focuses our 
instruction, intervention, professional development and plays a major role in our success. In 2010, 
we received state recognition as a California Distinguished School.  The positive energy, 
collaborative spirit and devotion of adul
ts on campus towards student achievement make Foskett 
Ranch a wonderful place to learn and grow.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

At the district level many professional development opportunities are available for staff development including positive beha
vior support strategies, and 
strategies/techniques to address the needs of English learners and students with special needs, GATE c
ertification, math,  language arts, and Next 
Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Four district instructional coaches work individually and with grade levels to assist in
 
the areas of English language 
arts, math and science.  Two of the coaches also assist
 
schools to implement the English Language Development Standards (ELDS) to gain an 
understanding of designated and integrated English Language Development to implement in the classroom.  At the site level tea
chers collaborate in 
grade level teams to design
 
English language arts units that align with literature, social studies, science, English language development, technology and
 
the arts. This year, three grade levels work with an outside consultant to participate in a deep study of the state math fram
ewor
ks and the standards to 
design lessons and units that address the rigor of the math frameworks.
