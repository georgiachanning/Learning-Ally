Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Wilson Elementary School has an updated school emergency and disaster preparedness plan that encompasses: fire, 
earthquake, chemical accident, bomb threat and dangerous 
intruder on campus (lock
-
down).  The district and the school 
uses an online emergency alert system called Catapult to notify the district and site safety teams, staff and emergency 
personnel of incidents and emergencies. The plan outlines the responsibilit
ies of each staff member and the procedures 
to follow per the emergency.  The safety plan was Board approved in March of 2019 following the local school site's 
approval and input in February of the same year.  A copy of the safety plan is available for man
ual review in the front 
office.  Our emergency phone tree is updated regularly and earthquake, fire, and lock
-
down drills occur monthly.  All staff 
members, certificated and classified, have received training regarding our school
-
wide emergency and disaste
r 
preparedness plan and ongoing discussions occur regarding student safety for the classroom, playground, and cafeteria.  
Crossing guards, bus supervision, and noon duty supervisors are also in place and an emphasis is placed on bicycle, 
pedestrian, and tr

installed around the school site and there is a clear procedure for guest check
-
in and check
-
out at the main entrance of 
the school.

Types of Services Funded
 
(Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
In order to support the diverse academic needs of all of our students, we have funded 2  full time intervention teachers 
that provide explicit, targeted ELA instruction in the following areas: decoding, fluency, comprehension, and 
writing.  
These students were selected based upon assessment data and progress is monitored weekly using formative 
assessments.  These groups are fluid which allow for students to exit the intervention once mastery has been made. All 
students at Wilson Ele
mentary School will also be administered fluency and comprehension benchmark assessments three 
times per year and students progress will be closely monitored using I
-
Ready Assessment Data. Our intervention teachers 
are funded out of LCAP, Title I, and Titl
e II funds.
 
 
Instructional aides are also part of our Wilson Community and support our second grade, third grade, special education 
students, and our tier 2/tier 3 intervention students.  Our instructional aides work with students in small groups and 
provi
de additional support to students in the area of ELA.  Our instructional aides are funded out of Title I and Title III 
funds.
 
 
Instructional materials and staff development is provided for our English Language Development (ELD) teachers and 
funded out of T
itle III.
