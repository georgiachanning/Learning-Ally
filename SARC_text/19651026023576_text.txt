By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Leona Valley ia an urban
-
rural community located in the Antelope 
Valley approximately 90 miles northeast of Los Angeles. 
The community is a very diverse one. Many of the area residents are in a wide variety of professions including aircraft 
construction, agriculture, transportation, and allied people service. Numerous r
esidents commute to the Greater Los 
Angeles area for employment. Edwards Air Force Base, Rockwell International, and Lockheed Aircraft Company are within 
close proximity. However, some people living in Leona Valley work as seasonal workers and laborers.
 
 
F
ounded in the early 1960's Leona Valley currently serves about 80 students in grades kindergarten through sixth grade. 
Leona Valley School is a small rural school that is more like an educational family. The staff consists of 4 highly qualified
 
teachers, 1
4 classified support staff, and shared administrative staff working together with parents to provide a positive 
nurturing learning environment for students in grades kindergarten through sixth grades. Our greatest initiative is to 
provide the leadership th
at will facilitate a school environment which provides differentiated instruction to meet the 
needs of each student to the best of our ability. The educational program must be academically challenging, engage each 
student by linking the curriculum to previ
ous knowledge and experience, and also be exciting to promote further 
exploration of new ideas. Parents, teachers, support staff, and administration all have an important role to encourage our 
students to become active learners. It is our sincere desire to
 
provide expanded opportunities for our students to acquire 
the skills to become productive citizens in a vastly changing society. At Leona Valley School we pride ourselves in being 
able to maintain quality home

-
based), school psychologists, school nurses, specialists in 
Speech/Language/Hearing, adaptive physical education teachers, or behavior specialists.

Twelve counselors provide a range of support services for Westside students.  Programs and services are developed and 
provided based on student data (such as referral
s for threatening or self
-
harm behaviors and academic intervention 
letters) and the needs of the school site.  Often these programs build upon the skills and habits of mind that are nurtured 
and developed in Leadership Development through Physical Educatio
n (LDTPE), AVID, and Boys Town.  Examples of 
counseling programs include specific groups for strong
-
willed students, grief groups, groups for students who are 
exhibiting signs and behaviors due to trauma, academic organization groups (addressing academic o
rganization of 
assignments, goals, and expectations), and community outreach and service clubs such as Student Ambassadors or 
Kindness Club. School counselors are assisted by a cadre of Campus Climate Assistants, highly trained paraprofessionals 
who provid
e social emotional support and structure for students during more unstructured parts of the school day like 
recess and lunch. Counselors and Educational Service staff members collaborate regularly with community agencies to 
facilitate alignment and coordin
ation of resources and supports for students and their families.
 
 
The district continues to collaborate with the Department of Mental Health to coordinate with local mental health 
agencies to provide School Based Mental Health services at all school sites 
for eligible students.
 
 
Behavior specialists provide student and staff support for students needing intensive behavior support and/or 
intervention.
 
 
Bilingual paraprofessional support staff provide assistance in the classroom for English Learners. Bilingua
l assistants 
receive ongoing professional development in the areas of strategies to support students learning English within the 
classroom; review of district wide academic programs supporting English Learners; specialized language practice used for 
transl
ation during parent/teacher conferences; protocols for English Learner identification; and criteria for student 
reclassification.
 
 
Several programs, designed to build students' emotional intelligence and capacity and to promote positive and proactive 
socia
l decision making, reduce bullying, and build an inclusive culture continue to be implemented districtwide. Two of 
these are BoysTown (implemented in grades Kindergarten through 8) and Leadership Development through Physical 
Education for students in grade
s 4, 5, and 6.
 
 
A variety of online mathematics (i.e. Big Brains and ALEKS) and reading intervention (i.e. FastForWord) programs are 
accessible for students.  In addition to being used during the school day, students can also access these programs from 
hom
e.  These online interventions are site
-
specific.
 
 
A variety of extended learning opportunities like before/after school tutoring and/or lunchtime Learning Lab support were 
offered at all sites.  Learning Labs provide support with homework and opportunitie
s for collaborative learning sessions.  
Tutoring may provide review of foundational skills, frontloading of key skills and concepts, and/or homework assistance.  
Five days of intersession support is provided for middle school students during each spring an
d summer intersession.  An 
Extended School Year program is available during the first part of summer intersession for those students with disabilities 
who qualify.  A traditional district wide summer school program was on hold for the summer of 2018 due to
 
significant 
maintenance and repairs at school sites. In lieu of the summer school program for elementary students, optional 
interactive Summer Learning Kits were purchased for parents and caregivers to use with their students over the summer 
intersession.
 
The Kits contained games, tools, and materials to sharpen and support reading, writing, and math skills.  
Additionally, the district offered its third summer KinderCamp during the summer.  The three
-
day experience was designed 
to provide an opportunity fo
r incoming Kindergarteners and their parents to learn about Kindergarten expectations in a 
day camp

type environment.

Westside Union School District offers on
-
going professional learning and training opportunities for teachers, 
administrators, and para
-
educators.
 
 
The goal of professional learning is to provide staff 
members the support that they need to meet the diverse educational 
needs of Westside students. The key area of focus for professional development and support for the 2018
-
2019 school 
year was the use of assessment data, particularly common formative assess
ment data, to guide and inform instruction.
 
 
Teachers, classified instructional classroom support staff, and site administrators are provided four days of professional 
development each year. These days are calendared work days.  For all groups, two of the 
days are dedicated to issues and 
needs related specifically to our English Learners, foster youth, or other at
-
risk students.  For teachers and site 
administrators, two of the four days are devoted to building their capacity to use data, particularly forma
tive assessment 
data, to inform instruction.  For classified instructional staff, two days were devoted a to a variety of topics including 
trauma
-
informed support for at
-
risk youth; BoysTown; Leadership Development through Physical Education; and meeting 
t
he academic needs of students with exceptional needs.
 
 
Teachers are also encouraged to engage in optional professional learning opportunities that relate to their specific 
teaching assignment. Teachers are compensated at a contractual hourly rate for their
 
participation in these sessions.
 
 
Similar opportunities are provided for our site administrators.  Most regularly attend applicable ACSA Academies.  70% of

Professional learning opportunities are provided through a variety of formats including  conference/institute attendance,

district training delivered by consultants and or district 
staff members with release time for teachers, staff meetings, 
and individual and small group coaching.  Curriculum Resource Teachers, under the direction of the Director of Curriculum 
and Instruction, provide much of the individual and small group coaching
 
support.  This is especially true in the area of 
integration of classroom technology tools to support teaching and learning.  During the 2018

teacher leaders served as instructional coaches at the school sites.  These site

Instructional administrators meet monthly
 
to share best practices related to areas of instructional focus and leadership 
for meaningful change in educational systems.  All instructional administrators are encouraged to (and supported in)

five years of teaching experience.   The 
district has developed a robust system for new teacher support including 1:1 support, Professional Learning Communities 
(PLCs), and direct classroom support. New teachers are assigned a mentor/coach dependent upon t
heir credential status. 
Support providers, mentors, and coaches in the program are veteran teachers who have been released full
-
time from their 
classroom responsibilities.  Every new teacher is supported weekly at their site by their mentor/coach with the 
focus of 
support being aligned to their goal and individual support plan.  Full time administrators/coaches also support the pre
-
interns and interns based upon the requirements of their university's memorandum of understanding and the 
requirements of the C
TC.  The pre
-
intern and intern teachers participate in biweekly professional development based 
upon the district initiatives as well as their unique developmental needs.  Teachers holding a Preliminary credential are 
supported by teachers on special assign
ment who serve as full time Support Providers.  Those holding a Preliminary 
credential attend a series of six professional development opportunities specially designed and aligned with the California 
Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTPs). For veter
an teachers needing additional support, the Peer Assistance and 
Review (PAR) program is designed to improve the education of students by providing opportunities for additional training 
for all teachers.
