By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-

each student.  Through teamwork and collaboration we have build a school community that supports all s
tudents reaching 
their full potential.  At Sunset Ridge we believe that all students can learn and that all students can exceed the high 
standards set by the teachers and administration. All teachers and staff are dedicated to building a community of learn
ers. 

literacy, a well balanced curriculum, student support systems, and community and family involvement. Our school culture 
is committed t
o using best practices in teaching all students; collaboration between staff, parents, and the community; 
and to meeting the different academic and developmental needs of the whole child. Sunset Ridge has developed an 
outstanding learning environment that 
promotes critical thinking. The parents and staff are dedicated to helping Sunset 
Ridge students shine. Excellence through Diversity is our motto.
 
 
Sunset Ridge has extensive technology throughout the school with one computer lab for Transitional Kindergar
ten through 
first grade.  We have 5 computer carts for 2nd and 3rd grades. We are one to one with chromebooks in 4th and 5th grades.  
Students are able to do a wide variety of activities on the computers that support 21st Century skills and academic 
develo
pment. In addition to the labs and carts, teachers have technology in their that they use to engage students in 
learning.
 
 
Sunset Ridge has established a welcoming and caring community by incorporating community building events throughout 
the school year. 
One of our cherished  monthly activities is "Family Day". This is a very successful program where one child 
from each grade level is placed in a school family. The 5th grader is the facilitator of the activity and helps their "family
" 
get to know each othe
r. This not only enhances the sense of community at our school, but students learn leadership skills 
at the same time. We also get together as a whole school each Monday morning to share information and to celebrate 
things that are going well. We have an o
utstanding student leadership program. Our Student Council consists of 2 students 
from each classroom in 4th and 5th grades. Students meet on a monthly basis and plan activities. In the past,  students 
raised over two thousand dollars for Pennies for Patie
nts, the American Heart Association, and for UNICEF. I am very proud 
of the students and impressed with their leadership skills and dedication to our community. Parent involvement is key to 
student success. It is our goal to continue to increase parent inv
olvement and enhance our community spirit.
 
 
We have a variety of programs that meet the needs of all children. We have a music program for all students. TK
-
2 graders 
are provided music at least once a week through Rhythm and Moves. . Our 3rd through 5th gr
ade students receive music 
through the Pacifica Education Foundation (PEF). We also have a science teacher that provides hands
-
on science 
experiments for grades 2
-
5th grade. We are very excited about our Foreign Language in Elementary Schools (FLES) 
progra
m that provides Spanish to students K
-
5th grade two times per week and an additional session on the computer.
 
In addition to our Spanish program, we have an outstanding art program supported through a grant from Sanchez Art 
Center. This program 
provides an artist and teacher for all of our students TK
-
 
5th grades. Our 4th and 5th graders also 
have PE with a certificated PE teacher to support them with the general PE program that is happening everyday.

We have an active PTO that organizes activit
ies and raises funds for field trips, assemblies, and other great programs that 
focus on the needs of our children. The PTO supports after school enrichment activities like Chess Club, Yoga, Stem, Poetry 
Club, and martial arts club. We also have  Spindrift
 
School of the Performing Arts at Sunset Ridge. They provide a variety 
of  drama and dance programs after school. We have a wonderful Room Parent program that provides the continuity 
between the PTO and the classroom. They organize our annual book exchange
 
program, our annual Pancake Breakfast 
basket auction, and support our teachers each and every day.There are numerous ways to help out  and make a difference.
 
 
Sunset Ridge has a full time counselor. The counselor works with children and families in 
order to support the child through 
social skills groups or individual counseling depending on individual needs. Family services are also provided. The 
counselor  is resource for families and can put families in contact with community services. Services can
 
be provided after 
school as well.
 
 
We have a wonderful outdoor classroom called " The Oversea". The Oversea is a deck that was build in the shape of a 
whale's tail and looks over the city of Pacifica and the Pacific Ocean. Classrooms use the Oversea to do
 
observations, as a 
place to write, as a place to learn our about our environment as well as watch for migrating whales. The deck was built 
through the PTA and community support in a truly collaborative manner. We are lucky to have a community that values 
educating the whole child. We also have a vegetable and flower garden where students are encouraged to get their hands 
dirty as they learn. We have added an additional garden at the front of the campus with support from Recology of the 
Coast and Healthy Pl
anet.

A Sunset Ridge team consisting of administrators, teachers, staff and parents came together for a two day Parent 
Engagement Learning Institute designed to build the capacity of the school team to develop, implement and evaluate 
family engagement practices 
that lead to increased academic outcomes. At the Institute the team learn to align family 
engagement practices with School Plan for Student Achievement and LCAP goals and priorities and to develop, implement 
and evaluate family engagement practices as prof
essional learning community. The team meet for follow
-
up meetings to 
execute the plan, evaluate their practices and develop additional actions.
 
 
Parents and community volunteers are a valued asset at Sunset Ridge. The PTO supports our academic and enrichme
nt 
programs, as  well as the social emotional learning of children. The PTO has identified field trips for all children as their
 
priority. Our wonderful parent volunteers have opportunities to volunteer in the library, classrooms, serve as room 
parents, se
ll nutritious snacks after school, book fairs, school events, gardening, support academics in the classroom, and 
a variety of other ways.  We have a strong school community whose members, parents, teachers, and staff, serve on the 
School Site Council and E
nglish Language Advisory Committee.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Sunset Ridge we build a community of learners where children are safe to take risks and learn from their mistakes. We 
have a team of teachers and administrators that have been trained in PBIS and have worked with the staff to develop 
school wide rules t
hat focus on positive behaviors and focus on being problem solvers, always kind, willing to try, and 
staying safe. We have an anti
-
bullying pledge that clearly articulates appropriate behaviors. The entire schools takes the 
pledge when we celebrate "Stomp 
Out Bullying".
 
 
We have a campus that is secure and ask that all visitors check in with our school office to sign in and wear a yellow name 
badge. We revise our School Safety Plan annually  and conduct monthly emergency drills and maintain emergency 
suppli
es, including food and water. The district also conducts an extensive emergency drill with the help of the Pacifica 
police and fire departments. Because we are located in earthquake territory our safety procedures focus on what to do  
during and following 
an earthquake. Drills also include instructions for evacuating buildings, search
-
and
-
rescue scenarios, 
and communication procedures. After each drill we conduct  informal evaluation of procedures and evaluate what went 
well and what do we need to address. 
The School Safety Plan is reviewed, updated, and discussed with the school faculty 
annually.

a menu of options that included sessions focused on Restorative practices, Readers and Writers workshop, Inclusive 
Practices, Design Thinking and Behavioral

to monthly staff meetings dedicated to staff development, we al
locate staff development days during the year so teachers 
can meet within grade

level teams to plan units of study, review data, and plan lessons. We also had a team made up of 
teachers, counselor, and administrator attend year 2 of PBIS.
 
 
The Instructiona
l Leadership Team meets on a monthly basis and examines the school's data and plans interventions 
programs for students.  We have found that English Language Arts and vocabulary development are areas to focus on. 
The Literacy Committee meets regularly to p
lan professional development for the staff for Writing and Reading Workshop 
and plans the Family Reading Night. The Math Committee also meets on a regular basis and reviews data and plans 
professional development for each grade level. The committee has dev
eloped key academic vocabulary words that are 
essential to each grade level and planned Family Math Night. The first PD of 19
