By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State p
riority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with
 
alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requireme
nts for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

The Parent 
Teacher Association (PTA) actively promotes and sponsors activities that benefit the children of La Cañada 
schools. PTA meetings are held monthly and all parents are invited to attend. Informative programs on a wide variety of 
topics are presented at these
 
meetings as well as at other times throughout the year. Some of the PTA activities involve 
volunteers who devote time such as classroom volunteers, library and computer lab aides, resource people, clerical aides, 
drivers, room representatives or other sch
ool volunteers.
 
 
Parents should contact the teacher or room representative to find out how they can help. School volunteers must sign in 
at the school office when they arrive on campus. Parent volunteers must have a current TB test on file in the school's 
main 
office. Parents who go on overnight field trips must be fingerprinted. Parents can ask in the office to learn of the 
procedures for TB testing and/or fingerprinting. The PTA facilitates communication between the school and home through 
regular email u
pdates and flyers sent home with students.
 
 
The PTA President and Executive Board members are listed on the PTA website. Parents should contact them if they would 
like to volunteer or have questions and/or suggestions about PTA programs and activities. Fun
ds raised at PTA activities 
are used for curriculum materials, playground equipment, computers, library books, art materials, assemblies, PE 
equipment and many other ways.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
Through the support of the district administration and the cooperation and efforts of the special 
education and general 
education staff, children with exceptional and special needs are receiving appropriate educational services. All students 
with special needs are placed into an appropriate educational setting and receive special support either directl
y in the 
general education classroom or in a special education classroom.  Students qualifying for special education services have 
their Individual Education Programs (IEP) monitored by IEP Teams comprised of the school psychologist, a special 
education st
aff member, the child's classroom teacher, parents and an administrator or designee. Parents of special 
education students are encouraged to participate fully in developing their child's individual educational plan.
 
 
Gifted and talented students are identi
fied yearly in grades three and above. Programs for GATE students include pull
-
out 
weekly instruction and after school enrichment. Emphasis has been placed in areas of mathematics, science and critical 
thinking skills at the elementary sites.
 
 
The home lan
guage survey is used to determine the primary language for each student in the district. Students with a 
language other than English are assessed to determine their English language proficiency. If appropriate, students are 
provided instruction in English 
language development. Students with the greatest need also receive additional ELD support 
in the regular classroom and in small group settings.  The district and school staff monitor students' ELD progress through 
the school year.
 
 
Through funding from the
 
PTA and District, a Reading Intervention Program is provided to elementary students who are 
in need of additional support in the area of reading. The program begins in September of each school year and ends in 
April. Students participate in the program be
fore or after the school day. Phonics and comprehension skills are the target 
areas for instruction.
 
 
La Cañada Unified School District is fortunate to have active parents and community who contribute generously to the 
schools. The Education Foundation has
 
contributed over $2,000,000 annually to the district in the last three years. These 
funds are used to reduce class size, contribute to full
-
time counseling services, fund the district librarian and provide art, 
drama, and music instruction to all students
 
in grades TK 
-
 
6 and optional Spanish classes in grades 3 
-
 
6. These funds also 
contribute to district
-
wide technology and after school enrichment programs.

During the past three years the primary areas of focus for staff development at LCUSD have been the implementation of 
Common Core State Standards (CCSS) in Math and Next Generation Science 
Standards (NGSS) and training for special 
education teachers through the SELPA. Special Education staff attend 2
-
3 days of staff development during the year 
sponsored by the Foothill SELPA.  We have also paired experienced teachers with teachers who are ne
w to the LCUSD for 
mentoring and instructional support.  The annual number of days have varied from 4
-
10 days depending on teacher needs. 
Newer teachers require more days of professional development to obtain knowledge and skills necessary to implement 
the
 
new standards and the strategies that prepare students for college and career. Additionally, all teachers have been 
provided with the opportunity to attend trainings/conferences outside of the district.
 
 
The District has continued to work with organizatio
ns called, Teachers Development Group, to provide support to the site 
administration with evaluation and monitoring of the implementation of the new strategies. The District has also been 
working with the K
-
12 Alliance at WestEd to provide NGSS training to
 
teachers and administrators.  Due to ELA adoption 
in grades K
-
6, trainings have been provided to the teachers in those grade levels by the publisher to ensure smooth and 
effective implementation of the new textbooks/materials. Teachers have been piloting 
NGSS aligned materials and have 
been trained by the publishers to appropriately use the materials during the piloting period.
 
 
Eleven half days in grades 1
-
6 and five full days in kindergarten have been provided to teachers for collaboration 
throughout the
 
year. This time has been used to share best practices, design CCSS aligned lessons and projects, create 
common assessments, etc.
 
 
Training sessions have been provided within the district by Technology Integrationists in the areas of instructional 
technolo
gy, new assessments, CCSS aligned report cards and digital citizenship. Grade level and team leaders in extra
-
duty extra
-
pay positions also provide support to all teachers. Online workshops and trainings have additionally been 
provided to certificated and 
classified staff through Kennan and Associates and Alliance of Schools for Cooperative 
Insurance Programs (ASCIP).

Above and beyond regular trainings provided to all teachers, specialized training has been provided to Special Education 
teachers to address
 
the specific needs of students in Special Education. Several Crisis Prevention and Intervention 
workshops have been provided throughout the past three years to allow the teachers and paraprofessionals to work 
effectively with students with severe emotiona
l and social needs. Teachers and paraprofessionals successfully completing 
the training are certified for two years. Special Education teachers and service providers have received training on 
developing Individualized Educational Programs (IEPs) that provi
de educational benefit for students.
 
 
The Peer Assistance and Review Program as well as the Teacher Assistance Mentor Program have provided mentors for 
teachers who needed support in specific areas based on evaluations. Principals and colleagues have provi
ded support 
through staff meetings, teacher
-
principal meetings, peer observations, classroom walkthrough feedback and modeling of 
CCSS aligned lessons by teacher leaders and Technology Integrationists.
 
 
LCUSD administrative team is granted a stipend for pr
ofessional growth activities and has benefited from the opportunity 
to enroll in advanced level college courses and Association of California School Administrators (ACSA) academies. The 
District has provided sexual harassment training for all management le
vel positions and held monthly leadership team
