Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

based learning and field trips. Stege students are 
capable learners, therefore, our academics are rigorous, standards
-

and needs.

School Facility Conditions and Pla
nned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school us
es 
the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance
 
staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The school p
ersonnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achi
evement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entranc
e to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of the School Site Safety Plan is to provide a unified template for school sites to respond and 
recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the disruption of normal school operations.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan guides a coordinated school staff response to an emergency, disaster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response acti
vities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over time and those that may occur without warning.
 
 
The objectives of the School Site Safety Plan are as follows:
 
1.
 
Protect the safety and welfare of students, school staff, and visitors.
 
2.
 
Provide for a safe and coordinated response to emergencies.
 
3.
 

 
4.
 
Enable the District to restore normal conditions with minimal confusion in
 
the shortest time possible.
 
5.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between sites and the District Emergency Operations Center (DEOC).
 
6.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between the District EOC and the Cities of Richmond, El Cerrito, San 
Pablo
, Pinole, Hercules, and Contra Costa County Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
 
7.
 
Provide for the orderly conversion of pre
-
designated District sites to mass care sites, when necessary.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is updated annually.  Our school sa
fety plan was last annually reviewed, updated, 
and discussed with school faculty and a student representative in January 2020.  A copy of the Comprehensive School

At Stege School, we recognize that continued student success requires consistent growth among staff members. Our staff 
development focus is on effective planning and quality instruction in all curricular areas. Teachers meet
 
3 times per week 
to collaborate on student data, instructional practices, and effective planning in the areas of RLA, ELD, Math and 
Technology. In addition, 10 full staff Professional development days are led by the Principal, and Lead teachers and Distri
ct 
and Community partners to focus more in depth on school wide needs in literacy, trauma
-
informed practices, math, 
science, and technology. Our Apple and Connect Ed team lead a full staff Professional Development sharing current 
practices utilizing our Ap
ple products. In addition, our Literacy Lead teacher attends professional developments to dive 
deeper into the application and best practices of utilizing our current reading and writing curriculum. We are focusing on 
specific practices related to both ELA
 
and math aligned with the California Standards for Teaching Practices. We have also 
additional training in Sanford Harmony Social Emotional Learning curriculum, Restorative Justice Trauma Informed 
Training, Mindful Life Practices, Classroom Management Str
ategies, and STEM. We have a district Mathematics Coach for 
teachers in grades 1
-
6 as well as a District Science Coach for teachers in grades 4
-
6. In addition to PD and Coaching on
-
site, our district curriculum and instruction department frequently offer a
 
variety of training, during and after school. The 
administration team informs and encourages all teaching staff members to participate in professional development 
opportunities.
 
 
The school has 5 full days of professional development meetings for teachers
 
to attend. These meetings are scheduled for 
the 5 full days before students begin the school year. There are also 5 days of professional development that are non
-
student days.
