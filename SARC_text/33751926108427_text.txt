By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
TVUSD's Maintenance and Operations division works diligently to ensure our facilities are clean and safe for students, 
teachers and staff. The district follows
 
a comprehensive preventive and deferred maintenance program to offset costly 
repairs and minimize disruptions to the instructional program. Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices 
and bathrooms are clean and well maintained. The District'
s elementary and middle schools each have one full time lead 
custodian during school hours. In order to respond to work requests in a timely manner, the district utilizes an electronic 
work order system. When a site secretary, custodian or administrator ha
s a request, they can put it into the system 
directly. This makes for a more time efficient processing of work orders.
 
 
Temecula Elementary School has a total of 37 classrooms. In addition, the school has a multipurpose room, a library, 
computer lab, 
and an administration building. The main campus was built in 1968. In 2003/04 Temecula Elementary School 
underwent modernization work, removing 14 portables and replacing them with a 15
-
plex wing which opened in 2004/05.  
During the summer of 2014, wi
-
fi w
as installed campus wide, SmartBoards were added to the 4th and 5th grade 
classrooms as part of Measure Y.  Additionally, exterior doors and locks were replaced, making all exterior doors lockable 
from the interior.  Exterior doors were all repainted.  The
 
flooring in the workroom in the multi
-
plex (Kinder, 1st, and 2nd 
grade building) was replaced.  Maintenance and Operations replaced carpet and painted the 5th grade pod in 2014.  
Kitchen equipment has been updated. During the summer of 2017, the multi
-
pur
pose room was modernized it and the 
platform replaced, two classroom buildings were modernized and re
-
roofed, and the administration building and library 
were modernized.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they receiv
ed a score or not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School safety is a high priority for our school and district.  Our School Site Safety Plan is a comprehensive plan that 
encompasses all disaster preparedness procedures and emergency plans. It also addresses everyday 
procedures and 
standards that ensure the safety of students on campus. This plan is updated and approved annually by the School Site 
Council in December. After approval by the SSC, it is presented to staff at a regularly scheduled staff meeting.
 
 
Our schoo
l is a closed campus that is fully enclosed by fencing.  School visitors and volunteers are required to sign in at 
the front office using the Raptor system prior to entering campus.
 
 
A copy of each School Site Safety Plan is also maintained by the Temecula
 
Police Department. Officers can access every 
TVUSD School Site Safety Plan via laptop computers in their cars. Our School Wide Safety plan was last reviewed and 
updated in March, 2019 and continues to remain current.
 
 
To better prepare our teachers, stude
nts and staff for emergencies, our school conducts emergency drills regularly 
throughout the school year. Education Code mandates that all elementary schools hold a fire drill each month they are in 
session as well as an earthquake drill at least four time
s during the school year.

District Commitment to Learning for All Students
 
 
The Temecula Valley Unified School District is committed to ensuring that each and every child in its care receives a 
rigorous, multifaceted 
educational experience preparing them for the demands of college and career.
 
 
TVUSD teachers engage in active staff development throughout the year by attending:
 

 
In
-
District training sessions provided by staff and consultants.
 

 
Site
-
based training sessions 
presented during staff meetings and committee/grade level meetings.
 

 
One on one training provided during formal observations and post observation conferences.
 

 
Staff members are sent to conferences to fine
-
tune instructional practices in specific areas.
 

 
Teac
hers with specialized training are given opportunities to train their peers, and provide instructional support 
as teacher leaders.
 
Standards Based Instruction
 
 
Staff development focuses on implementing the State Standards and state frameworks in 
English
-
Language Arts, Science, 
social science, and Math, K
-
12. Routine district sessions bring teacher leaders and principals together to devise and refine 
the curriculum and assessments. Teams began by identifying priority and supporting standards, group
ing the standards 
into units of instruction, and crafting common interim and summative assessments, developing scoring rubrics, and 
discussing sound grading practices for each course/grade. Leaders return to sites to facilitate their grade level/course 
tea
ms in reviewing the work, suggesting resources, and providing feedback for the refinement committees.
 
 
Collaborative Teams
 
 
Teachers are divided into Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) based on content area and grade level. All 
instructional staff pa
rticipate almost weekly during professional growth time meeting in their PLC groups to align 
curriculum, refine teaching strategies, create assessments, analyze student achievement data and transition to New State 
Standards.
