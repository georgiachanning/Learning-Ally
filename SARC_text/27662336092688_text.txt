School Description
 
 

 
 
Toro Park Elementary School focuses on the unique social, emotional, and academic needs of 
students in grades TK
-
3. The curriculum at each grade level includes reading, spelling, writing, 
mathematics, science, social studies, health, physical education, a
rt, and music. The specific 
instruction at each level is based on the California State Standards for that particular grade. 
Teachers plan learning activities that build on the interests and extend the skills of young learners. 
They use a variety of materia
ls and creative teaching strategies to motivate the students and to 
make learning fun and challenging. Field trips, guest speakers, and special assemblies are 
curriculum related and help connect concepts learned in school to life outside the classroom. 
 
 
T
he school serves approximately 380 students in Transitional Kindergarten through third grade, 
with a school wide average class size of 24 students. Toro Park School provides a Transitional 
Kindergarten program, to serve children who need the gift of time t
hat is essential to becoming 
more confident as they move to the next level of academic achievement. The Transitional 
Kindergarten program has a comprehensive curriculum that meets the needs of the child at a pace 
adapted to best suit their abilities. Skill
s are addressed in social development, attention and 
concentration, and academics. This class functions as a true transition between the child
-
centered 
curriculum of preschool and the academic expectations of elementary school. Transitional 
Kindergarten st
udents must turn five years of age between September 2nd and December 2nd. The 
expectation for students enrolled in this class is that students will attend a regular kindergarten 
class the following year.
 
 
Academic learning is the primary focus of the scho
ol. Other areas, however, are also emphasized. 
Students at Toro Park learn the importance of getting along with peers, as well as learning 
appropriate social skills, practicing self
-
control and tolerance, working hard and feeling pride in a 
job well done, 
and developing civic responsibility. These are all important life lessons that are 

education programs adopted by the school site. 
 
 
Each grade level receives addit
ional instructional support from instructional assistants. Students 
from the Toro School for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing located on campus are mainstreamed into 
the Transitional Kindergarten, kindergarten, and first grade classes with interpreters. Studen
ts with 
disabilities are included in grade level classes, with support provided by the Learning Center staff. 

classroom or in the Learning Center. School based counseli
ng services are available for students 
who are struggling socially or emotionally.
 
 
All students participate in the Art Docent Program, which is organized on a District level. Each class 
receives one hands

on art lesson and one picture of the month lecture
 
each month, presented by 
parent volunteers. Each year in May student art is displayed at the District Art Show. 
 
 
Toro Park students participate in a Dance Festival each year, which is organized by each grade 
level.
 
 
Additionally, each grade level has one per
formance during the year that incorporates singing, 
dancing, and/or drama.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The District selects textbooks in a cooperative effort with the three schools in the District. During the year, a committee c
omposed of teachers and an 
administrator, examines all the State
-
approved textbooks in a content area. 
The textbooks are evaluated on their alignment with the California State 
Standards, their appropriateness for the District, their clarity, the teacher support materials, and their instructional appe
al. Once the committee has 
made a recommendation, the Dist

 
 
Once the District adopts the textbook, each student receives a copy of the book. The District has affirmed that every student
 
has access to their own 
textbooks and instructional
 
materials for use in the classroom and to take home. In addition, the newly adopted text books are available online for 
student and parent use.

School Facility Conditions and
 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The first building at Toro Park School, the current Administration, and Media Center Building, was constructed in 1974. Since
 
then, the school has added 
a permanent kindergarten complex (in 1992), and three permanen
t buildings (in 2004) that each contain six classrooms.
 
 
The school facilities provide students with an updated, pleasant learning environment and classroom internet access. The enti
re school site is 
handicapped accessible. Located in a suburban setting, t
he school abuts the hills of the Fort Ord National Monument, which in the springtime provides 

ooks for each student on 
campus. Proc

designed for 3
-
5 year olds was installed in November 2011. This playground i
s a joint effort with the Toro School for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing and 
Toro Park School to serve the needs of preschool and kindergarten students. The buildings and grounds are attractive, clean, 
and safe. The community 
Pony League Association maintain

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smart
er Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Toro Park School has a comprehensive volunteer program, which enables parents and community members to support the school in 
many ways. 
Volunteers help in the classrooms, library, and wherever needed. They prepare learning materials, chaperone fie
ld trips, plan celebrations and special 
events, share a special interest or hobby, or serve on various committees. Approximately 75 volunteers assist with classroom 
activities. Additionally, 
the standards based art program is run entirely by parent volunte
ers.
 
 
They do everything from teaching hands on art projects to presenting Picture of 
the Month art history lessons in the classrooms.
 
 
 
School Site Council (SSC) is composed of parents and school staff. The School Site Council meets six times per year to 
monitor the implementation of 
the Single School Plan for Student Achievement and discuss issues pertinent to the school site and District such as the LCFF,
 
LCAP, and the Strategic 
Plan.

Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Students attend school in a safe and orderly environment. The
 
school maintains a closed campus, and students are carefully accounted for and checked 
in and out through the front office. Gates are locked during the school day to keep unauthorized individuals from entering ca
mpus without first checking 
through the sch

 
 
Students are supervised during lunch and recess times by school staff.
 
 
Staff members also monitor student behavior at arrival and dep
arture times. Many procedures are implemented to ensure safety as students move from 
place to place on the school site. The students are also instructed in bus safety and participate in monthly classroom evacua

Safety Plan wa
s last reviewed and modified in January 2020 to reflect accurate descriptions of room evacuation routes, and individual respo
nsibilities in 
times of emergency. The plan includes procedures for emergencies, ranging from an intruder on campus to an earthquak
e.
 
 
The school staff reviews the plan each year and then practices emergency procedures with the students throughout the duration
 
of the school year.
 
 
Several school staff, including the health aide, have received first aid training. Student emergencies ar
e handled quickly and appropriately. Parents are 
contacted immediately if their child sustains a serious or head injury and, if necessary, 911 is called.
