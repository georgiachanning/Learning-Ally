By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE
 
Welcome to Oakview Community School! We strive to provide every student with a positive experience and the necessary 
supports to reach his/her maximum potential. Our 
instruction is personalized to meet the needs of each student.
 
 
We work to ensure all staff are implementing effective instructional strategies, integrating technology and utilizing 
assessment data to actively engage each student. This is measured by each 
student's personal growth and the total 
percentage of students demonstrating proficiency. Teachers meet collaboratively to evaluate assessments and use data 
to plan instructional, targeted interventions and goal setting. Our ongoing goal is to develop and 
implement a 
comprehensive, ongoing cycle of learning for students and faculty. This year, staff development continues to be focused 
on math and writing. Our K
-
2 team continues to build on the guided reading professional development that we engaged 
in for y
ears with Scholastic. Students have access to classroom libraries that are well organized and have an abundance of 
appropriately leveled reading materials. We use guided reading groups, interactive read
-
alouds, and shared reading. 
 
 
Oakview fosters a colla
borative culture; members of the school community work together effectively to promote student's 
success. The many different voices, experiences, and styles of the school community add to its strength and vitality. 
Resources from donations and Parent Teach
er Club (PTC) are coordinated to enhance the school's program and the overall 
experience of each child. This is a truly special community!
 
 
MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The mission of Oakview Community School which was created collaboratively with staff, parents and
 
community is as

-
motivated, critical thinker and problem solver through 
challenging, student

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
School Facilities
 
Oakview Community School was modernized during 1996. A new heating and air
-
conditioning system was added during 
the summer of 2000. The modernization scope included roof/repair or replacement, 
interior, and exterior painting, 
window system replacement, energy
-
efficient lighting upgrade, new doors with handicapped accessible hardware, 
restroom restoration, electrical infrastructure upgrade to provide for internet, cable, telephone, fire, intrusio
n, and 
intercom system, throughout the school. Currently, there is sufficient space to house the student population. There is a 
site custodial staff that cleans the building, along with district support for major/minor repairs. The district provides 
garden
ing and landscape services on a regular schedule (every Thursday). Regular fire/emergency drills are held, and 
badges are required for all visitors and personnel. Field repair, driveway resurfacing, and irrigation system retrofit contin
ue 
to be a concern. 
One classroom wing and the multi
-
purpose room were modernized during the summer of 2003. All 
classrooms were carpeted during the fall of 2003. In 2005 East Valley Church donated time and materials to put in new 
concrete walkways, sod, shrubs and a new spri
nkler system.
 
 
The Board of Education and the Superintendent's policy is to ensure that all students are provided with a safe and well
-
maintained learning environment. The board approved resolutions in 1998 and 2002 to adequately fund maintenance 
activitie
s and preserve the repairs and improvements funded by two facility bond measures. The school buildings, 
classrooms and grounds are safe, clean and functional. An inspection of the facility was conducted in October 2019 and 
determined that there were no uns
afe conditions that required emergency repairs. District maintenance staff ensures 
that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
computer automated work order process is used to ensure ef
ficient service and that emergency repairs and health and 
safety repairs are given the highest priority. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards and custodial staffing 
requirements for all schools in the district. This school meets the Board'
s standards for custodial staffing and cleanliness. 
The school's custodians are trained in the proper use of cleaning chemicals and Integrated Pest Management techniques. 
They are managed day to day by the Principal with assistance from the district's main
tenance department. The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, with funding allocated for major repair or replacement 
of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditio
ning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.Annually the district budgets $2 million dollars for deferred 
maintenance activities.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades th
ree 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the mo

Professional development is a key part of the continuous improvement process for educators. The goal of our quality 
professional development is to support the learning of teachers and paraprofessionals to positively impact student 
achievement.  Annually, t
eachers and site administrators participate in professional development in a variety of 
opportunities.  Seventy
-
five minutes per week are dedicated to staff collaboration and training planned by site leadership 
teams. The District also provides a cycle of 
continuous professional development for Administrators through Principal 
Networks as well as Leadership Academies.
 
 
The District provides professional development opportunities for teachers and administrators that support the 
implementation of Common Core 
State Standards in English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and the 
ELA/ELD Framework.  Specific professional development initiatives include: Culturally Responsive Practices, Critical 
Literacy, TK
-
2 Reading, Supporting Independence and
 
Engagement through Reading and Writing, Math to the Core, 
Expository Reading and Writing Course, and ELD Foundations.  District departments, Center for Teacher Support, grant
-

ing opportunities.  Professional 
development opportunities are voluntary for teachers and are provided throughout the year in a variety of formats: during 
the school day, after school, on Saturdays, and during summer and vacation breaks. Many teachers and 
administrators 
also take advantage of opportunities with Sacramento County Office of Education, California Department of Education, 
the college/university programs, state/national education organizations, and private educational institutes.
 
 
What grounds t
he professional development in the district is the District Strategic Plan and the Local Control 
Accountability Plan. Professional Development is further determined using one or more of the following: (a) student 
achievement data, (b) staff survey data, an
d (c) district
-
identified goals.  Professional development addresses the Common 
Core State Standards, teaching strategies, curriculum, assessment, technology, classroom management, safety, and 
leadership. Administrator training accompanies professional dev
elopment in district focus areas, providing 
implementation support for teachers on site.  Content
-
area coaches are available at some schools.  Additional classroom 
support is provided to new and struggling teachers by consulting teachers from the Center fo
r Teacher Support.
