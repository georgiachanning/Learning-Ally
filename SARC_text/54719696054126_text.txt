By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Kings River Union Elementary School 
District prides itself on maintaining a clean, safe, and inviting campus. Buildings and 
grounds are well maintained, with painting done on a rotating schedule. Newly renovated classrooms and parking facilities 
have added to the overall appearance of the si
te. Kings River maintenance staff cares about the condition of facilities, 
taking time to perform regular maintenance and to repair in a timely fashion items in need of attention. Communication 
and surveillance equipment are employed for security and Voice

The facilities and grounds at Kings River Union Elementary School fully support quality teaching and student learning. 
Conditions in classrooms are conducive to student learning in that rooms are

maintained.
 
 
Regarding before
-
 
and after
-
school safety at Kings River, supervision by cl
assified and certificated staff is in place from the 
time students arrive until students are safely off campus. The campus is secured during the day from unauthorized access, 
with one open gate serving as the entry point to the school.
 
 
The school facility
 
was first built in 1951, and there have been multiple additions in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.  Our 
school facility has 29 regular classrooms, a library, a computer lab, a multipurpose room, and a special
-
education room.  
The design capacity of the schoo
l is for 700 students. Athletic facilities include baseball/softball diamonds, volleyball

The primary playground was completely redone during the summer of 2019 and provides an inclusive outdoor play area 
for our 4
-
7 year ol
d students to promote physical well
-
being and appropriate social interaction.
 
 
Kings River Union has improved the technology infrastructure for the entire campus to 1 Gigabyte of high speed wireless 
access for all students and staff. This has been accompli
shed by utilizing funding through E
-
Rate, developer fees, and the 
Local Control Accountability Plan supplemental and concentration funds.
