By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report
 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountabilit
y Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF o
r LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
p
rincipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school us
es 
the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance staf
f ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The school person
nel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
School Facility Good Repair Status (Most Recent Year)
 
Using the 
most recently collected
 
FIT data (or equivalent), provide the following:

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number 
of students who met the standard 
(i.e., achieved Level

-

PARENT INVOLVEMENT PROGRAMS:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC): The role of the SSC is to give parents, faculty and staff site decision making capacity. 
The SSC's role is to develop the school plan with budgets and monitor the implementation of that plan. Every 
Elementary school must have a S
chool Site Council composed of five parents or community members, the 
principal, three classroom teachers, and one other staff member (Education Code Section 52852).
 

 
English Learners Advisory Committee (ELAC) meets monthly with the Principal to discuss mat
ters of importance 
to the families of English language learner students and provides input on the school plan. Meetings are 
typically conducted in Spanish.
 

 
The Washington PTA meets monthly to discuss and plan programs for the students at Washington; dinner
 
is 
provided and childcare is available. The PTA sponsors Movie Nights, Cooking Classes, Music and Art classes as 
well as the end of year International Fair. Everyone is welcome to attend and participate.
 

 
Classroom Volunteers are always welcome to assist i
n classrooms and on study trips. Classroom volunteers must 
obtain a District Volunteer Badge to work with students.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of the School Site Safety Plan is to provide a unified template for school sites to respond and 
recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the disruption of normal school operations.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan guides a coordinated school staff response to an emergency, disaster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response acti
vities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over time and those that may occur without warning.

The objectives of the School Site Safety Plan are as follows:
 
1.
 
Protect the safety and welfare of students, school staff, and visitors.
 
2. Provide for a safe and coordinated response to emergencies.
 

 
4. Enable the District to restore normal conditions with minimal 
confusion in the shortest time possible.
 
5. Provide for the interface and coordination between sites and the District Emergency Operations Center (DEOC).
 
6. Provide for the interface and coordination between the District EOC and the Cities of Richmond, El 
Cerrito, San Pablo, 
Pinole, Hercules, and Contra Costa County Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
 
7. Provide for the orderly conversion of pre
-
designated District sites to mass care sites, when necessary.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is updated ann
ually.  Our school safety plan was last annually reviewed, updated, 
and discussed with school faculty and a student representative in January 2020.  A copy of the Comprehensive School
