By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg

.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The mission of El Camino Elementary School, a progressive community of educators and learners, is to empower every 
student with knowledge and skills to become a productive member of society through a dynamic educational 
environment.
 
At El Camino Elementary is a school in the Ontario
-
Montclair School District.  We are committed to working 
collaboratively with families, community members, teachers and staff to ensure that our El Camino students receive the 
skills needed to be college a
nd career ready. We currently serve a diverse population of approximately of 480 students 
from preschool to sixth grade.  This consist of 86.9% socioeconomically disadvantaged, 24.7% English Language Learners, 
26.3% students with disabilities, and 0.7 % fo
ster youth.  Additionally, El Camino is an integrated school that serves both 

 
 

roach, academically, behaviorally and socio
-
emotionally.   We participate in the school
-
wide implementation of Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS).  
PBIS focuses on creating and sustaining school
-
wide and  classroom behavior management syst
ems, as well as individual 
systems of support that improve the educational environment for all children.  Our aim is to explicitly teach behavior 
expectations and then reinforce the positive behaviors displayed by students through recognition. We implement
 
specific 
interventions to reshape behaviors and support individual students with their social/emotional/behavioral needs.  This 
includes silent mentoring, PBIS class, Check
-
in Checkout, and other restorative practices.  At El Camino, we also teach 
empathy
 
and acceptance for others through PBIS, in addition to our Peer Buddy program in which general education 
students serve as companions or partners to students with special needs within our Autism Program, working with them 
on social skills.  We are dedicat
ed to making sure that ALL students have the tools and resources they need to be successful.  
The dedication of our staff to teach our students how to serve as positive and contributing members of our society has 
been recognized by the county when our scho
ol was recently awarded a Civic Learning Award, as well as our school 
receiving PBIS gold recognition for the second year in a row.
 
 
C continues to be committed to providing 21st century learning.  We use technology as a tool for the classroom and 
througho
ut our campus, implementing one
-
to
-
one devices in Kindergarten through sixth grades.  We have a school library 
that is available for all students.  In order to encourage reading, we implement a Reading Counts incentive program.  
Different incentive program
s to encourage reading, as well as providing awards to students who meet their lexile level 

love of reading and increase the level of rea
ding among our students.
 
 
El Camino Elementary has implemented a Multi
-
Tiered System of Support to ensure that ALL students are successful in 
achieving state academic success.  Our primary grades (K
-
3) are implementing a systematic reading intervention pro
gram 
5 days per week, and our upper grades are implementing targeted instruction to students in homogenous group 5 days 
per week.  All grade levels are also implementing Math intervention 4 days a week, targeting specific math skills.  We then 
monitor our 

the data to drive instruction.  We provide our English Learners with explicit and targeted instruction to develop their 
English proficiency through
 
daily Designated ELD, as well as Integrated ELD.

At El Camino Elementary, our students learn that they ALL will and can earn a college degree.  We have adopted and 
implement the Advancement Via Individual Determination or AVID theory.  87% of our teacher
s are AVID trained; 
however, all of our teachers integrate AVID strategies into their daily practices and lessons. Our students continue to have 
multiple opportunities to enhance their learning by participating in Robotics classes, Coding classes, band, Ch
ess club, 
Young Authors, GATE classes, sports programs and other enrichment activities.  Students also have the opportunity to 
take different field trips to enhance their learning.  Student achievement and effective teaching go hand in hand and these 
are t
he most important things we do each day to ensure that ALL students are successful.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
El Camino Elementary School was constructed in 1955 with 24 permanent classrooms. Over the years, portable classrooms 
have been added to accommodate the growth of the student populat
ion. An additional portable was purchased by the 

workroom, resource support program room, speech room, and several small rooms used as of
fices and for student testing 

restrooms for both primary and upper grades, and adult restrooms in the office. All restrooms function proper
ly. During 
the 2006
-
07 school year, local bond funds, Measure M, and state matching funds were used to construct the multipurpose 
room. Drinking fountains and bathrooms w ere also modernized with those funds.
 
 
There is a primary grade playground, upper
-
gra
de playground, and a pre
-
school/kindergarten playground. Each 
playground is clean and adorned with shade trees, shrubs, and flowers. Additionally, there is a large field for soccer and 
softball. Adjacent to the school is Gibbs Park, which is available for 
all school groups. Proctors supervise children while at 
recess and lunch. Gates are locked and all visitors must register with the front office before entering the premises. Signs 
have been placed at all gates directing visitors to check in with office per
sonnel, at which time they sign in and wear a 
visitor's badge while on campus. Preschool students are escorted to their classroom where they must be signed in and 
out. Students w ho either arrive late or leave early or are picked up late after dismissal ar
e also signed out. At all times, 
the safety of children is the most important focus of the school so that all students and parents feel safe.

The district maintenance department maintains an active facilities inspection and repair system to ensure that al
l schools 
are clean, safe, and functional. District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good 
repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority in order that 
th
e educational process continues without interruption or problem.
 
 
The three custodians, as well as the entire El Camino staff, are keenly aware of the need to provide a clean, safe, and 
orderly campus for staff, students, and parents. The custodians are su
pervised on
-
site by the Elementary Administrator, 

reflect daily, weekly, monthly cleanings as well as deep
-
cleaning opportunities such as du
ring w inter, spring and summer 
breaks. Additionally, the site regularly submits and monitors work orders as needed to repair or replace any damaged or 
broken equipment.
 
 
The last state inspection mandated under the Williams Settlement was completed in Oct
ober 2019. The report on this 
inspection was forwarded to the Superintendent of Schools.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information 
relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the 
general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the 
CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed c
ourses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
