School Description
 
Vision of the San Carlos School District
 
The San Carlos School District shall provide an innovative and engaging learning experience that 
fosters the development of the Whole Child to ensure all 
students are well prepared for success in 
the 21st Century, as evidenced by:
 
1.
 
Reaching their highest academic, social, emotional, intellectual, and physical potential; 
and
 
2.
 
Becoming problem solvers, critical thinkers, risk
-
takers, designers, 
collaborators, and 
innovators; and
 
3.
 
Developing into contributing, empathic citizens and leaders who are responsible stewards 
of their world and care about equity and justice, both locally and worldwide
 
 
Principal's Message
 
Heather School is a community of l
earners and educators, including involved parents, who are 
committed to providing an innovative and engaging learning environment that fosters the 
development of the Whole Child and prepares our students to be successful, contributing citizens 
of the 21st 
Century. Through partnering with staff, parents and the community, we strive to 
promote an environment where children are encouraged to take risks as they experience diverse 
and challenging intellectual opportunities, academic as well as social and emotion
al. Heather 
students are nurtured both as individuals and as members of a community who collaborate 
together in their learning.
 
 
Heather has a beautiful campus. At its heart is the amphitheater where students, staff, and parents 
gather for whole school ass
emblies, student lunches, and family activities. We have an active and 
caring parent community who are true partners with the school in developing their children's 
education and endeavors. The school is supported by the leadership of a forward
-
thinking sch
ool 
board and a progressive district office. We have amazing support from the community through the 
efforts and commitment of the San Carlos Education Foundation (SCEF). SCEF keeps essential 
programs alive, programs that state budget cuts have eliminated f
rom districts all over the state. 
SCEF helps fund Heather's music program, literacy and technology associates, our librarian, school 
counselor, the P.E. program, study trips and more. Our teachers and staff are highly qualified, caring 
individuals. They ar
e dedicated to making certain that every child's needs are met, both 
academically and socially.  Currently, we are implementing the Common Core State Standards as 
well as the San Carlos School District Strategic Plan. These efforts include a focus on proje
ct
-
based 
learning and technology
-
infused education, personalizing learning and ensuring that all students 
acquire critical 21st Century Skills such as Communication, Collaboration, Critical Thinking and 
Problem Solving, Creativity and Civility. Education r
equires teamwork, and it is my sincere pleasure 
to be able to work with the Heather staff, parents, and students as we continue to learn together 
and promote the success of all of our students.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Ca
lifornia is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educationa
l agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, dat
a reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
One of Heather Elementary's special characteristics is its campus layout. The school is centered around a large amphitheater,
 
providing a location for 
outside lunch, morning assembly, and other school activities. It 
gives the campus an intimate feel and allows easy access to all areas of the school. Two 
large play yards, and the Heather Field provide recess, PE and outdoor activities for students.  Many of our classrooms enjoy
 
individual courtyards and 
class gardens. 
Heather Elementary was originally constructed in 1963 and is comprised of 21 classrooms, one multipurpose room, a library/med
ia center, 
including a literacy support/tech room, a staff workroom, an administrative building, including the staff lounge, and tw
o playgrounds. The Heather 
administration building was newly built in 2001, and the library/media center was fully modernized in 2005, along with the ki
ndergarten wing. The 
remaining classrooms were all remodeled in 2006

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority
 
4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate 
Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement st
andards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for 
entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Heather Elementary has a very active parent community. We are fortunate to be able to have parents participating in so many a
reas of our school. 
Parents are very interested in their child's education and are supportiv
e of the high quality program provided for students. Parents participate on many 
levels and in a variety of areas, including being in the classroom assisting the teacher or working with small groups of chil
dren, chaperoning on study 
trips, helping with fun
draising activities, assisting in the library, providing technology support, editing and publishing the Parent Teacher Associ
ation 
newsletter, volunteering in the book fairs, participating in family nights (which include Science Night, Math Night, STEM and
 
Engineering Night, and Story 
Night), serving as art docents, and participating in the Heather PTA. The PTA assists with a hot lunch program as a service t
o our school community, and 
holds two annual Book Fairs. The PTA provides many community
-
building eve
nts, such as the beginning of the year Family Fun Day, Multicultural Day, 
the Heather Hip Hop and Family Bowling Event. Parents also serve on our School Site Council working with staff on school impr
ovement goals. Many of 
our parents also represent our sch
ool in the larger San Carlos District community, serving on the PTA Coordinating Council, Healthy Cities Tutor program 
and the San Carlos Education Foundation.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priorit
y 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Heather Elementary School. The school is always in compliance with all l
aws
, rules, and regulations 
pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The School Site Safety plan is reviewed and updated annuall
y in the fall by the School 
Safety Committee. All revisions were communicated to both the classified and c
ertificated staff. The school's disaster preparedness plan includes steps 
for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills, as well as lockdown drills are conducted o
n a regular basis throughout the 
school year.  Students a
re supervised by staff before school, during lunch and after school. There is a designated area for student drop off and pick
 
up.

As part of the growth process, opportunities for training and staff development are provided at both the district and individ
ual school sites to 
administrators, teachers, and classified staff.  The district offers two full
-
day staff development days and ei
ght Wednesday afternoon sessions annually, 
where staff members are offered professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies. Comm
on Core Standards, 
Next Generation Science Standards, Project Based Learning, Readers Wo

are being integrated into the curriculum. Teachers also review student data, make timely decisions based in data, and share p
ractical tips and strategies 
with each other, during the
ir collaborative prep and meeting time. This year, we continued coaching and collaboration sessions for teachers during the 
school day. In addition to opportunities through the district, site "Flex Funds"  as well as other targeted budgets are used 
to prov
ide professional 
development to teachers to attend workshops, observe in other classrooms and to collaborate with colleagues. Areas of focus a
