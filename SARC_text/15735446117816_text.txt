By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School safety is a high priority for Rio Bravo Elementary.  In the case of emergency, all teachers' roles are 
clearly stated.  
If we need to evacuate our campus, we have an offsite location arranged.  All secretaries and additional office staff will 
retrieve all student information cards so that we may contact all parents and /or emergency contact listed on the 
in
formation card.
 
 
Also, included in the plan are all polices concerning fire and additional emergency contact numbers.
 
Our plan is reviewed and approved annually by our governing board and available in our office. Currently, we are reviewing 
our plan on a Di
strict level. A district safety team has been created to review the safety plans of both campuses of the 
RBGUSD with the intent of a comprehensive district
-
wide plan. Stakeholders from both campuses comprise the team. Our 
School Site Council has opted to d
elegate the development of our comprehensive safety plan to this safety team.

Rio Bravo Elementary has at least four early release days each year for staff 
development. Teachers and administrators 
attend these staff development days to improve the overall instructional program at our school.   In addition, teachers 
meet as a grade level for one hour a week in their Professional Learning Communities.  These me
etings allow ongoing 
collaboration between teachers and provide continuity among the grade level. Our staff has also participated in off
-
site 
trainings on a variety of topics such as AVID, Thinking Maps, Technology, English Language Development strategies,
 
Common Core State Standards, Lexia, Positive Behavior Instructional Supports, Illuminate assessment programs, and 
curriculum development in both Mathematics and English Language Arts. Additionally, each teacher has one day the 
district provides to them to
 
go off site or on campus to observe best practices.
