School Description
 
Principal's Message
 
 
We at Ramona Elementary are committed to our students' educational excellence. Our number 
one priority is Student Learning and Academic Growth. With a dedicated and 
knowledgeable staff, 
working in collaboration with our school families and community, our goal is to provide 
opportunities for Purposeful Learning each and every day. We work as a team to help our students 
gain the confidence and skills necessary to become
 
self
-
regulated learners; we know that when 
students are able to articulate where they are in their learning path and have a plan for where they 
need to be, the learning becomes a more personal and goal
-
oriented process. We are focusing this 
year on provid
ing multiple opportunities each and every day for students to engage in rigorous 
thinking and learning and academic conversation about that learning. Ramona Elementary is 1:1 
with Chromebooks in grades 1
-
6 and iPad carts in each TK/K classroom helping stud
ents become 
digitally literate citizens.
 
 
Our staff takes great pride in providing a high quality education to all of our students. We are 
committed to delivering quality instruction in all subject areas and to infusing the most effective 
teaching practice
s to elicit academic growth for our students.
 
 
Ramona Elementary has been educating children since 1896. The school site is located in the heart 
of Ramona, adjacent to the District Office and Montecito Alternative High School. There are 
approximately 430 s
tudents on campus, housed in 18 classrooms. Our staff also includes two 
Specialized Academic Instructors serving approximately 75 special education students. To meet the 
social and emotional needs of our students, a 50% counselor has been added to the staf
f; we 
maintain a partnership with community services such as Vista Hill and Smart Care which provide 
social/emotional instruction, small group sessions and parent interactions. Additional buildings 
include a library, a computer lab, and a multipurpose room
.
 
 
In addition to the TK
-
6 program, Ramona Elementary is also the home to the special education 
preschool program and the elementary intensive outpatient program, which provide services to 
students throughout the district. For students who need extra suppo
rt, we provide an after school 
program that offers homework assistance, and enrichment opportunities in computers, dance, 
science, crafts, gardening, reading support and athletics. In conjunction with Vista Hill/Smart Care 
we have been able to provide coun
seling for students and social groups to assist students with 
social growth and emotional growth.
 
 
The mission of Ramona Elementary School is for each student to grow and excel academically, 
physically, socially and emotionally. We utilize data
-
driven inst
ruction to ensure that our students 
have the knowledge, skills, confidence and values to become responsible, contributing citizens. We 
use ongoing assessments to measure student growth and guide instruction. We are committed to 
excellence using research
-
ba
sed strategies and work to utilize all available resources to meet the 
needs of our diverse community of learners.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publis
h a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a
 
Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent w
ith data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abou
t the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal 
or the 
district office.

Types of Services Funded
 
We believe all students can learn, and we recognize that all students learn and retain information in different ways. For stu
dents with differing learning 
styles or 
disabilities, RUSD has a wide variety of intervention programs. The District provides regular education, categorical programs
 
and additional 
educational opportunities designed to help all students meet or exceed grade
-
level standards and to prevent student
s from falling behind. Federal 
categorical and additional educational opportunities are funded through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which was
 
reauthorized in 2015 
as the Every Student Succeeds Act. These programs include, Title I (English La
nguage Arts and Mathematics support); Title II (Improving Teacher Quality); 
Title III (support for English Language Acquisition and improving Family Engagement); Title IV (support for elementary music 
and PE and secondary 
technology and vaping cessation). 
State funding provides supplemental dollars so the District can provide additional service to unduplicated count 
students, including foster youth, English language learners, homeless youth, and students of low income families. RUSD offers
 
a wide variety of
 
alternative 
education programs and settings, including the Ramona Community Campus which houses the Ramona Community Montessori School (T
K
-
6) and Mt. 
Valley Academy (TK
-
12 School/Independent Study); Future Bound (7
-
12 off campus Independent Study); and Mo
ntecito Continuation High School (9
-
12).
 
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that pr
ovides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length 
of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print 
documents.
