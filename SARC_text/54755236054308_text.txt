About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is the top priority at Westfield Elementary School. District approved yard supervisors, who 
have gone through 
fingerprinting and a stringent hiring process thr
ough Porterville Unified School District, under the direction of Administration, supervise students on 
campus before school, during recesses, during lunch, and after school. In coordination with Board Policy, all visitors must s

fice 
and receive proper authorization or have a Porterville Unified School District Volunteer Badge issued with clearance from Dep
artment of Justice through 
fingerprinting to be on campus. Visitors must display their office or district
-
issued pass at all t
imes. Parents wishing to apply for a Porterville Unified 
School District Volunteer Badge can get more information from the Westfield School Secretary or from Porterville Unified Scho
ol District Office. 
Additionally, a program called Raptor is expected to b
e utilized beginning in January 2020 wherein all visitors to the campus will need to have an official 
identification card issued either by the State of California or the federal government to be cleared before entering the camp
us.

lan is undergoing revision with a safety committee made up of parents, community members, law enforcement, teachers, 
students, and administration. The School Safety Plan is reviewed yearly, Fall 2019. Key elements of the plan focus on emergen
cy preparednes

kdown drills and earthquake drills are held quarterly. 
Porterville Unified School District will continue to meet regularly to update safety procedures within sites and district
-
