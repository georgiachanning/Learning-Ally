School Description
 
Hoover Pre
-
K, TK, and K
-
8 staff and students work hard to 
improve student achievement. Hoover School 
provides after school tutoring for students struggling in reading, writing and math. In the after school program 
students have a specific time to do their homework under supervision and guidance, a healthy snack i
s 
provided and physical fitness games are implemented to help students learn to be good team players and 
become physically fit. Through San Joaquin A+, Hoover is the beneficiary of UOP literacy tutors in all K
-
3 
classrooms for an average of eight hours a w
eek. Hoover teachers, parents and administrators continue to 
strive to find more ways to help students become proficient in all learning areas. The district implemented 
MAP (Measures of Academic Progress) assessments, which are given three times year. They
 
provide teachers 
and students an indication of student mastery of the standards that had been taught in the time period before 
the assessment. The results are immediate and teachers utilize these results to re
-
teach and improve the 
learning for all studen
ts. Goal setting through MAP is implemented. ST Math and Imagine Learning is also used 
with a minimum of 90 required minutes a week for grades 2
-
8 and 60 minutes a week in grades K
-
1. Students 
have the option to utilize other district adopted on
-
line softw
are that can also be accessed from the district's 
web page under Parent & Student Resources. This year teachers are working an extra 90 minutes every other 
week collaborating in Professional Learning  Communities (PLC's). Teachers also utilize one staff me
eting per 
month where they participate in a Shared Leadership Team. There are four main component areas in Hoover's 
Shared Leaderhip Team: Curriculum & Instruction, Resources & Technology, School Culture & Parent 
Involvement, and Mult
-
Tiered Systems of Sup
port. All of these components help to support Hoover School's 
Mission which states: The Hoover School community will create a rigorous, standards
-
based, challenging 
curriculum that provides all students with the academic tools and technological skills to b
ecome productive, 
critical thinking, cooperative citizens.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have
 
books in core classes for all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far mor
e meaningful when along with 
the more detailed description of textbooks conta

in our core classes and their dates of publication.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Ac
hievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter 
Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible stu
dents 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The pe
rcentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Note: ELA and mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative 

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter

ssment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

School Safety Plan
 
Hoover School places a strong emphasis on ensuring the safety of all students, staff 


ant emergency, the principal notifies 
appropriate site and distric
t personnel to resolve the emergency and safely secures or evacuates the students, based upon the site and district emergency
 
preparedness plans. A site review with the district Internal Evaluation Instrument (IEI) occurs annually. A comprehensive Sch
ool S
afety Plan, yearly 
reviewed by the School Site Council, is committed to providing a secure, peaceful and clean environment for Hoover School. Th

Preparedness Plan is reviewed and identifies procedures to follow during emergencies and nat
ural disasters. Emergency drills are conducted monthly 
and intense scenarios are created and practiced throughout the year with staff to ensure preparedness in the event of a real 
disaster. Staff also receive 
updated training for use of the Share911 emerge
ncy response system. Students are monitored thirty minutes before school, while on campus throughout 
the school day and after school. Yard supervisors, a campus security monitor, teachers, site administrators and school staff 
provide supervision of 
student
s before, during, and after school. The playground is safe for all students. The campus is fenced and locked during school ho
urs.  All visitors must 
sign in at the office and receive proper authorization to be on campus, and must display their passes at al
l times. A new safety entrance and departure 
gate has been installed for busses to drop off and pick up students with special needs. This system allows only those vehicle
s and departments with 
specialized badges to utilize the electronic entrance system.
