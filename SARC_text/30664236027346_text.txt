Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Most recent review date: 11/20/2019
 
 
Each year John Marshall School reviews and updates its comprehensive School Safety Plan and forwards a copy to the 
District's Risk Management
 
Office who then submits the School Safety Plan to the Board of Education for approval. Before 
adopting the compreh
ensive School Safety Plan, the School Site Council and the School Safety Plan Committee holds a 
public meeting at the school site for input about the school safety plan. Marshall School moved into a new building in 
January 2015. Ingress and egress maps, as
 
well as evacuation maps, have been updated for the new school and school 
site. The School Safety Plan covers four components: School Programs and Practices; Data Analysis, People and Programs 
and Physical Environment.
 
 
Marshall implements PBIS school
-
wide
. Students are encouraged to make positive choices and be respectful, responsible 
and safe at all times. Trimester awards assemblies recognize students for their academic growth, 
 
effort and attendance. 
Recognizing students emotional needs, Marshall provid
es counseling support through Western Youth Services and 
ERMHS. Support also provided through Phoenix House; in class social emotional lessons and small group counseling for 
those referred.
 
 
The school safety plan is a public document and is readily 
available for inspection at the school site and at the district 
office.
