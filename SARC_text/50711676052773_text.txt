School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most 
Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. 
The results of 
this survey are included within this report. The results of this survey are available at the district office and on the inter
net 
at mcs4kids.com.
 
 
James Marshall welcomes visitors on site; however, the MCS Visitors Policy is strictly enforce
d for the safety of all our 
students. Our campus is secure from 8:00 AM 
-
 
6:15 PM to include our After School Learning Program. James Marshall has 
an active Safety Committee which meets regularly.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the
 
school and the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School/Buildings:
 
This school has classrooms, a cafeteria, library, an early childhood ed program, and an administration offi
ce. The main 
campus was built in 1950 and opened in 1950.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair:
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is u
sed to ensure efficient service. Emergency repairs are given the 
highest priority. The school facility is in overall good repair.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule:
 
The Operations Department has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A su
mmary of these standards 
are available at the school office, or at the Maintenance & Operations office. The Maintenance & Operations Department 
works continuously with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., 
California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/
literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California St
ate University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The goal of James Marshall Elementary School is to provide a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and 
parents. The Safety Committee meet five times per year to discuss emergency situations. A fire drill occurs each month, 
and students and s
taff are aware of lockdown procedures. After school begins, gates are locked to minimize campus 
access. Visitors are to check with the office prior to coming onto school grounds. All students are expected to follow school
 
rules.  When rules are broken, dis
cipline is handled fairly by administrators, implementing Modesto City Schools Conduct 
Code.

Professional development in MCS is data driven using research
-
based best practices to ensure our students receive 
guaranteed and viable curriculum in every grade, in every school.    We use formative and summative data to drive our 
instructional decisions 
and focus for professional development.  To this end, we utilize multiple structures  to provide 
high
-
quality professional development to our staff including:  summer training, preservice
-
days, district wide professional 
development days, after school work
shops, Saturday workshops, substitute
-
release days, instructional coaching, a BTSA 
and PAR program,  and most recently a 0.5% compensation package for those who choose to complete an extra 6 hours 
of professional development.
 
 
MCS has prioritized our focus
 
on mathematics, literacy across grades and content areas, collaboration, welcoming 
schools/customer service, and building our capacity as professionals.  This has been in addition to the needed training in 
new adoptions, curriculum and standard updates an
d the like.  The professional development is sustained through site 
administration, district and site level instructional coaches, and intervention specialists.  In the 2019
-
202 academic year, 
a new division was also created in order to increase the qualit
y and quantity of professional development provided to 
classified, certificated, and managers alike.
