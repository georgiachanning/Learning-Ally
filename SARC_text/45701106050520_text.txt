School 
Description
 
2018/19 is John Moser's 22nd year in education. As a school leader, he believes that all students 
can be successful and that schools should maintain the same high standards that the best teachers 
do. The best teachers build relationships with t
heir students and use this knowledge to motivate 
them to learn, challenge them individually, and provide a culture of success. Staff members also 
need to feel they are growing within a professional learning community and can achieve at the 
highest levels.
 
 
Teachers and administrators take part in decision making at this school. Leadership is a goal for all 
employees. Teachers determine instructional methods as a team, and the entire staff develops staff 
training programs. Our School Site Council, which invo
lves parent members as well as teachers and 
administrators, and the Parent Club play key roles in shaping our students' educational experience.

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We choose our textbooks from lists that have already been a
pproved by state education officials.  We use a district
-
wide adoption process that includes 
teachers, parents, students and administrators.
 
 
We have also reported about our textbooks called for by the Williams legislation of 2004.  We report to the board 
in September and four times a year 
about the sufficiency of our textbooks as well as any complaints.  This online report shows whether we had a textbook for eac
h student in each core 
course during the 2017
-
18 school year and whether those textbooks covered
 
the California Content Standards.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Redding School District makes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. In 2016 the Distr
ict and the Board of Trustees 
authorized a Facilities Needs Assessment in order to 
identify our facilities' needs over the next decade. To support the assessment effort, in 2018 the 
community passed a $28 million facilities bond to repair, renovate, and modernize all District schools. Since the bond passed
 
in 2018 the District has used 
t
he Facilities Needs Assessment to plan out the Bond Initiatives.
 
 
In addition to the local bond, the District is seeking any State Modernization matching funds on a percentage basis, to assis
t with the expenditures for 
any major planned modernization work 
projects.
 
 
The District's Grounds and Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working
 
order are completed in a 
timely manner, while the Operations staff ensures that the schools are kept clean. A work orde
r process through a program called "Akita Box" is used to 
ensure efficient service; emergency repairs are given the highest priority. In addition to responding to emergency repairs, t
he maintenance department 

o catch up on routine repairs and enhancements.
 
 
Sequoia Middle School is located near the Sacramento River in central Redding. The school is situated in the center of the Ci
ty of Redding. Our original 
campus was built in 1949. In 1991, the community passe
d a bond that enabled us to build 21 new high
-
technology classrooms, a library, and a gymnasium. 
In 2003, we built the McLaughlin Auditorium, which we use for all of our visual and performing arts programs. Our campus is c
lean, and we constantly 
check the 
grounds to maintain high safety standards.  In 2014 perimeter security fencing was constructed around student areas.  In rece
nt years, a 
covered hallway, the cafeteria, band room, and kitchen were re
-
roofed.  In 2017, two high
-
use student restrooms were re
surfaced/remodeled. Most 
recently, in 2019, the McLaughlin Auditorium's roof was refurbished.
 
 
The school is staffed with two day, and two night custodian to provide a clean and hazard
-
free environment. The Principal, along with the maintenance 
staff, work
s with the custodians to develop cleaning schedules to ensure clean and safe schools. The custodial staff follows the Distric

standards, which are available at the District Office. In addition, on a monthly basis, the lead custodian uses a faci
lity survey instrument developed by 
the Northern California Schools Insurance to evaluate the conditions of the school's facility. These reports are sent to the 
District Facilities Department 
who then does an annual evaluation for the site.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil
 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Ba
lanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible stude
nts 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter

ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

are equipped with wireless communication tools throughout the day. Our safety plan 
includes campus supervisors, who monitor the campus before, 
during, and after school. The Redding School District has a partnership with the Redding Police Department (Resource Officer)
 
and we are proud to work 
closely with them to provide our students wit
h the safest campus!

, we evaluate teachers every 
three years.
