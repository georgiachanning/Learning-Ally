About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Arvin Union School District held a Public Hearing o
n September 10, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had sufficient and good 
quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of 
California. All students, 
includi
ng English Language Learners (ELL), are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks to instructional materials, or both, in core subjects 
for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a
 
cycle developed by the California 
Department of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available.
 
 
Arvin Union School District staff members are actively involved in the selection process of materials and textbooks. The sele
ct
ion process involves 
teachers, administrators, district support personnel, and parents. The district follows the State of California's Textbook Ad
option Cycle.  100% of students 
were provided textbooks as evidenced by the most recent August 2019 Williams R
eview.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Bear Mountain Elementary School 
consists of 55 classrooms, a library, a multipurpose room/cafeteria, a staff room, three playgrounds, and an 
administrative office. The facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample classroom and playground space.
 
 
The district governi
ng board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available upon reque
st from 
the district MOT office. The principal works closely with the Lead Maintenance person and custodial staff of three to devel
op cleaning schedules to ensure 
a clean and safe school.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a timely manner. An 
online work order process is used to ensure eff
icient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.   A complete repaint of the school 
and a new roof were completed during the summer of 2016 along with an electrical modernization project which was completed in
 
the cafeteria during 
the 2015
-
2016 school year. A Solar panel project was completed in March of 2017 and is fully operational. Remodeling of our office and
 
library occurred 
in 2017

education population and the Californi
a Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate ac
hievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
