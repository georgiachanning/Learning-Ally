Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
McKinley Primary School was built in 1937. The main building of McKinley Primary School contains eight classrooms, boys 
and girl
s restrooms, a staff restroom, a staff room, and various offices. In addition to this main building, there are seven 
relocatable classrooms which house students.  In the summer of 2016, McKinley Primary School removed 3 portable 
classrooms and added 3 stat
e of the art portables, including staff restrooms and a restroom attached to our Severely 
Handicapped classroom.  The entire playground blacktop was refurbished and new sod was installed in the grass area.
 
Our mission is to provide a safe, nurturing, child
 
centered environment that ensures a developmentally appropriate 
education for all children. We are committed to a partnership with parents that foster a curriculum, which prepares 
students to be responsible citizens in our changing world.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 

safe condition.  A cafeteria is 
available, but it is located on the Sycamore campus (necessitating the crossing of Vermont Street to have breakfast and 
lunch) and it requires a complex schedule to accommodate all McKinley and Sycamore students. The classro
oms in the 
McKinley building are below state square footage standards. The only classrooms on the McKinley site that have running 
water are the seven portables installed in 2001, 2005 and 2016.  In order to have student body assemblies and activities, 
stud
ents must meet outdoors or use the gym on the Sycamore campus when available. Adequate storage for the materials 
necessary to maintain a high quality primary education program is extremely limited. Playground equipment has been 
carefully selected to utiliz
e the small space for maximum participation. Playground equipment includes two playground 
structures, two primary basketball type games, a slide and games painted on the blacktop. The closure of Vermont Street 
during school hours has been a major asset imp
roving both the safety and orderliness of passage between campuses as 
noted.
 
This school was built in the 1930's and is the best maintained school with the best grounds inspected in the district. The 
upkeep of the facility and grounds is a testament to all
 
of the staff members at McKinley Primary School!

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.

McKinley Primary School has an updated emergency plan for fire drills, earthquake safety, and basic procedures: fire and 
earthquake 
drills are conducted throughout the school year. In addition , the Gridley Unified School District has adopted 
a district
-
wide crisis plan. All staff members are knowledgeable of the safety rules for the classroom and playground, and 
the procedures are dis
cussed regularly. There is an emphasis placed on bicycle, pedestrian, and train safety due to the 
school's proximity to a main thorough fare and railroad tracks.
