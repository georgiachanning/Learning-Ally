About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
School Inspections
 
Onaga Elementary works closely with the Maintenance & Operations Department (M&O) for larger projects, routine facilities mai
ntenance projects, and 
school inspections. The most recent facilities inspection at Onaga Elementary took place on June 26, 2019. S
chools are required by state law to report 
the condition of their facilities; the adjacent School Inspection table illustrated in this report identifies the state
-
required inspection areas and discloses 
the operational status in each of those areas. During
 
the 2018
-
19 school year, 100% of student restrooms were fully operational and available for student 
use at all times.
 
 
Facilities Maintenance
 

ounds are well
-
maintained and kept 
safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) employs an electronic work order sys
tem enabling school staff 
to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or speci
al projects. Teachers and staff submit requests for unscheduled maintenance 
and special projects to the senior custodian; the senior custodian then evaluates each request and either assigns the project
 
to site custodians or submits 
a work order to the prin
cipal for approval and submission to M&O.

vendors, depending upon the scope of the project. Emergen

A team of one day custodian and one full time evening custodian are assigned to Onaga 
Elementary and work closely with the principal for routine 
maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events. The principal and senior custodian communicate daily to discuss camp
us cleaning needs and 
safety concerns. Every morning before school begin
s, the daytime custodian inspects campus facilities for safety hazards, graffiti, and other conditions 
that require removal prior to students and staff entering school grounds. The day custodian is responsible for cafeteria setu
p/cleanup, school activity 
s
etups, minor maintenance, outside grounds areas cleaning, sweeping sidewalks, security checks, and keeping restrooms clean an
d stocked. Restrooms 
are monitored and checked by the custodian throughout the day as a proactive measure in eliminating vandalism 
and keeping facilities safe, sanitary, 
and stocked. The evening custodian is responsible for general cleaning of classrooms (including sanitizing desktops), restroo
ms, kitchen, and library. 
When students are on winter and summer break, custodians perform a
 
thorough, detailed cleaning throughout the campus.
 
 
Custodians follow a rigid set of cleaning standards approved by the Morongo Unified School District. Each custodian receives

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority:

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of
