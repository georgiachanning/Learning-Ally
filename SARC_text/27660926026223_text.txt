About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For 
additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Monterey Peninsula Unified School District held a public hearing on August 201
9, and determined that the school had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, incl
uding English learners, are given 
their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks 
and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making the 
textbo
oks used in the 
school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation 
is made to the School 
Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended mater
ials are available for parent examination at the district 
office prior to adoption. The table displays information collected in August 2018 about the quality, currency, and availabili
ty of the California Common 
Core standards

aligned textbooks and other in

School Facility Conditions and Plann
ed Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
In 2010, the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District overwhelmingly approved Measure P, a $110 million locally
-
controlled school bond measure to 
fund the first phase of critical repairs and improvement to our local sch
ools. The district's newest school was built in 1965, more than 50 years ago, and 
our Facilities Needs Assessment has identified over $680 million in critical repairs to all MPUSD schools. Recently, in 2018,
 
voters approved Measure I, a 
$213 million school
 
facilities bond by 70%.
 
 
Many school bond projects are underway. Visit www.mpusd.net and search for Measure I & P Dollars at Work for additional detai
ls.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online 
supplement to this report called for by the Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical sys
tems, heating and ventilation 
systems, and more. The impo
rtant purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for
 
this 
assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the si

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible
 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

School Safety Plan
 
The safety and well being of students and staff are high priorities for the Monterey Peninsula Unifie
d School District and this school. Under Senate Bill 
187, every school in the district is required to complete (or review and update) a School Safety Plan by March 1 of each year
. The plan is reviewed and 
evaluated by the School Safety Planning Committee, 
the School Site Council, and the school principal before being presented to the Board of Education 
for final review and adoption. The approved plans are posted on each school's website, as well as the district website at www
.mpusd.net.
 
 
Highlights of this 
school's plan are detailed below:
 
The school staff works together to ensure the safety of all students. There is a Safety Committee that reviews the safety pla
n annually and presents it to 
the School Site Council for review and approval. Teachers and suppo
rt staff have assigned times to supervise the school grounds before and after school. 
Visitors sign in and out at the office and wear badges so that staff knows who is approved to be on campus. PBIS aligned scho
ol rules are posted in each 
classroom. There 
is a PBIS Matrix aligned to these rules. Highland Elementary School has established positive relationships with the Seaside P
olice 
Department and they are quick to respond with assistance when necessary. Monthly students and staff do practice drills for ea
rthquakes (quarterly), 
ALICE (twice  year) or fire drills (monthly) to prepare for emergency situations. The MPUSD has trained administrators in ALI
CE protocols in order to 
insure additional safety for more students and staff at school. ALICE is an acronym
 
for Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, and Evacuate. The main objective 


emergency. The comprehensive School 
Safety Plan has been reviewed by the Safety Committee and approved by the School Site Council in December 6, 
2019.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The Monterey Peninsula Unified School District has extensive opportunities for teachers to improve instruction, engagement an
d intervention. The 
priorities were determined by analysis of student data, teacher input and professional research. District professional develo
pment is provided by 
teachers, administrators, and professional trainers. The trainings are provided in workshops, staff meetings, 
PLCs (Professional Learning Communities), 
online and at conferences. Highland Elementary School has the flexibility to develop its own PD plan at the site level. Teach
ers have multiple opportunities 
to improve instruction and subject area knowledge. Teache
rs are supported by administrators at the district and site level, as well as by an Academic 
Coach. There are regular classroom visits to provide feedback and provide support. Highland's priorities are: MTSS; Balanced 
Literacy; and Small Group 
Instruction 
in ELA and Math.
 
 
Highland Elementary School has developed a unique system of coaching and professional development to support Writer's Worksho
p and other core 
content areas. Our Academic Coach provides an hour per grade level of professional development t
o support Writer's Workshop while students are 
provided choral music and PE instruction. This system of support allow teachers time in the school day to learn and plan for 
the week's writing instruction.
