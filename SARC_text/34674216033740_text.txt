School Description
 
Robla School is part of the Robla School District, which consists of five 
elementary schools and one 
preschool program, serving over 2,000 students. The district is located within the City of 
Sacramento, northeast of the central city. The Robla School District was originally established as 
the Oak Grove School District in the ea
rly 1890s. The district's name was changed to Robla School 
District in 1916. Robla is a derivative of the Spanish word "roble" which means "cluster of British 
Oak trees." During the past school year, Robla School served nearly 500 students in transitional 
kindergarten through sixth grade on a traditional schedule.
 
 


programs, academic achievement, resources, students, and staff.
 
 
We believe that belonging to a safe, caring learning community is central to fulfilling our mission to 
help children become knowledgeable, responsible and caring citizens. All students are im
portant, 
accepted and respected. Our school motto is The Robla School Rises which means that in times of 
difficulty, we work hard, persevere and always give our best. The students are to also behave The 

 
Respect, Responsibility, Really Safe and 
Ready to Learn.
 
 
We are fortunate to have dedicated and knowledgeable teachers, assistants, and support staff, 
eager to make a difference for our students. They have high expectations and an unshakable belief 
that 
all children deserve a rich elementary education. We are committed and take a professional 
approach to teaching a common core curriculum, providing lessons, assessments and report cards 
based on State Common Core Standards and educational research. When st
udents have difficulty, 
we go to work to provide a plan for intervention and additional support.
 
 
Parents are our partners in discovering the special skills and talents of our students and guiding 
their learning to high standards. A special emphasis is pla
ced on making all school contacts friendly 
and welcoming to the diverse families being served. We also have a PTC
-
Parent Teacher Club that 
supports the many school functions we have throughout the school year. They are an integral 
partner which helps the e
veryday functioning and achievement of our school.
 
 
Our students thrive in the friendly, small school environment. Younger students have older class 
buddies and join in a variety of field trips, art, tech, drama, and creative activities. Also, students 
exp
lore environmental studies on our nearby bike trail. Opportunities to participate in leadership 
and community service throughout the year are coordinated by our Student Council.
 
 
District Vision Statement: Every student reaches their potential in a growth
-
minded environment 
rich in challenging practices and reflective learning for all.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Robla Elementary School District held a public hearing on August 29, 2019, and determined that each school within the distric
t had sufficient and good 
quality textbooks, instructional materials, or
 
science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, 
including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in
 
the 
classroom and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the Californi
a Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by t
he State are reviewed by all teachers and 
a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommende
d materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption
. The table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Robla School was originally constructed in 189
6 and has since undergone complete modernization. Major additions to the site were constructed in the 

lder classrooms were updated 
with new cabinetry and whiteboards. Carpets are replaced in all classrooms on a rotating basis. During the 2004
-
05 school year, six new classrooms were 
constructed to aid in class size reduction. During the summer of 2009, Robla School had the front loadin
g/drop off zone reconstructed to relieve 
congestion which in turn made it safer for Robla families. The front zone also had an upgrade in the landscaping which made i
f a more beautiful and 
welcoming entrance. Also in the summer of 2009, Robla School had th
e two intermediate bathrooms completely modernized with new urinals, toilets, 
and sinks. The campus is currently comprised of 22 classrooms (including portables), a library, one computer lab, one staff r
oom, a cafeteria/multipurpose 
room, a kitchen, two pl
aygrounds, the main office, and three administrative offices.
 
 
Major construction projects are scheduled to take place at Robla School during the 2020
-
2021 school year. A new two
-
story building will house 
classrooms, the school office, and the school libra
ry. Portable classrooms will be demolished. All classrooms in permanent wings at the school will be 
modernized and brought up to the "21 Century Classroom" standard.
 
 
Cleaning Process: Robla School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff,
 
and volunteers. The district governing board has adopted 
cleaning standards for all schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the s
chool year with an emphasis 
on classrooms and restrooms. A joint effort b
etween students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-
free. The Principal works daily with the 
custodial staff of three to develop cleaning schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair: A schedu

functions occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered by Robla Elementar
y School Distr
ict to 
ensure that school grounds and facilities remain in excellent repair. A work order process is used when issues arise that req
uire immediate attention. 
Emergency repairs are given the highest priority; repair requests are completed efficiently and in
 
the order in which they are received.

nurturing and orderly school campus that encourages positive attitudes in students and staff. Schoolwide 
PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports) was implemented in 2014. The schoolwide system is a proactive way of teach
ing proper behaviors to 
ou
r students. There are also many interventions and strategies used to enhance a more positive interaction with students when t
hey don't make 
appropriate choices. Data is regularly collected and analyzed to make informed team decisions about school safety an
d climate.
 
 
The School Site Safety is reviewed annually and shared with all school community members Key elements of the plan focus on di
saster and emergency 
preparedness, staff communication, and security on campus. Emergency drills are held on a regular 
basis: fire drills are held once a month, earthquake 
drills are held once a year and three lockdown drills are scheduled annually.

In the Robla School District, we believe in life
-
long learning, and all staff members in the district are given opportunities to continue their learning.  It 
does not matter how long you have been 
working as a teacher, an administrator, as a bus driver or as a custodian, there are still new skills to be learned.  
This is the concept behind professional learning days that take place throughout each school year in the Robla School Distric
t.
 
 
Each year
, the school schedule includes professional learning days for all staff.  The first professional learning day is scheduled on
 
the day before the first 
day of school.  The second day is scheduled at the end of the first trimester of the school year.  The th
ird day is scheduled at the end of the second 
trimester of the school year.  Students in the district do not attend school on these days in order to allow all staff to par
ticipate in learning activities.
 
 
For classified staff, the focus of these learning d
ays is based upon the learning needs of each department in the school district.  Learning for custodians 
may focus on the correct use of new equipment that has been purchased for use by the custodian in their cleaning duties.  Lea
rning for kitchen staff ma
y 
focus on the use of new equipment or on healthy meal planning or scratch cooking techniques.  Secretaries may focus their lea
rning on new office 
software or on social
-
emotional learning practices for use with students who come to the office.  Each depart
ment lead will consider the needs of the 
staff, seek input from staff members or may be directed to focus on a specific learning need.  For example, all staff members
 
at all levels are being training 
in appropriate response techniques in an active shooter 
situation.  A district team was trained in specific techniques by a consulting firm.  The training 
team then conducts training for different department staff members on different days during the school year, until all staff 
members have been trained.
 
 
For 
certificated staff, teachers, administrators, and specialists, professional learning has focused since the start of the 2017
-
2018 on specific high impact 
instructional practices.  The Robla School District, in partnership with the Resourcing Excellence in 
Education (REEd)  Center at the University of California 
at Davis, has defined specific guidelines around effective teaching.  These research
-
based practices focus on specific teacher behaviors and specific 
student behaviors which increase active learning,
 
language production, and higher
-
level thinking in the classroom. Another area of focus is 
Social/Emotional Learning which provides specific strategies for ensuring schools are calm and students feel safe physically 
and emotionally.
 
 
Professional Learning 
Support Teachers (PLSTs)then provide on
-
going support for staff as they take these practices back to their classrooms for 
implementation.  The PLSTs are classroom teachers who work in pairs.  Each pair, one at first grade, one at fourth grade and 
one at si
xth grade, offer 
support in a variety of ways.  They might come to a classroom and model a specific teaching practice.  They might serve as a 
substitute in a classroom to 
allow the teacher to leave and observe another teacher at his/her grade level who has
 
shown exemplary skill with a certain teaching technique.  They 
might team teach a lesson with a teacher and offer coaching in real
-
time as the lesson is taking place.  PLSTs are available to teachers at all grade levels 
and all levels of experience.  A te
acher may contact them directly for support with all practices that are the focus of our professional learning.
 
 
PLSTs and Principals receive on
-
going training in coaching techniques to ensure that they are gaining skill in effective practices for supporti
ng teachers.  
Special coaching training sessions take place throughout the school year.  Specific techniques are discussed and coaches are 
then encouraged to put 
them into practice.  Follow
-
up training sessions allow coaches to share their experiences and 
refine their skills.

Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) are also at the core of professional learning for all certificated staff.  PLC train
ing was provided to all teachers 
and administrators during the 2017
-
2018 school year.  Our system has been de
signed to allow teachers to meet in PLC teams throughout the school year.  
Classroom teachers meet in grade
-
level teams at their school on a weekly basis when their students are in enrichment activities with enrichment teachers.  
In addition, District
-
wide
 
PLC meetings are held once a trimester where all teachers at a grade level are able to meet together as a PLC focused on the 
needs of that specific grade level.  Principals and PLSTs also support this work as they provide coaching to PLC teams as nee
ded o
r as requested.
 
 
Additional Professional Learning activities are offered to all staff after the end of the school day.  The focus of these tra
inings is based on the needs of 
staff.  Recent focus areas for teachers include technology in the classroom, socia
l
-
emotional learning, and foundation skills in English Language Arts.  All 
staff members at all levels are also invited to Resilience training, which takes place throughout the school year after schoo
l.  Resilience focuses on the 
relationships we have with
 
the members of the community we serve with a special emphasis on cultural sensitivity.  This work is done in consultation 
with the Roberts Family Development Center and our Resilience consultant, Dr. Sara Truebridge.
