School Description
 
Glenmeade Elementary School is located in
 
Chino Hills in an established residential area. The school 
site was developed on approximately 9.2 acres of land overlooking the Chino Valley. The land was 
purchased in 1966 and the first buildings were completed in 1967. School opened for the first time 
for Glenmeade students in January 1968. Additional classrooms and a multipurpose room were 
added to double the student capacity in 1973. In 2012, Glenmeade went through a modernization 
project that includes updating classrooms and repairing the slopes. Gle
nmeade is included in future 


bird with a school pennant with our scho

wearing the school logo and the school colors of yellow and royal blue.
 
 
The mission of Glenmeade Elementary School Staff is to work as partners with students, parents 
and the community to provide a
 
rigorous and academically challenging educational setting, safe 
and secure environment, and overall positive school climate to benefit all students. Our goal is to 
inspire students to do their best in the present, and prepare for their dreams for the futu
re, 


stand for Responsibility, Achievement, Character and Empath
y. These characteristics also support 
our Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS)across all grades. Positive behavior 
expectations are in all classrooms and all common areas. We have a school wide reward system to 
recognize our student's great b

 
 
Our teachers are committed to the belief that all children can succeed and learn, and they work to 
motivate students to reach their highest potential. It is our highest goal that every child is 
challenged and successful.

About the SARC
 
By February 
1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding F
ormula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and l
ocal priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

e extent to which textbooks 
and instructional materials have been p
rovided to students. The Board of Education adopted Resolution 2019/2020
-
18 which certifies as required by 
Education Code 60119 that (1) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials have been provided to each student, including 
English learners, that a
re 
aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with the cycles and context of the curriculum frameworks in the foll
owing subjects: 
history/social science, mathematics, reading/language arts, and science, (2) sufficient textbooks or instruction
al materials were provided to each pupil 
enrolled in foreign language and/or health classes, (3) laboratory equipment was available for science laboratory classes off
ered in grades 9
-
12, inclusive.
 
 
Textbooks and instructional materials are provided for ea
ch student for use in class and to take home. It was determined that each pupil in each school 
has sufficient textbooks and instructional materials that are aligned to the academic content standards in the core subject a
reas for the 2019/2020 school 
year. 
Additionally, sufficient textbooks and/or instructional materials were provided to each pupil for visual and performing arts.
*Please note: In 
reference to materials not from a most recent State Board Adoption (SBE): In November 2017, the California State B
oard of Education approved a list of 
History/Social Science programs for districts to consider for their new adoption. CVUSD elected to continue to use current Di
strict adopted materials 
while further studying program options provided on the SBE list to co
nsider for a future piloting process. CVUSD reviewed current District adopted 
materials and determined that they meet current history/social science standards.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Chino Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) makes it a priority to maintain safe, clean, and effective school sites for our 
students, staff, and parents. The 
safety of students is of paramount importance to CVUSD. In the morning, staff supervision is provided to watch the cafeteria,
 
entrance gates, and 
playground activities. During lunch and recess times, noon ground supervisor
s and teachers monitor students to ensure students interact safely. At the 
end of the school day, staff supervises student dismissal. The staff and student workspaces for this site are cleaned on a re
gular basis by the school site 
custodial staff. In addit
ion to regular cleanings, deep cleanings are scheduled and carried out during breaks and vacation periods. The school facilit
y is 
adequate and has sufficient classrooms, playgrounds, and staff spaces in order to operate efficiently. A recently completed s
c
hool improvement for this 
site was the schoolwide security camera and keyless access system planned for the 2020/2021 school year.

To ensure sites are clean, safe and functional, Maintenance and Operations department staff conduct inspections at the schoo
l sites on a continual basis. 
School sites may also enter maintenance requests by accessing the School Dude system. After the school site request is entere
d into the system, a work 
order is generated, and the Maintenance staff works diligently to complete 
all work orders in a timely manner.  The Maintenance team utilized the Facility 
Inspection Tool (FIT), a survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction (OPSC), 
to record inspection results.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co

-
in log is located in the school office and all visitors mus
t sign in before 
going onto the campus. In addition, all visitors must wear an identifying badge while on campus. To increase security, all ga

The Chino Valle
y Unified School District is committed to providing an environment that fosters health and safety, in both form and function.
 
This 
commitment extends to the process of developing and maintaining a comprehensive Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan as a
 

Safe Schools Plan and is evident from the individual site to the overall District. These plans delineate actions to protect a
ll students while they are at 
school. The plans are designed with the help of security staff members, local
 
law enforcement, local fire, and emergency management, and public health 
officials as required by Education Code 32280
-
32282.
 
 
Plans are reviewed and updated yearly in accordance with Education Code 32286. These plans include procedures to respond to c
rit
ical incidents, such 
as fire, earthquake, or intruders. School personnel practice these drills regularly.
 
 
The primary purpose of the Chino Valley Unified School District Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan is to define roles a
nd responsibilities at the 
site and between the site and district office management. The Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan e
stablishes the minimum requirements for 
school and site plans throughout the District. This Plan meets the requirements of the Standardized Emergency Management Syst
em (SEMS) as mandated 
by California Code of Regulations, Sections 2400
-
2450, and the Nation
al Incident Management System (NIMS) as mandated by Government Code 8607. 
It also meets the requirements for earthquake preparedness found in Title 5 (California State Education Code, Sections 35295
-
35297).
