Description
 
At
 
San
 
Elijo
 
Elementary
 
School
 
we
 
encourage
 
students
 
to
 
achieve
 
their
 
personal
 
best
 
through
 
taking
 
academic
 
risks
 
and
 
demonstrating
 
responsibility
 
for
 
themselves.
 
Our
 
supportive
 
community
 
sets
 
high
 
expectations
 
for
 
life-long
 
achievement
 
through
 
active
 
involvement
 
in
 
their
 
student's
 
education.
 
Our
 
school
 
is
 
committed
 
to
 
the
 
belief
 
that
 
all
 
students
 
can
 
and
 
will
 
learn.
 
We
 
feel
 
that
 
creating
 
cohesive
 
and
 
effective
 
professional
 
learning
 
teams
 
is
 
the
 
best
 
practice
 
in
 
achieving
 
our
 
goals
 
for
 
students.
 
Our
 
priorities
 
focus
 
on
 
teaching
 
common
 
core
 
state
 
standards
 
through
 
the
 
instructional
 
framework
 
of
 
the
 
Essential
 
Elements
 
of
 
Instruction,
 
and
 
making
 
informed
 
decisions
 
for
 
those
 
students
 
still
 
needing
 
differentiated
 
instructional
 
support.
 
Additionally,
 
we
 
take
 
great
 
pride
 
in
 
supporting
 
the
 
social
 
and
 
emotional
 
needs
 
for
 
all
 
our
 
students.
 
Our
 
school
 
motto
 
"SEE
 
Us
 
S.O.A.R."
 
reminds
 
students,
 
staff,
 
and
 
parents
 
to
 
Seize
 
Opportunities
 
and
 
Achieve
 
Results.
 
 
This
 
year
 
we
 
continue
 
our
 
focus
 
on
 
shared
 
leadership
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
shared
 
ownership
 
of
 
all
 
students.
 
We
 
believe
 
that
 
when
 
we
 
SOAR
 
together
 
we
 
all
 
achieve
 
more,
 
so
 
collaboration
 
around
 
results
 
is
 
our
 
school
 
culture.
 
Our
 
grade
 
level
 
leadership
 
works
 
collaboratively
 
with
 
site
 
administration
 
to
 
support
 
a
 
structure
 
for
 
regular
 
weekly
 
collaboration.
  
San
 
Elijo
 
Elementary
 
School
 
is
 
home
 
to
 
a
 
diversity
 
of
 
learners
 
who
 
are
 
supported
 
in
 
our
 
general
 
education
 
classrooms,
 
Excel
 
classrooms
 
and
 
Learning
 
Center
 
classrooms.
 
All
 
of
 
our
 
students
 
have
 
a
 
voice
 
and
 
choice
 
in
 
their
 
learning
 
which
 
is
 
enhanced
 
through
 
working
 
collaboratively
 
with
 
students
 
who
 
have
 
different
 
strengths.
 
 
Our
 
character
 
education
 
program,
 
ﬁLiving
 
the
 
Eagle
 
Wayﬂ
 
incorporates
 
character
 
traits
 
with
 
an
 
emphasis
 
on
 
kindness
 
and
 
empathy
 
into
 
our
 
daily
 
lives
 
at
 
SEES.
 
Teachers
 
deliver
 
monthly
 
lessons
 
on
 
the
 
traits
 
along
 
with
 
showing
 
weekly
 
videos
 
produced
 
by
 
students
 
supporting
 
our
 
school
 
culture
 
and
 
character
 
traits.
 
Students
 
are
 
reinforced
 
campuswide
 
for
 
displaying
 
these
 
character
 
traits.
 
Students
 
of
 
the
 
month
 
are
 
selected
 
by
 
classroom
 
teachers
 
based
 
upon
 
these
 
character
 
traits.
 
The
 
character
 
traits,
 
with
 
the
 
focus
 
on
 
empathy,
 
has
 
emerged
 
from
 
our
 
desire
 
to
 
create
 
an
 
anti-bullying
 
environment
 
for
 
all
 
students.
 
Students
 
at
 
SEES
 
learn
 
that
 
words
 
can
 
be
 
hurtful,
 
so
 
they
 
should
 
be
 
mindful
 
of
 
their
 
language
 
frequently.
 
Students
 
are
 
taught
 
that
 
unkind
 
words
 
and
 
bullying
 
are
 
not
 
tolerated.
 
The
 
use
 
of
 
restorative
 
practices
 
and
 
building
 
relationships
 
with
 
other
 
students
 
is
 
a
 
key
 
part
 
to
 
this
 
culture.
 
 
About
 
the
 
SARC
 
By
 
February
 
1
 
of
 
each
 
year,
 
every
 
school
 
in
 
California
 
is
 
required
 
by
 
state
 
law
 
to
 
publish
 
a
 
School
 
Accountability
 
Report
 
Card
 
(SARC).
 
The
 
SARC
 
contains
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
condition
 
and
 
performance
 
of
 
each
 
California
 
public
 
school.
 
Under
 
the
 
Local
 
Control
 
Funding
 
Formula
 
(LCFF)
 
all
 
local
 
educational
 
agencies
 
(LEAs)
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
prepare
 
a
 
Local
 
Control
 
and
 
Accountability
 
Plan
 
(LCAP),
 
which
 
describes
 
how
 
they
 
intend
 
to
 
meet
 
annual
 
school-specific
 
goals
 
for
 
all
 
pupils,
 
with
 
specific
 
activities
 
to
 
address
 
state
 
and
 
local
 
priorities.
 
Additionally,
 
data
 
reported
 
in
 
an
 
LCAP
 
is
 
to
 
be
 
consistent
 
with
 
data
 
reported
 
in
 
the
 
SARC.

Parental
 
involvement
 
is
 
a
 
cornerstone
 
of
 
our
 
school's
 
success.
  
Our
 
Parent
 
Teacher
 
Organization
 
is
 
incredibly
 
dedicated
 
to
 
supporting
 
our
 
teachers
 
and
 
students
 
so
 
that
 
we
 
all
 
have
 
the
 
resources
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
create
 
successful
 
learning
 
conditions.
  
Our
 
PTO
 
works
 
tirelessly
 
to
 
raise
 
money
 
for
 
our
 
students
 
through
 
fundraisers
 
such
 
as:
 
Cash
 
for

Apex
 
Fun
 
Run,
 
Country
 
Fair,
 
Monster
 
Bash
 
and
 
Hops
 
in
 
the

Their
 
efforts
 
go
 
towards
 
funding
 
our
 
extracurricular
 
and
 
academic
 
classes
 
for
 
students
 
including:
 
science,
 
drama,

is
 
available
 
for

by
 
the

at

Our
 
teachers
 
hold
 
bi-monthly
 
PLC
 
meetings
 
to
 
discuss
 
student
 
learning
 
outcomes
 
focused
 
on
 
4
 
questions:
 
What
 
do
 
we
 
expect
 
our

How
 
will
 
we

learning,
  
How
 
will
 
we
 
respond
 
when
 
students
 
are
 
not
 
meeting
 
the
 
standards
 
(intervention),
 
How
 
will
 
we
 
respond
 
when

already
 
know
 
it
 
(acceleration).
 
Our
 
staff
 
has
 
been
 
trained
 
in
 
restorative
 
practices.
  
A
 
restorative
 
school
 
is
 
one
 
which
 
takes
 
a
 
restorative
 
approach
 
to
 
resolving
 
conflict
 
and
 
preventing
 
harm.
  
Restorative
 
practices
 
enable
 
those
 
who
 
have
 
been
 
harmed
 
to
 
convey
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
the
 
harm
 
to
 
those
 
responsible,
 
and
 
for
 
those
 
responsible
 
to
 
acknowledge
 
this
 
impact
 
and
 
take
 
steps
 
to
 
put
 
it
 
right.
