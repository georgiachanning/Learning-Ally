By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

For the 2019
-
2020 year, 48% of the days noted are partial days and 52% are full days.  All training and curriculum 
development activities at Hill Creek School support the implementation of Common Core 
Content Standards and State 
curricular frameworks. Teachers annually receive a minimum of 26 partial days of professional development at the site. 
These are designed as whole staff training, grade level cohort meetings, or personalized instructional data s
tudy.  An 
additional full day is offered as part of our district curriculum alignment.  Decisions concerning selection of staff 
development activities on these partial days are performed by the principal, district administrators, and grade level 
representa
tives using tools such as teacher input, district benchmark results, data analysis, and focus groups to determine 
the areas in which additional teacher training may enhance classroom instruction and increase student achievement 
levels. Content and focus ar
eas are established in which specific grade level teachers participate.  In addition to these 27 
site and district
-
defined days, specialized instruction such as middle school CGI math curriculum, or primary guided 
reading training is provided to the teache
rs assigned to those specific areas to ensure alignment of rigorous instruction.  
Teachers may also identify areas of interest to improve teaching and learning.  Interest
-
based professional development 
include Social Emotional Learning techniques, English 
Language Learner literacy development techniques, and 
mathematical processing techniques where teachers opt to participate in coordination with district staff, County Office of 
Education trainers, or curriculum specialists.  During the 2019
-
2020 school yea
r, specific focus is being made in curriculum 
alignment across grade levels.  A total of 14 bi
-
weekly partial
-
day releases are provided for teachers to make standard
-
aligned courses of study at all grade levels, in literacy and in middle school content are
as.  This accounts for the specific 
increase in professional learning investment this year.  Hill Creek School offers support to new and veteran teachers 
through peer coaching and mentoring.   All teachers also have access to a group of teachers on special
 
assignment that 
work as Curriculum Resource Teachers.  Using these resources, certificated staff can tailor professional learning to their 
immediate needs and receive small group and even one
-
on
-
one support. Also, certificated staff may complete a 
persona
lized learning plan each year and receive compensation for professional learning outside contracted hours.  
Classified support staff receive job related training from department supervisors and district representatives.
