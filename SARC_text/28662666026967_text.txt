By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Description: Vichy Elementary has been a community
-
centered schoo
l since its inception in 1953.  We are located on the 
east side of Napa, 5 miles from downtown, in a semi
-
rural, suburban setting. We have been recognized as a California 

-
5 school community is committed
 
to providing an inspiring and 
productive learning environment.  Vichy serves 356 students. We are committed to strong character and high academic 
achievement.  We value character over achievement because we believe it requires the former to achieve the la
tter. We 
support students to build a strong foundation in language arts and mathematics by challenging all students to improve 
daily in their ability.   Our school embraces the integration of the arts and technology across the curriculum to foster 
inquiry,
 
creativity, critical thinking, and communication skills to prepare students for the 21st Century.  In 2010, Vichy 
students achieved the highest Academic Performance Indicator (API) in both our District and County with an API score of 
937!  This performanc
e places our school among the top schools in the state.
 
 

School is a community where learning is treasured.  Our goal is to inspire students to
 
become passionate, life
-
long learners 
who contribute to their communities as creative, ethical leaders.  We believe in excellence as a result of teachers, staff, 
and parents collaborating to develop a comprehensive core curriculum to support students in m
astering and exceeding 
grade
-
level standards.  Our curriculum is enriched through the integration of the arts and technology to foster inquiry and 
build expertise for the 21st Century.  We are committed to providing a safe, respectful, and caring environme
nt where 
students realize their potential in an inspirational, learning community.
