School Description
 
Sierra Linda Elementary is committed to the development and maintenance of a strong partnership 
between families and educators in our ongoing quest to provide a quality educational program for 

 
and parents working closely 
together as partners in education. Within this partnership, we must continuously strive to empower 
students to read with enthusiasm and understanding, write with clarity and expression, articulate 
in an intelligent manner, and 
demonstrate proficiency in the areas of computation, critical thinking, 
and problem solving.
 
 
Our entire staff at Sierra Linda Elementary has earned respect in our community for its ongoing 
commitment toward providing both quality education and a safe 
school environment for all

tools which will enable them to be productive, successful citizens in the years ahead. At Sierra Linda 
Elementary, we firmly support
 
the following statements:

children do not learn in the same way or at the same time, our staff is committed toward providing 
a variety of instructional stra
tegies to meet the diverse social, emotional, physical and academic 
needs of each child.
 
2. All students want, need, and deserve a safe and orderly environment in which to learn.
 
3. All students need to understand that learning can be applied to real
-
life 
situations and that our 
educational goal is to encourage life
-
long learning.
 
4. All students need support for learning from parents in the home environment. Our school 
community is proud of its commitment from parents and staff to work together for the ben
efit of

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The 
SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), whi
ch describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

C. Engagement
 
 
State 
Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each scho
ol site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Sierra Linda Elementary has many different opportunities for parent involvement.  Our Parent Teacher Association (PTA) is ver
y active in supporting 
classrooms, student incentives and sch
ool
-
wide activities. PTA has increased it's membership throughout the last two years. Parents are encouraged to 
volunteer in classrooms and at school events throughout the year. All parents are encouraged to become members.  All money ge
nerated from 
member
ship fee and school fundraisers returns to students/classrooms.
 
 
Parents are also encouraged to become a part of our School Site Council (SSC).  The School Site Council (SSC) is comprised of
 
five parents and five staff 
members. Nomination and voting occurs
 
during September/October of every school year. Our parent group is representative of our population and spans 
grade level interests as well. All parents are welcomed to attend SSC meetings.
 
 
Our ELAC is a strong group on campus, at the district office lev
el, and within the community.  This group focuses on the needs of our English Learners 
and works to inform and educate other parents how we are meeting the students' needs.  Our ELAC parent group meets monthly an
d topics cover a 
range of interest.
 
 
Sierra 
Linda also provides parents the opportunity to come to "Coffee With the Principal".  During these meetings, the topics vary b
ased on the interests 
of the parents from year to year.
 
 
We have a unique parent group created to provide support to parents and st
udents with special needs. The goal of our Special Education Parent Advisory 
Committee is to share ideas and strengthen each other. Staff will present workshops on various topics such as behavior manage
ment and strategies to 
work with their children in Rea
ding and Math.  The parents will serve as a resource to each other and be introduced to district and county resources.
 
 
Parents and community members may contact school office for more information on all meetings. Agendas for all meetings are po
sted on inf
ormation 
board in school's main office.

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern at Sierra Linda Elementary. Supervision is provided to ensure the safet

To safeguard the well

being of students and staff, a
 
comprehensive School Site Safety Plan has been developed by the Safety Committee, comprised of 
classified staff, teachers, and the principal. The Safety Plan is updated annually in the fall. All revisions and updates are
 
reviewed with the staff and 
presen
ted during ELAC, SSC, and Coffee with the Principal meetings. Key elements of the Safety Plan focus on the visitor policy, em
ergency materials, 
and evacuation procedures.
 
 
The school is always in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining 
to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. Safety drills 
are held on a regular basis. For example, fire drills are held monthly, earthquake drills are held once a year, and campus se
curity  drills are held yearly.
