By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our mission is for Grimmway Academy Shafter, a K
-
6 public school, to close the achievement gap for students in the rural 
areas of Kern County by creating an environment for student excellence and well
-
being.  Grimmway Academy Shafter will 
t
ransform the educational landscape for students in the rural areas of Kern County by providing a model of excellence and 
innovation leading to college readiness and lifelong success.
 
 
The GA model is based is based on a blended learning approach, where con
cepts from the core curriculum are reinforced 
across a variety of different learning experiences.  From fractions to history, to the life cycle of insects and plants, stud
ents 
learn concepts from their teachers in the classroom, experience them first
-
hand 
in the edible schoolyard and kitchen 
classroom, and work independently, at their own pace, using the latest technology in the school's Learning Labs. As part 
of our edible schoolyard program, students learn to grow and prepare healthy foods, while also dev
eloping life
-
enhancing 
skills, such as cooperation, collaboration, personal expression, and environmental stewardship.  We expect great things 
for our students, parents, teachers, and staff, and strive to ensure a supportive learning environment for everyo
ne.  Small 
class sizes help to ensure that our highly skilled teachers can focus on the individual needs of each Grimmway Academy 
student.
 
 
Students receive two fresh and seasonal meals each day, prepared by our Chefs and nutrition experts in the Grimmway 
Cafe, where they also learn healthy eating habits and develop positive attitudes to trying new foods.  Grimmway Academy 
also offers an afterschool enrichment program where art, music, homework assistance, crafts, and soccer clinics are 
available to all stu
dents.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Grimmway Academy provides the same standards as other public schools: we accept all students; tuition is free; our 
students participate in state tests; we teach core academic curricilum; and our teachers have the same teaching 
credentials. Our advantage li
es in our flexibility and autonomy to build an academic model that addresses the distinctive 
needs of our community. We provide small class sizes and highly skilled teachers who focus on the individual needs of 
each student.
 
 
We do offer a unique blended l
earning model to all students. This model reinforces core curriculum across a variety of 
learning environments and experiences. Students tackle concepts with their teachers in the classroom, work 
independently to reinforce these concepts using the latest t
echnology in our Learning Lab. Students also rotate through 
Art, Physical Education and Music.
 
 
Title I funds are used to support core academics in the Learning Lab by providing supplemental learning, intervention with 
at
-
risk students, professional develo
pment for teachers and staff, and parental involvement.

Professional Development (Most Recent Three Years)
 
 
Grimmway Academy Shafter believes that a strong adult learning program is essential to developing t
eachers and student 
achievement. The school calendar is designed to have shortened days every Friday dedicated to adult learning. In addition, 
there are 15 days of adult learning in the summer, two at the end of every quarter, and five during the winter br
eak. Three 
times a year the Shafter and Arvin campuses review common interim data and set priorities for learning. Grimmway 
Academy Shafter has established a balanced adult learning program with four main components: data analysis and 
curricular planning, 
instructional best practices, solutions teams and personalized adult learning. Professional learning has 
three point of emphasis; engagement, rigor, and assessment.
 
 
Professional learning is also embedded throughout the school day. Teachers have a 75 minut
e preparation each day. Once 
a week during prep the teachers meet in a department PLC (professional learning community) focused on inquiry 
questions and analyzing student work. Another day during prep teachers meet with an instructional coach to plan and 
r
eview lessons. Every two weeks teachers meet either the principal or assistant principal of instruction to review academic 
data and their personalized educator plans.
 
 
Grimmway Academy Shafter also partners with high quality organizations to enhance profes
sional learning for teachers. 
Two Teacher Leads (TLs) have on
-
going training through the Loyola Marymount Center for Math and Science Teaching 
(CMAST). STEM teachers work with TLs to plan, review observations, and participate in PLCs and professional 
devel
opment. All elementary school teachers work with Success For All coaches on literacy instruction. Through a 
partnership with the New Teacher Center, teacher coaches receive ongoing training and support.
