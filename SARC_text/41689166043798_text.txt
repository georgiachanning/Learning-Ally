By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
FDR K
-
8 School is located in the southwest corner of Daly City, bordering Pacifica. We serve students in Daly City and 
Pacifica.
 
 
We are the only K
-
8 school in the Jefferson Elementary School Distri
ct. Our small class sizes and safe, caring elementary 
environment continues through our middle school. We strive for excellence and innovation in academics, music, 
technology, and partnership with our families and community.
 
 
Our mission at F. D. Roosevelt
 
K
-
8 is to provide all students with a high quality education that is developmentally, 
academically, emotionally, and socially appropriate. We strive to prepare our students to be well
-
rounded, respectful and 
confident citizens.
 
 
Twenty
-
three teachers prov
ide academic instruction to 380 general and special education students. Among FDR's diverse 
student population 34.8% are Filipino, 27.3% are Hispanic, 17% are Asian, 7.4% are White (non
-
 
Hispanic), and 3.5% are 
African
-
American. This population also includ
es socioeconomic disadvantaged students, English Learners, and students 
with disabilities. 58.9% of our students also participate in the free and reduced lunch program. The majority of FDR's 
students live in walking distance to school, some students take p
ublic transportation to school, and many of the special 
education students
 
are bussed to FDR from other parts of Daly City.
 
 
FDR offers after
-
school programs which provide additional academic support to our students. The after
-
school programs 
include: Latchkey (before and after school child care), tutoring and science
-
based enrichment, Peninsula Partnership 
Enrichment programs (robotics and coding), Extended Day Care, and the After School Think Together program.
 
 
The SARC is available on the 
district website at www.jsd.k12.ca.us and can be made available in hard copy upon request. 
Please contact the school at 650

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Jefferson Elementary School District Maintenance Department, in conjunction with the site day and night custodians, 
makes every effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and in good repair. The grounds are maintained on a regular 
basis. Needed
 
repairs and maintenance projects are completed in a timely manner. School facilities are upgraded 
whenever possible to support and maintain a safe, clean and secure campus.
 
 
The FDR facilities are in good shape. The classrooms, office and Multi
-
Purpose Ro
om are handicapped accessible. In the 
summer of 2006 a lift was installed in the Multi
-
Use
-
Room enabling students in wheel chairs access to the stage. In the 
spring of 2007 a chain link fence was installed around the large playground ensuring the safety of
 
the students. New 
playground equipment was also installed in both the large and kindergarten playgrounds 2 years ago. In the summer of 
2007 new flooring was installed throughout the school. In December 2013, the Multi
-
use room was painted. In the summer 
o
f 2017, the front office was remodeled to accommodate a more welcoming and workable space.
 
 
Due to our close proximity to the Pacific Ocean the perimeter chain
-
link fences are in constant need of repair. The District 
maintenance personnel are quick to repa
ir these fences. During the past couple of summers new lighting has been 
installed throughout the buildings. In addition, the student and adult restrooms have been upgraded with new fixtures, 
tile, and commodes. In the summer of 2011 the entire school and 
Latchkey Portables were re
-
roofed. The ramps to Room 
21 and the Latchkey Portables were replaced during the summer of 2013. Solar panels were installed in the fall of 2013.
 
 
Data reported are the determination of good repair as documented in a completed Fa
cilities Inspection Tool (FIT) 
conducted every year. The most recent inspection was conducted in August 2018. Additional information about the 
condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by speaking with the school principal.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number 
of students wh

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The FDR staff strives to provide a learning environment that is safe, healthy and 
encouraging. The instructional programs 
are designed to prepare all students in becoming self
-
directed learners by emphasizing the acquisition and application of 
knowledge and skills, the development of critical thinking skills, and the mastery of higher l
evel reasoning skills. Classroom 
incentive programs, and school assemblies are a few of the programs which the staff uses to impart these skills. A Positive 
Behavior Intervention System of Support team has been meets regularly to analyze discipline data an
d guide the 
development of strategies and routines that promote positive, safe, responsible, and respectful behaviors school
-
wide.
 
 
FDR has a detailed Comprehensive Safe School Plan that outlines protocols, systems, and procedures in the event of an 
emerge
ncy and/or disaster. Each year the Safe School Plan is reviewed/updated by the FDR Safety Committee and 
presented to the staff and parents. Fire drills and disaster procedures outlined in this plan are regularly updated and 
practiced. Safety programs inclu
de, but are not limited to, drug awareness and personal safety. All required drills are 
calendared and the results are shared with the staff. Some of the other areas covered in this Plan are FDR's Behavior 
Policy, Dress Code, protocols for safety/emergency
 
drills, Attendance policy, Harassment Policy, and Internet Safety Policy.
