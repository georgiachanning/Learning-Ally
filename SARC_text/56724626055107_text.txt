Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
At Bard School, our custodial and grounds
 
staff take great pride in maintaining organized, clean and safe facilities. District 
Administration and the Governing Board have placed a great emphasis on campus safety and security. Together, school 
and District personnel work to ensure that the facilit
y is maintained in a manner that assures that it is clean, safe and 
functional as determined pursuant to an interim evaluation instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public 
School Construction. An emergency plan has been implemented at e
ach site. The primary purpose of this plan is to prepare 
the staff and students to cope with disasters and to protect life and property after a disaster. Regular fire, earthquake and
 
intruder drills are conducted.
 
 
Bard School has embraced technology and a
ll our classrooms have computers for students and teachers and Smart TVs 
that are networked with access to the Internet for teacher
-
supervised projects. Wireless access points have been added 
to the campus for easy access for mobile devices.  We have incor
porated one to one technology in over half of our 
classrooms through the use of either iPads or Chromebooks.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the
 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stu
dents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administr
ation of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfull
y completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents and guardians of 
students attending Bard School are encouraged and invited to support our school
-
wide program. 
They are invited to volunteer in the classroom and frequent home
-
school communication occurs to keep our families 
informed of events at school.  Parents serve on 
PTA and organize fundraisers, Book Fairs, and student and staff 
appreciation events. They also volunteer their time to support teachers in the classroom. At Bard, parents recognize their 

t both financially and with their time. Parents are 
welcome to stay at our monthly flag gatherings and administration holds a "Coffee with the Principal" each month to 
connect with parents.
 
 
If you are interested and available to volunteer your time, feel 
free to contact your child's teacher or the principal at 805

Richard Bard Elementary School strives to maintain a safe, healthful, nurturing and orderly school campus that encourages 
positive attitudes in
 
students and staff. A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-
free.
 
 
Bard's Safe School Plan for 2019

2020 was reviewed and updated. Key elements of the plan include C.H.A.M.P.S. 
(Conversation, Help, Activity, 
Movement, Participation, Successful Students) Positive Behavior Support System, Character 
Education Program, monthly fire, earthquake and evacuation drills, and emergency and supply kits that are provided for 
each classroom. A yearly lock down drill is con
ducted with the local police department to simulate an active shooter event.  
Staff has been trained by the Oxnard Police Department in practices that help ensure the safety of students and staff in 
the event of an active shooter situation. Additionally, a
s part of our school safety plan we ordered and provided walkie
-
talkies for all of our teachers and support staff.

C.H.A.M.P.S. Program (Conversation, Help, Activity, Movement, Participation, Successful Students)
 
Professional development is offered during the teaching day, on three student
-

summer insti
tutes, after school, and on weekends. Substitute teachers are provided and the negotiated hourly rate is 
offered for attendance.
 
 
During the school year, teachers are supported by classroom observations, staff meetings, and grade

reading/language arts and mathematics, student performance data is ongoing and evaluated using a common assessment. 
A Student Progress Report aligned to the C
alifornia Common Core State Standards is sent to parents at the end of each 
trimester.
