School Description
 
It is my pleasure to introduce this annual School Accountability Report Card. The data and 
information contained within these pages will prove useful in informing you about our school, 
including but not limited to academic standings, cur
riculum and instruction, school facilities and 
safety, budget, and facility enhancement. As you read our School Accountability Report Card, you 
will see a school that ensures every child has equal access to a rigorous core curriculum in language 
arts, math
ematics, science, and social studies. The hard
-
working staff is both skilled and dedicated 
to the success of our students.
 
 
Our goal in presenting you with this information is to keep our community well informed. If you 
have any questions or are interested
 
in making an appointment to discuss this report, please call 
our school.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School 
Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our school provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. Classrooms, bathrooms, and general areas a
re in good repair and 
receive basic cleaning on a daily basis. Deta
iled cleaning is done during vacation periods. The district provides maintenance services on a regular schedule 
or when an emergency occurs.
 
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors are pr
oactive and conduct inspections at 
school sites on a continual basis. The District administers a scheduled maintenance program to ensure a suitable learning env
ironment. At the time this 
report was published, all restrooms on campus were in good working or
der. Daily reports of incidents that require repair at the school sites are processed 
through work orders. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The remaining incidents are handled on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis to ensure 
efficient service
.
 
 
The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building compone
nts. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, 

rred maintenance plan is available 
at the district office.
 
 
To determine the condit
ion of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the 
Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction.
 
 

questions you see on this report. Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of 
the date of the report. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summ
ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number 
of students who participated in both assessments.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi

DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool loc
ated on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQ
uest is a dynamic system that provides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regardin
g English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at 
public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Interne
t at 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include t
he hours of operation, the length 
of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation
, and the ability to print 
documents.

School Safety Plan
 

 
ensuring student and staff 
safety during a disaster. Monthly fire drills and disaster drop drills are conducted on a regular basis
 
throughout the school year. A storage bin contains 
food, water, and other supplies for use during a disaster.
 
 
Our school is a closed campus. All visitors are required to sign
-

strators and 
other campus supervisors monitor activity and ensure student safety.
 
 
A Comprehensive School Safety Plan, which is reviewed annually, was developed by the school staff to provide students and sta
ff a means to ensure a 
safe and orderly learning
 
environment. Components of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan include: child abuse reporting procedures, teacher 
notification of dangerous pupils procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe arrival and departure from sch
ool, sexual har
assment 
policy, suspension and expulsion policies, dress code, and discipline policies. The school safety committee and district pers
onnel evaluate the plan 
annually and update the plan as needed. The Comprehensive School Safety Plan was revised in October
