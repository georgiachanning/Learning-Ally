Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are encouraged 
to take an active role in their child's education while they are enrolled at Wasuma Elementary 
School. Parent Volunteers are encouraged to work in the classrooms with both individuals and small groups of students. 
For volunteers who are interested, a Paren
t Volunteer Application can be picked up from the school office. The Wasuma 
Parent Teacher Association is  very active in promoting activities that benefit the entire student population. They hold a 
variety of fundraisers that support classroom instruction
 
and allow teachers to provide those "extras" that make the 
educational experience at Wasuma unique. Communication with the Wasuma community takes place regularly. A monthly 
newsletter, complete with a calendar of upcoming school events, is sent home each 
month. Parent/Teacher Conferences 
are held twice a year, allowing teachers and parents to discuss students' academic progress. Parents are provided with an 
Aeries Parent Portal account that allows them to consistently check their student's academic status.
 
All teachers use Class 
DoJo, an online behavior tracking and communication system, that provides parents with daily information. Wasuma staff 
and the PTA work together to maintain a FaceBook page dedicated to keeping Wasuma families in the loop on upcomin
g 
events & volunteer opportunities. The BlackBoard Connect telephone system is employed to keep parents informed of 
important events and schedule changes.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
A Comprehensive School Safety Plan has been established by the District. This plan is reviewed annually by district and 
site level administration and by the District Safety Officer. The plan 
contains all mandated information. In addition to this 
plan, at the site level, Wasuma reviews its safety procedures and performs regular safety and disaster drills. The Bass Lake 
School District currently contracts with Catapult Emergency Management Servi
ces to assist in providing real
-
time 
emergency communication capabilites.
 
 
Wasuma also recognizes that school safety is tied to school climate. We participate in annual mediation and behavior 
programs for staff and students to help create a positive, coope
rative climate on campus. The school is continuing to 
incorporate PBIS as a way to increase positive school environment. A full
