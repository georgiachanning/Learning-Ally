About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have
 
books in core classes for all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far mor
e meaningful when along with 
the more detailed description of textbooks conta

in our core classes and their dates of publication.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in go

work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered
 
by the district to ensure that all classrooms, restrooms, and facilities are well

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., Calif
ornia Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California 
State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

s 
calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students w
ho met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total numbe
r of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student
 
privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. T
he achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who received scores.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Schoo
l Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 

todial team ensures the school facilities 
are in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. Each year a deep cleaning process occurs during  
the summer or other extended 
breaks.  In the event of a facility plant emergency, the pri
ncipal notifies appropriate site and district personnel to resolve the emergency and safely secure 
or evacuate the students, based upon the site and district emergency preparedness plans. A site review with the district Inte
rnal Evaluation Instrument 
(IEI)
 
occurs annually.
 
 
A comprehensive School Safety Plan, which was recently reviewed by the School Site Council, helps to provide a secure, peacef
ul and clean environment 

 
to follow during emergencies and natural disasters. Emergency 
drills are conducted on a regular basis.
 
 
Every effort is made to ensure students are monitored while on campus throughout the school day.  The campus security along w
ith yard supervisors, 
teac
hers, site administrators and school staff provide supervision for students before and during school. The playground is safe 
for all students. All visitors 
must sign in at the office and receive proper authorization to be on campus, and must display their 
passes at all times.
