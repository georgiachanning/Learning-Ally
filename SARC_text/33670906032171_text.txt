Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

6 elementary schools in the Jurupa Unified School District, and is 
located in Jurupa Valley, CA. The population of our community is very mo
bile. The majority of the students live within 
walking distance of the school in apartments, mobile home parks or rented homes, which contributes to a high transient 
rate. Ina Arbuckle Elementary School is located in one of several communities in the city 
of Jurupa Valley served by the 
Jurupa Unified School District, a district of approximately 20,000 students. Ethnic distribution is 91% Hispanic, 5% African

approximately 500 
transitional kindergarten through sixth grade regular education students, 12 SDC Pre

of students are English learners.

which include, but are not limited to: G.A.T.E., Least Restrictive Environment, Positive Behavior Int
ervention Support 
(PBIS), Classroom Management, Student Study Team (Tier I/II Interventions), Restorative Justice Practices, Technology

Year and 
month in which data were collected:
 
September 27, 2019
 
 
Jurupa Unified School District conducts an evaluation of instructional materials to adopt materials that best meet the 
needs of students. The district conducts adoptions on a districtwide basis. The r
eview process includes a committee of a 
majority of classroom teachers in the appropriate discipline (Education Code Section 60210). In addition, all instructional 
materials are in compliance with social content standards. When making adoption decisions, t
he adoption committee uses 
the content standards, the curriculum frameworks, the State Board of Education
-
adopted evaluation criteria, and the 
reports on each adoption as resources. The final decision for selecting and recommending textbook adoptions is wi
th the 
adoption committee. The most recently adopted textbooks were selected from the state
-
approved list.
 
 
All students, including English learners, have standards
-
aligned textbooks checked out to them, to use in class and to take 
home, in each of the cor
e curriculum areas of reading/language arts, mathematics, science and history/social science; 
foreign language and health; visual and performing arts; and science laboratory equipment for grades nine through twelve 
as appropriate.
 
 
Elementary students rece
ive core curriculum textbooks on the first day of enrollment.  Middle school and high school 
students receive textbooks checked out to them at registration days a few days before the first day of school.  All students 
enrolling after the first day of schoo
l have core curriculum textbooks checked out to them by the Library Clerk on their 
first day of enrollment.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement 
(Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate As
sessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement stan
dards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the Uni
versity of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parent 
Involvement is a priority. Ina Arbuckle works actively to increase parent participation as a strategy for increasing 
student achievement. The Parent Policy includes the following elements: an annual meeting of parents will be held to 
describe the school si
tes Title I program; opportunities to participate in the planning, review and improvement of the Title 
I program through DAC, DELAC, SSC, ELAC, and PTA; school communication about the Title I programs will be distributed 
in all the major languages spoken b
y the families of the students at the school; assessment information reflecting student 
academic progress will be shared with parents at parent/teacher conferences in the fall; school leaders will determine 
who is responsible for the coordination of parent
 
involvement activities at the site; training for meaningful parent 
involvement will be provided; appropriate roles for community organizations will be developed; and surveys will be 
conducted to assess needs and to evaluate the effectiveness of the parent
 
involvement activities. Our parent involvement 
focus is based on the National Standards for Parent/Family Involvement: Parenting, Communicating, Volunteering, 
Learning and Home, Decision Making and Advocacy, Collaborating with Community, and Relationship 
Building.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Ina Arbuckle Elementary's comprehensive school safety plan was designed to be utilized as a school resource for 
prevention/mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery planning and training as well as functioning as a template 
for meeting the requiremen
ts for the annual Safety Plan Process under SB 187 and the National Incident Management 
System. The document is designed as a living document to be updated as necessary to meet site, district and community 
needs, forms, or requirements. The plan addresses 
school crime, mandated policies and procedures, child abuse reporting 
and prevention, suspension and expulsion and due process, staff notification of dangerous students, campus safety, school 
discipline, sexual harassment policy, discrimination and other h
arassment policy, dress code policy, drug free 
expectations, parent involvement strategies, prevention and intervention strategies, emergency and disaster response 
and procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress, emergency evacuation routes and proc
edures, drills, medical 
emergencies, and mass casualty procedures. Most importantly, the plan address the needs of the school and students and 
considers the following three essential components in accordance with Ed. Code 35294.21: 1) Assures each student 
a safe 
physical environment, 2) assures each student a safe respectful, accepting, and emotionally nurturing environment, and 
3) develops each student's resiliency skills.
 
 
The school safety plan was last reviewed, discussed, and updated in March 2019.
