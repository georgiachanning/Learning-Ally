By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Indian Creek Elementary is located in Placerville, Califor
nia, 32 miles east of Sacramento, in the beautiful foothills of the 
Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. Indian Creek is located adjacent to the El Dorado County Office of Education near the 
intersection of Missouri Flat Road and Green Valley Road. The beautifull
y manicured landscape, gorgeous trees, and 
student gardens make our school an inviting place to learn. The office, equipped with an old
-
fashioned school bell, faces 

 
 
Indian Creek Priorities
 
The Mother Lode U
nion School District and Indian Creek have established the following five priorities.
 
We are committed to advancing academic achievement for all students.
 
We are committed to meeting the educational needs of each student while providing a safe, respectful 
and connected 
school experience.
 
We are committed to nurturing partnerships with students, staff, parents, and community.
 
We are committed to providing employees with the resources necessary to perform their function while maintaining a 
fiscally responsibl
e organization.
 
We are committed to employing committed, competent and caring staff who believe in respect for others, teamwork, 
continuous improvement and that all students can learn and be successful.
 
 
We are committed to building an academic foundation 
that challenges students through curriculum aligned to the 
Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  The use of technology is an integral instructional element.  All first through fourth 
grade classes have class sets of Chromebooks.  We also have two dedicated 
computer labs providing students the 
opportunity to research, create documents and learn 21st century technology skills.  Our kindergarten and transitional 
kindergarten classrooms have between five and 7 mini Ipads for small group skill practice and share 
a class set of 
touchscreen Chromebooks for whole class technology instruction.  Every student has access to technology every day. 
There are online components to our curriculum providing students the opportunity to interact with the texts online or 
through 
a hard copy.   Teachers can also administer some assessments online giving students and staff immediate 
feedback, allowing for real
-
time adjustment of instruction to meet student need.  We have a robust reading, math, and 
writing intervention plan, providi
ng leveled and strategic phonics support, with regrouping based on assessment data 
approximately every nine weeks.  LCAP instructional aides assist classroom teachers with academic intervention through 
Walk to Learn and push
-
in classroom support for every 
classroom.  Our Title 1 teacher provides strategic, context
-
embedded pull out and push
-
in support for students based on assessment data.
 
 
Parental and community involvement is a critical component at Indian Creek.  Numerous volunteers are on campus daily, 
supporting the learning and assisting both inside and outside the classrooms.  Regular evening events are calendared to 
bring our families together.  Reading Nights bring children out in their pajamas once a trimester to hear themed stories, 
do a craft, an
d pick out a book to take home.  Our monthly outdoor flag salutes bring the entire student body together on 
the last Friday morning of each month.  Several enriching assemblies are also integral to instilling a love of learning and 
reinforcing the concept 
that Character Counts .  We have a supportive Parent Teacher Club that hosts numerous events 
during the school year including a Harvest Festival, Walk a thon, and Pancakes with Santa event each year.  Positive student 
behavior is celebrated with "Eagle Awa
rds", positive postcards home, classroom incentives, character awards, personal 
success awards, Eagle of the trimester awards, and Sportsmanship awards.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State prio
rity: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education 
population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
a
re aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisf
y the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents and 
community members play an important role in the success of Indian Creek students. The partnership between 
the dedicated and hard working volunteers and staff is commendable. An active Parent Teacher Club coordinates 
numerous fundraisers over the course of 
the year to support enrichment, including field trips to Marshall Gold Discovery 
Park and the California State Capital. Students explore the rich history of our area throughout their school career at Indian
 
Creek.
 
Back to School Night is held shortly after
 
school starts in the fall.  Parents can meet teachers and learn about classroom 
routines and policies as well as individual classroom volunteer opportunities.  Indian Creek holds parent teacher 
conferences two times during the school year and throughout t
he school year as needed.   At the end of each year families 
are invited to Open House in the evening to tour classrooms and see a variety of student work showcased. Parents can 
stay informed through our school website, Student Handbook, and monthly newsle
tters.
 
 
Indian Creek Elementary greatly benefits from its supportive parents who volunteer in the classroom and in other roles 
such as members of the Parent Teacher Club (PTC), School Site Council/English Language Advisory Committee (SSC/ELAC), 
and as clas
sroom Art Docents. The school also benefits from several community partnerships, including the local Rotary 

Nutrition Program, as well as r
etail merchants such as WalMart, Target, SaveMart, and Raley's.

grade students as needed based on assessment data
.  Read Live is used to provide vocabulary, comprehension,and fluency 
support for targeted students based on assessment data.  Our Title 1 teacher uses all  available data under the direction 
of the principal to provide specific, targeted instruction and i
ntervention to students during the school day. Each classroom 
gets assigned LCAP instructional aide services to provide support for struggling students. Other intervention programs 
consist of reading, writing and math interventions by grade level and stude
nt need targeting specific skills. Accelerated 
Reader is used to set reading goals for students and gauge student reading level and growth. Social skllls groups are formed 
based on school data and are taught by our school counselor and counseling interns.

As part of the growth process, opportunities for training and staff development are provided at both the district and 
individual school sites to 
administrators, teachers, and classified staff. The district offers early release Wednesdays for 
Structured Collaboration Time and staff development. Faculty meet each Wednesday to work in grade level teams and as 
an entire staff to review student data, de
termine Common Core implementation strategies, explore teaching 
strategies/methodologies, and to share best practices.   Additionally, weekly Collaboration allows staff to apply their 
trainings, to analyze data, to strategize instructional units, and to ad
dress student concerns. In addition the district has 
three minimum days for staff development annually where staff members are provided professional growth opportunities 
in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.
 
.
 
During the 2018
-
2019 school y
ear, staff participated in a variety of professional development, including but not limited to 
monthly Love and Logic trainings and growth mindset trainings. The district and school participated in the Rural 
Professional Development Network facilitated by 
the El Dorado County Office of Education. The network focused on 
improving the math success of students and growth mindset. School districts in the county work together to share 
practices, observe each other, and develop action plans to increase student su
ccess. A team of teachers and administration 
went to a professional development provided by the Center for interactive Learning and Collaboration on exploring our 
math curriculum and ways to enhance it. That team recommended math planning days for each gra
de level to use research 
about the math curriculum and plan activities and lessons to address areas of more instructional need. At biweekly staff 
meetings and the three minimum day staff development days, staff learned more about Universal Design for Learn
ing. 
Staff learned how to make lessons more accessible and engaging for all learners.
 
 
In 2019
-
2020, each grade level team had a day of math planning as mentioned above. Indian Creek sent a team to EPIC (El 
Dorado Professional Improvement Community). This 
professional learning community focuses on change research, 
studying school and district data, and recommending actions to address student need.
