Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional through proper facilities 
maintenance and campus supervision. Ongoing 
maintenance and campus improvements ensure facilities remain up to 
date and provide adequate space for students and staff. District maintenance and site custodial staff ensure that the 
repairs necessary to keep the school in good condition are completed in
 
a timely manner. A work order process is used by 
school and district staff to communicate non
-
routine maintenance requests. Emergency repairs are given the highest 
priority. Classrooms and other school facilities were modernized in 2009. Solar Ready repla
cement lunch court structures 
were installed in 2017.

All training and curriculum development activities at Carlton Hills School support the implementation of Common Core 
Content Standards and State curricular 
frameworks. Teachers annually receive between 75
-
85 days of professional 
development at the site and/or district level. Decisions concerning selection of staff development activities are performed 
by the principal, district administrators, and grade level 
representatives using tools such as teacher input, district 
benchmark results, data analysis, and focus groups to determine the areas in which additional teacher training may 
enhance classroom instruction and increase student achievement levels. Carlton Hi
lls School offers support to new and 
veteran teachers through peer coaching and mentoring. All staff are encouraged to attend professional workshops and 
conferences including GLADD, CGI, Restorative Practices, Open Sci
-
Ed, and CPI. Approximately 70% of our
 
Staff 
Development is done on a partial day and approximately 30% is a full day of Staff Development.  Classified support staff 
receive job related training from department supervisors and district representatives.
