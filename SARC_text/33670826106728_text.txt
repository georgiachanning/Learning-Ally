ear 
Parents/Guardians/Community Members,
 
 
Welcome to Valle Vista Elementary School of Hemet Unified! We take great pride in our school and 
believe it is one of the finest elementary schools in the San Jacinto Valley. We have a very dedicated 
staff who believes 
that ALL children can learn. Various intervention and enrichment programs are 
offered throughout the year aimed at meeting the needs of all students. We offer an English 
Language Development program in grades TK
-
5. Students are prepared for the technology 
age by 
means of 1
-
1 technology for all students and more than half our classrooms have SmartBoard 
interactive whiteboards and/or promethium boards.  Additionally, we offer our students access to 
computer
-
based enrichment and intervention programs for both 
at school and at home, such as 
Imagine Learning, Imagine Learning Math, ST Math, and Accelerated Reader.
 
 
We are looking forward to a very productive year in which all our Viking students are successful. 
Teachers and students work diligently with California
 
State Standards
-
based curriculum and 
SmarterBalanced assessment programs. One of our goals this year is to continue to improve on our 
past successes and ensure a high level of achievement for all students. With our experienced staff 
and supportive parents
, we believe that we can, not only accomplish our goals, but exceed them.
 
 
In order to support a safe and welcoming school environment, we practiced school
-
wide Positive 
Behavior Interventions and Supports, where we set explicit expectations for our student
s, teach 
necessary skills to meet those expectations, and positively reinforce when expectations are being 
met.
 
We encourage all parents to become active in their child's education. This can be accomplished 
through volunteering, attending 
parent
-
teacher conferences, open house, back to school night, and 
other evening events. Your involvement is critical in the success of your child. I look forward to 
meeting and working with our parents and community, and if you would ever like, please stop
 
by 
the school, visit our school website at vallevista.hemetusd.org, send an email, or call us at (951) 
927
-
0800.
 
 
Our Mission:  Valle Vista's mission is to create a culture of universal achievement.
 
 
Our Vision:  At Valle Vista Elementary, we envision a c
lean, safe, and respectful environment with 
happy, enthusiastic children who are supported both by involved families and highly qualified and 
engaged staff, in an effort to achieve common educational goals.
 
 
Our Core Values:
 
1. We believe it is the 
student's, parent's, staff's, and community's responsibility to ensure every 
student, with appropriate support, becomes successful, lifelong learner.
 
2. We believe all students have the right to a safe, orderly, supportive and positive school 
environment.
 
3. We believe in the power of collaboration among and between grade levels.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality,

-

A District committee considers textbooks for recommendation on a cycle established by the State Board of Education and from a
 
State adopted list.  The 
committee meets to 
discuss current issues relevant to the subject matter, including student success, previously used textbooks, and instructiona
l 
methods.  The committee reviews demonstration copies of proposed textbooks, as well as listen to representatives describe the
 
var
ious highlights of the 
available materials.  The review is followed by a pilot of materials that results in consensus by the committee of a recommen
ded textbook.  The textbook 
is forwarded to a K
-
12 Curriculum Council, which consists of teachers, parents, 
and community stakeholders, for review and approval.  If the textbook is 
approved by the K
-
12 Curriculum Council, the textbook is forwarded to the Superintendent and the Governing Board for their review and approval.
  
Each 
pupil in the district, including 
English learners, kindergarten through grade twelve, is provided with standards
-
aligned textbooks or basic instructional 
materials that are consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framework adopted by the State Board.
 
 
AB 1246, added Educa
tion Code Section 60210, which allows the district to use any instructional materials, not just state
-
adopted, as long as they are 
aligned with the academic content standards.  The EC 60119 has a new section (e) with a reference to the Common Core State St
andards (CCSS).  The 

content standards, it is the 
intent of the Legislature that textbooks, instructional materials, and supplement
al instructional materials be deemed to be aligned with the content 
standards pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (c), and be deemed consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framew
ork adopted by the state 
board pursuant to subdivision (a) if t
he textbooks, instructional materials, supplemental instructional materials, or a combination of any such materials 

ed to either th
e 1997 
standards or the 2010 CCSS standards for mathematics and English Language Arts are compliant with Williams Act requirements. 
 
In accordance with 
Education Code Section 60422(a) and 60119, the Governing Board certified on 9/3/2019 that each pupil in 
the district, including English learners, in 
kindergarten through grade twelve, has been provided with standards

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the Californi
a Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate ac
hievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether t
hey received a score or not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced 
Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the 
number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether t
hey received a score or not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.
