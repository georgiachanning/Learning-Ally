School Description
 
Welcome to Westlake Elementary School, home of the Wildcats. Westlake is dedicated to 
educating the whole child through a comprehensive visual and performing arts program, including 
visual arts, music, dance, and theater for students in kindergarten throug
h fifth grade.  Programs 
are made possible by parcel taxes and PTA donations.  Westlake Elementary School is known 
throughout the Santa Cruz area for its ongoing commitment to excellence.  This rich tradition and 
reputation is possible due to the hard work
 
of a dedicated and talented staff, the full participation 
of parents, and community involvement.
 
 
Westlake Elementary School is located on the northwest side of Santa Cruz, California, near the 
campus of the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC). 
 
In the academic year 2019
-
20, 
approximately 550 students were registered for transitional kindergarten through fifth grades.
 
 
In order to improve our student achievement, we have provided staff with assessment information 
of their current students.  The m
ost informative achievement data for classroom teachers are the 
local literacy and math assessments that are administered three times a year.  With this 
information, teachers are able to identify areas for improvement and set targets for academic 
achieveme
nt. Teachers work together in grade level teams and as a whole staff on continuous 
school improvement.
 
 
A positive school climate is a constant focus for Westlake. The Positive Behavior Instruction Systems 
(PBIS) program includes the four Wildcat Ways scho
ol expectations: Be Safe, Be Respectful, Be 
Responsible, and Do Your Personal Best.  There are also specific procedures, routines and rules for 
all areas of the school.  Positive behavior is reinforced through Cool Cat tickets.  They can be 
redeemed for it
ems from the student store and popcorn on Fridays.  The social emotional learning 
curriculum Second Step is taught TK
-
5 and the units of study are: skills for learning, problem solving, 
emotion management and empathy.  Together these programs help create a
 
safe, orderly and 
positive learning environment.
 
 
Westlake is dedicated to providing an enriched learning experience.  Students participate in the 
science fair, county spelling bee, county math league and county author's fair.   After school 
enrichment ac
tivities include skate dogs, Spanish, Chinese, math club, sports, young scientist 
program, and lunchtime chess.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contain
s information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes
 
how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the Smarter Balanced 
Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for En
glish langua
ge 
arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may particip
ate in the 
administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Co
mmon Core State Standards 
[CCSS] for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the Universi
ty of California and 
the 
California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs of study

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students w
ho met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by th
e total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to pr
otect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievem
ent level percentages are calculated using only students who received scores.
