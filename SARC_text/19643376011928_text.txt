By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our Mission
 
The mission of Thomas Jefferson Elementary
 
School is to build confident learners and responsible citizens who engage in 
a rigorous curriculum, express creative thinking, develop personal integrity and discover the joy of shared learning within 
a safe and supportive community.
 
 
Our School
 
Thomas Je
fferson is one of eleven premier elementary schools in the  Burbank Unified School District located in the 
southeast end of the San Fernando Valley. Thomas Jefferson Elementary was built in 1948 and modernized in 1999. 
Pathways and gardens designed through
 
a Caesar Chavez grant enhance our school. It is within this nurturing environment 
we serve approximately seven hundred fifty students who mainly come to us from homes representing upper
-
middle 
socioeconomic levels with low mobility rate. Jefferson serves 
many ethnic heritage groups.  Those listed as significant 
subgroups per our California State Test can be classified as follows:  57% White, 21% Hispanic, and 10% Asian.  Seven 
percent of our student population speak a language other than English. Twenty
-
tw
o percent of our students qualify for 
free or reduced price lunches and six percent of our students have been accepted into the Gifted and Talented Education 
(GATE) program.
 
 
Over the years, Jefferson has held a reputation of engaging learners in a rigorou
s and meaningful curriculum.  Our API 
scores continue to trend in a positive direction.  The most recent API score is 898. We can only attribute these positive 
trends towards highly skilled teachers that utilize strong strategies and instructional practice
s when implementing 
standards
-
based curriculum approved by the state and adopted by the district.  We have also continued our emphasis on 
timely data
-
driven instruction to meet the needs of all students.  We rise to the challenge of meeting the needs of st
udents 
who are performing below grade level to reaching those children who qualify for GATE through a system that we have 
labeled "Power Hour".  "Power Hour" is a program in which provide specific targeted instruction in English Language Arts 
and some math
.  Jefferson's comprehensive and balanced educational program enables all students to prosper 
academically, physically, and emotionally.
 
 
Staff and families partner to make Thomas Jefferson exceptional in every way. Each year our PTA sponsors activities su
ch 
as family picnics, Carnival, assemblies, field study trips, and holiday food drive. Booster Fundraising allows us to purchase
 
computers, books for our school library, a week of Outdoor Science School for fifth graders.  The efforts of all of our 
communi
ty stakeholders helps extend our dynamic standards
-
based arts curriculum to every child.
 
 
Thomas Jefferson Elementary is a school that has achieved much over the years and produced citizens with strong integrity 
and skills that we pride ourselves on in our
 
country.  We are very proud of these accomplishments, however, we always 
look to the future and that means that we continue to develop and improve our skills and instructional strategies so that 
our students make significant contributions to the world tha
t they will inherit; a world that seeks out those who can 
compete globally with strong discreet skills and the ability to problem solve for new horizons.

then, it never is 
afterwards. The fortune of our lives, therefore depends on employing well the short period of youth.  Jefferson students 
are self
-
motivators who practice disciplined thought and action.  They are reflective learners who set and achieve r
ealistic 
yet challenging goals.  They seek and discover the personal satisfaction in pursuing excellence.  Thomas Jefferson would 
be proud.

Thomas 
Jefferson himself was a strong believer in education for all. He espoused the idea of an "academical village" and 
we have created a place similar to his vision where shared learning is infused in our student's daily lives.   We strongly 
believe in and prac
tice "Educational Excellence for Every Child, Every Day." Our network of intimate connections 
-
 
comprised of students, teachers, administrators, support staff, parents, community partners, and neighbors 
-
 
work and 
learn together to make this vision a reali
ty.
 
 
Jefferson offers a plethora of ways parents and other community members can be involved in educating our students.  
Parents volunteer and support teachers within the classroom.  We train parents to work with reading strategies that are 
known to suppor
t student learning.  We have very active  parent groups in the form of  PTA, a Booster Association, School 
Site Council, and English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC). These groups play an important role in involving families 
and community members in scho
ol activities. The Jefferson PTA coordinates a wide variety of opportunities for parental 
involvement. Along with PTA, we host a school visits for families new to our area, a Kindergarten Orientation, "Sneak 
Peek", and Kindergarten parent reception on the 
first day of school.  We also host a New Parent meeting for all parents 
prior to one of the first PTA meetings.  PTA also hosts a multicultural evening that includes traditions from many cultures 
important to our school.   Home/School communication is prov
ided by the Patriot Press newsletter and flyers that go 
home.  Events such as the annual Fall Picnic, Book Fairs, Art Days, Campus Pride Days and Spring Carnival bring our 
community of families together. In short, opportunities are endless!
