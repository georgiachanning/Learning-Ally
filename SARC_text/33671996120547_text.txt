By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Enchanted Hills Elementary School consists of 20 permanent classrooms, three permanent county classrooms, and six 
portable 
buildings. The media center, the multipurpose room, and the administrative offices are also in modular buildings.
 
 
The school site is inspected regularly to ensure that we comply with all state requirements. A custodial staff attends to 
the regular and pre
ventive maintenance of the school site. They clean each classroom, the rest rooms, and the offices 
daily. District maintenance removes graffiti and maintains landscaping on a weekly basis.
 
 
We added Drip Irrigation to our landscaping to help maintain appea
rance and we are in the process of landscaping our 
curb planters in the front of our school.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by 
the Williams legislation of 2004. What y
ou will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their 
structural integrity, electrical systems, heating and ventilation systems, and more. The important purpose of this 
assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds ar
e safe and in good repair. If anything needs to be repaired, this 
assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for this assessment 
were written by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and w
ere brought about by the Williams legislation. You 
can look at the six
-
page Facilities Inspection Tool used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to
 
inspect them. They used a 

e 
answered the questions you see on this report. Please note that the information reflects the condition
 
of our buildings as 
of the date of the report. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State p
riority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with
 
alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requireme
nts for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

At Enchanted Hills, we believe in having a partnership with parents in order to support the educational progress of 
students. We encourage participation in school events, family activities, and in parent committees. Parents are members 
of our School Site C
ouncil and English Learner Advisory Committee and are stakeholders in the decision
-
making process. 
We invite parent volunteers in the classroom and are welcome to serve as chaperones on field trips. Many help with our 
annual carnival, which has proven to b
e a huge success. Parents assist the media center clerk with the book fairs in the 
fall and spring of each year.
 
 
All parents are welcome and are encouraged to participate in our many activities during the year such as our Math and 
Literacy family nights,

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Enchanted Hills Elementary is a model facility, reflecting that our highest priority is the safety and welfare of our student
s.   
All site staff, administrators, teachers, and supervision aides monitor the campus, to ensure a safe learning environment 
for 
our students.  The campus is a closed campus, with access only through the front office reception area; all guests, 
visitor, and vendors are required to check
-
in in the front office, where they are logged in through the Raptor System before 
gaining access 
to the campus.
 
 
Our school has an Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan that aligns with the NIMS Emergency System. The plan 
specifies procedures for dealing with fire, flood, earthquakes, lock downs, hazardous materials, disaster recovery 
organization,
 
and student accountability, following a disaster. These plans are updated and reviewed annually and 
throughout the year. In addition, we have state
-
of
-
the
-
art intrusion and fire alarm systems and we routinely conduct a 
variety of safety drills, to ensure 
that our students and staff are well prepared  to respond in the event of an emergency.  
In the event of a true emergency, our site utilizes the Illuminate Connect
-
Ed system to notify parents.
 
 
Video surveillance cameras across our campus are a deterrent t
o trespassers, vandalism, and other illegal activities. They 
also help administrators and local law enforcement with the investigation of any crimes that occur on campus after school 
hours, making our school safer and more secure.
