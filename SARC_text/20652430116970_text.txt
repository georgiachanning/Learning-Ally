O
n behalf of the staff at Parkwood Elementary School, I am 
delighted to welcome you to the 2019
-
2020 school year! We are looking forward to a productive partnership with you to ensure our 
children can achieve their highest potential.
 
 
Our goal is to ensure that all students become critical thinkers, active problem
-
solvers, inquisitive 
readers, diligent researchers and prolific writers. Teachers diligently work to refine their 
instructional strategies and identify best practices within Professional Learning Communities. 
Grade levels meet regularly to analyze student
 
progress and identify areas of focus. We do this to 
prepare students for the demands of the real
-
world so our students may become productive 
citizens, become our future leaders, and contribute and give back positive to the community.
 
 
Education is a joint
 
venture between school and home. As we work with our students to help them 
learn about the world around them through the prescribed curriculum, we very much appreciate 
the support that parents give their children at home as they strive to reach their lear
ning goals. The 
foundation of a successful school is the cooperation between the students, staff, parents and 
community.
 
 
I look forward to a great year! On behalf of the staff of Parkwood Elementary School, I want to 
thank you for being a part of our scho
ol community!
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Denise Muñoz
 
Principal, Parkwood Elementary School

Special Education Program: Parkwood is fully vested in the Center
-
Based Model of educating our special education students. These 
students are in the general education classroom for the majority of their day. They are provided support from a special educ
ation staff 
member during a portion of their time. They are also pulled out of the general education environment for more intense work as
 
is 
determined appropriate by the special education teacher and based on the needs determined in each special education
 

Individualized Education Plan (IEP). Parkwood has one full time special education teacher (Resource Specialist) and two full 
time and one 
part time special education aides to support our students.
 
 
English Learner Program: Teachers are trained t
o teach culturally diverse populations. English Language Development (ELD) is taught to 
our English learners for minimum of 45 minutes a day. Students are grouped by their language levels so that instruction can b
e targeted 
towards their specific areas of 
need. The emphasis is on oral language, listening, reading, writing, and thinking.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availa
bility of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Madera Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018, and determined that each school within the district had sufficien
t and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or sci
ence lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the
 
classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the s
tate are reviewed by all teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priorit

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Parkwood Elementary. The school is always in compliance with all law
s, rules, and regulations 
pertaining to hazardous materials and st
ate earthquake standards. The School Site Safety plan was last reviewed and updated by February 27, 2019 by 
the School Safety Committee and School Site Council. All revisions were communicated to both classified and certificated staf

r 
preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are conduc
ted on a monthly basis 
throughout the school year. Lockdown drills are held three times a year. Students are supervised before an
d after school by all staff members on a 
rotational schedule, and classified staff supervise students during lunch. There is a designated area for student drop off an
d pick up. Visitors will report 
to the office to obtain a visitors pass when on school pre

administrator with approval. Parents can become volunteers in the classroom by obtaining clearance through the Madera Unified

Staff members build 
teaching skills and concepts by participating in conferences and workshops throughout the year, then sharing their experience
s and 
knowledge with district colleagues. The Parkwood Professional Learning Community believes that learning must be guaranteed an
d viable. In order to 
assure this, focused targeted instruction and professional development occur at staff meetings weekly each month. Parkwood fa
cilitates cycles of 
inquiries where teachers develop formative assessments based on the Common Core State Sta
ndards, target instruction through calibrating strategies, 
provide feedback, and reteach to mastery.
