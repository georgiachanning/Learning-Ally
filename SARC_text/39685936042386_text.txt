School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Plan
ned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The District takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the Dis
trict 
uses the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) instrument developed by the State of 
California Office of Public School Construction. 
The results of this survey are available at the District Office. Below is more specific information on the condition of the 
school and the efforts made to ensure that students are provided with a clean, safe
, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School Buildings
 
The main campus was built in 1957, and an addition was built in 1958, and both were modernized in 1990 and again in 
2015. Portable classrooms were added in 1978, 1979, 1985, 1986, 1991, 1995, 
1996 (library), 1997, and a multi
-
purpose 
in 2003. The 2015/2016 modernization project included  a new administration/classroom building housing and eight new 
classrooms, the modernization of the permanent class building, conversion of existing administrat
ion to classroom space 
as well as the removal of several portable classrooms. At the completion of the modernization, the campus now includes 
29 permanent classrooms, 9 portable classrooms, a portable library, a multipurpose room and administration buildin
g.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep schools in good working order are completed in a timely 
manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and emergency repairs are given the highes
t priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 

is available at the school office and at the District Office. Staff works daily with the 
custodial staff to develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Program
 
The District allocates funding for deferred maintenance. The Deferred Maintenance Program includes funding for 
replacement of existing school bui
lding components so that the educational process may safely continue. Typically, this 

2019
-
2020 budget allocated $640,000 to addres
s deferred maintenance needs throughout the district.
 
 
Modernization Projects
 

y 
there are projects planned at Sequoia which were co
mpleted through the use of local funds. State funding applications 
for those portions of projects which may be eligible for modernization funding have been submitted. The modernization 
of the existing site was completed in 2017.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate 
Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement st
andards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the U
niversity of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
