School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School 
Profile:
 
Butte Valley Elementary School is the district's K
-
8 school. All K
-
8 students are located in the elementary school building 
in Dorris, California. The school is on the same campus as the Butte Valley High School. The students have their own gym, 
library, and playground area separate from the high school. The cafeteria is shared by all students, but lunches are 
staggered to minimize the number of students at one time, and to maintain separate lunch times for elementary and high 
school students. But
te Valley Elementary grades K
-
8 are divided into ten classrooms.  Grades K
-
8 operate as an elementary 
school with self
-
contained classrooms.
 
 
High school students are assets to the elementary school classrooms through the TA (Teacher's Assistant) program. 
The 
TA's help tutor and mentor students during class, make photocopies, and help the teachers in the classroom and on the 
playground.
 
 
A special day class for students in preschool through 12th grade is operated by the Siskiyou County Office of Education i
n 
a separate classroom. A resource teacher provides services to students with learning disabilities on site. A reading teacher 
provides reading intervention instruction to identified students.
 
 
District Mission: "All of us working together for the 
education of our students."

Quality, Currency, Availability of 
Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 2019
 
 
Butte Valley Unified held a Public Hearing on September 18, 2019, and determined that each school within the District 
has sufficient a
nd good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned 
textbooks or instruc
tional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home.  Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the State Department of Education, making the 
textbooks used in the school the most 
current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent ex
amination at the district office prior to adoption. 
The table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other 
instructional materials used at the school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement 
(Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate As
sessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement stan
dards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the Uni
versity of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Teachers participate in staff development and collaboration time weekly.   Teachers collaborate on various topics of 
specific interest or need. Staff members continue to build their teaching skills by participating in conferences and 
workshops throughout t
he year, then sharing their experiences and knowledge with district colleagues. The district also 
provides three full days to staff development annually. Over the past few years, our staff members have received training 
in the identification of essential s
tandards and development of pacing guides to improve instruction and Common Core 
standards. During the 2016
-
17 school year, the staff  received training in PBIS.  In the 2017
-
18 school year, the staff 
received Capturing Kids' Heart  and continued PBIS trai
ning.  Currently, we continue to train new staff in Capturing Kids' 
Hearts and PBIS.  Staff has been trained in ALICE techniques and strategies.
