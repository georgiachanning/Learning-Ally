School Description
 
Welcome to Azevada Elementary School! We are proud to be the home of the All Stars. We are also 
very proud to be the home of the only Mandarin Immersion program in the Fremont Unified School 
District. 
This School Accountability Report Card shares with the community our efforts to meet our 
district mission of ensuring that all students are college and career ready. Our goal is to provide 
each student with the essential skills to succeed in life as a kind
, considerate, and successful adult.
 
 
Azevada Elementary School is now primarily a kindergarten through 5th grade school. Beginning in 
the 2019
-
20 school year, 6th grade students attend Walters Middle School. However, our Mandarin 
Immersion program 
continues to serve kindergarten through 6th grade.
 
 
As you read this report, what will emerge is the picture of a diverse school community whose 
coordinated efforts are focused on the personal, academic, and social development of all our 
students. This inv
olves celebrating and enhancing our strengths, which include a competent, 
diverse, caring staff; a committed, involved parent community; a rigorous and stimulating 
curriculum; and energetic students who want to perform well. During the 2015
-
16 school year,
 
Azevada was named as a  California Gold Ribbon School. During the 2017
-
18 school year, Azevada 
received the California Distinguished School Award. We are very proud of both of these honors!
 
 
Our entire school site was modernized several years ago, and we 
believe we have one of the nicest 
facilities in the district. During the summer of 2015, a new building was erected on our school 
grounds which increased our school capacity by four new classrooms. All buildings have had seismic 
upgrades and are the safest
 
possible structures. We also have a large playground and lawn area, 
providing our students with an expansive and safe play area. We regularly overhear comments that 
we have one of the best facilities and playground areas in the district!
 
 
Mission Statemen
t:
 
At Azevada Elementary School, we help our students develop the skills necessary to succeed in a 
society that reaches far beyond the doors of our school and community. We challenge students to 
think deeply and apply critical thinking skills in their dail
y lives. We provide opportunities for them 
to achieve academically and socially in our diverse environment.
 
 
School Vision:
 
At Azevada Elementary School, we are developing a community of responsible students who 
respect cultural diversity and who are focus
ed on the achievement of high academic standards.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schoo
ls have enough books in core classes for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of 
Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Azevada Elementary was opened in 1965 with a new multipurpose building surrounded by 10 standard classrooms and an administra
tive office. In 1968, 
a new library/administrative office building and a second multi
-
use b
uilding, surrounded by 12 classrooms, were added. A school modernization project 
was completed in 2005. In 2014, two portable classrooms were added to the school environment due to an increase in student en
rollment, and in 
Summer 2015, a new building was e
rected on our school grounds which increased our school capacity by four additional classrooms.
 
 
Our goal is to provide safe and clean facilities that support the instructional program. We are fortunate to have a large ref
urbished blacktop area, a large 
la
wn area, a large lower grade play structure, and a new upper grade play structure (which was completed in Fall 2015). In addi
tion, we have a full stage 
in our multipurpose room, a separate cafeteria building, and an outdoor amphitheater with seating and a 
stage area. A large library and a computer lab 
are also available and actively used by all students and staff.
 
 
A garden/beautification committee that includes staff, students, and community members maintains and improves the school grou
nds with the 
assist
ance of district personnel.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Cons

Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report. Since that time, those
 
conditions may have changed.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school 
district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
One of our school's strategies for success is to provide many opportunities for our parents t
o become involved in the education of their students. Because 
we understand the importance of parent involvement, Azevada encourages parents to make a variety of contributions toward the 
overall well
-
being of 
their children. Parent involvement activities, 
which take place throughout the school year and in the evening, are offered to encourage parent 
involvement in their child's education. We also have a very involved PTA and Chinese Immersion parent group (CIPCF), and the 
members of each group 
provide much
-
appreciated support to our students, our school, and our classrooms. Parents are encouraged and invited to join our many pare
nt advisory 
groups including the School Site Council (SSC) and English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC). We also encourage parent
s and community members 
to become involved in the day
-
to
-
day functions and activities at our busy school. Please contact the school office to find out how you can become involved 
in the Azevada school community.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some 
time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach.  Below is the amoun
t of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
201
7
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations these days are sometimes reduced.
