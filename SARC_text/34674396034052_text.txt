School Description
 
 
The vision of John Cabrillo Elementary School is to provide a safe nurturing environment through a 
partnership with family and community where students develop academic excellence and social 
skills. Our students will become respectful, kind, responsible, l

Mission: To develop higher level thinking skills using technology and rigorous standards based

social skills and develop a caring community.
 
 
The staff at John Cabrillo understands that
 
each student comes to school with various strengths 
and areas of need.  As a result, we promote differentiated instruction through grade level team 
planning and classroom exchanges times to meet the individual learning needs of all students.

an RSP program for students with learning disabilities, an English Language Learner 
program, a computer lab, after school enrichment classes, Art instruction, tutoring, and The Center 
after school program.

ance of extracurricular activities in the academic 
achievement of the students.  Therefore, Cabrillo takes pride in providing the following lunchtime 
and after school programs:  book club, cheer club, dance club, athletic clubs, chess club, The Center,

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educatio
nal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, d
ata reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.c
a.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The district instructional material evaluation committee, consisted of members repres
enting teachers, administrators, other staff, students, 
parents/guardians, and community, ensures that the selected textbooks, technology
-
based materials and other educational materials effectively support 
the district's adopted courses of study and meet c
urrent curricular goals and California Content Standards. Teachers, students, parents/guardians and 
community members have the opportunity to review and provide input about the instructional materials being considered for ado
ption. 
Recommendations for the 
adoption and/or withdrawal of instructional materials by the instructional material evaluation committee are presented to 
the Board by the Superintendent or designee and include documentation supporting the recommendation. In some instances, the c
onsidered
 
textbooks 
and/or instructional materials are piloted for a period of time before being recommended for adoption to the Board of Educati
on.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators 
and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including ELA 
Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, 
Culturally and Linguistically Relevant Teaching and Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through this program deeply align with the needs of our ind
ividual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accounta
bility Plan, and connect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson design.

their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of responsibility.
