By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our Vision:
 
In partnership with our families and community, we are creating a culture of 21st Century Learning engaging our students 
in college and career readiness, where everyone is a learn
er, everyone is a teacher, and everyone is a leader!
 
 
Our Mission:
 
 
The mission of Serrano Elementary School is to become a high performing community school that engages all students in 
exemplary teaching and learning experiences that are rigorous, differe
ntiated, meaningful and take place in a safe and 
orderly environment! Scholars will be well equipped to impact, influence and contribute to a global society, with the 
freedom to explore and develop their strengths!
 
 
We will prepare our students for college
 
and career readiness, which includes 21st Century Learning and increased 
academic achievements for ALL students. Through our collaborative professional learning opportunities we will develop 
instructional strategies via data collected from formative and s
ummative assessments, provide strategic intervention 
opportunities to identified students, utilize interim assessments to measure growth and provide practice, progress 
monitor to ensure individual growth and use additional strategies via Serrano Multi
-
Tier
ed Systems of Support and CAST.
 
 
 
ELA
-
 
Identified  SBAC claims Speaking and Listening. We will deconstruct the standards and ens
ure specific speaking and 
listening opportunities are offered in the classroom every day. Teachers will emphasize focused, targeted reading 
instruction strategies daily. We will use the Reading Counts SRI scores to monitor and measure student growth. And, 
we 
will schedule SBAC Interim Assessments.
 
 
Math 
-
 
Identified SBAC claims Concepts and Procedures. We will deconstruct the standards and align instructional 
strategies for SBAC readiness. Students will be able to use appropriate tools and 
strategies to think critically, solve 
problems and will be able to support mathematical conclusions. We will schedule SBAC and use Interim Assessments and 
analyze SBAC data to inform instruction.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Maintaining the appearance, safety and functionality of 
Serrano School is important.  Serrano Elementary School was built 
in 1964.  The custodial staff takes great pride in their work and support is provided by district staff and outside contracto
rs 
responding to work orders generated by school staff.  In 2002,
 
special emphasis was placed on building a new lunch area, 
providing new playground equipment, and an outdoor seating area for school assemblies and performance.
 
 
A district site inspection of Serrano evaluates the condition of school site 
facilities and determined that Serrano's facilities 
achieved a "Good" ranking.The information in the following table is taken from the latest school site inspection. Work 
orders have been created for all items noted as fair with our custodial staff and/or 
district maintenance department.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Teachers are trained in district procedures regarding student safety. Maintaining the safety and functionality of Serrano 
Elementary is of utmost importance. Classr
oom doors are kept locked during the day, and each room is equipped with a 
"Lock Blok" device in order to make lock

down situations more safe for teachers. A comprehensive safety and disaster 
plan is in effect and practiced twice a year. Fire and/or earthq
uake drills are conducted monthly. Serrano's PTA purchased 
equipment and supplies for every classroom for emergency use.
 
Each classroom is equipped with a two
