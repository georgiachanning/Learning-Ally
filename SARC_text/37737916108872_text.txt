Description
 
Paloma
 
opened
 
its
 
doors
 
in
 
1990.
 
The
 
school
 
currently
 
has
 
44
 
classrooms
 
(including
 
26
 
relocatables)
 
a
 
multipurpose
 
room,
 
a
 
library,
 
and
 
an
 
administration
 
building
 
that
 
are
 
networked
 
for
 
Internet
 
access
 
throughout
 
the
 
school.
 
We
 
are
 
fortunate
 
to
 
be
 
located
 
next
 
to
 
a
 
park
 
that
 
is
 
frequently
 
used
 
for
 
school
 
events.
  
Student-made
 
tile
 
walls
 
and
 
murals
 
decorate
 
our
 
school,
  
and
 
our
 
professional
 
custodial
 
staff
 
takes
 
great
 
pride
 
in
 
maintaining
 
the
 
facility
 
for
 
students
 
and
 
staff.
 
We
 
have
 
3
 
shade
 
structures-
 
in
 
the
 
lunch
 
area,
 
the
 
snack
 
area,
 
and
 
adjacent
 
to
 
the
 
grass
 
field.
  
We
 
have
 
two
 
new
 
sensory
 
rooms
 
adjacent
 
to
 
our
 
new
 
Moderate/Significant
 
classrooms.
 
 
Our
 
goal
 
is
 
that
 
all
 
students
 
will
 
continue
 
to
 
meaningfully
 
increase
 
their
 
academic
 
knowledge
 
in
 
reading,
 
writing,
 
math,
 
science,
 
and
 
social
 
studies.
 
Education
 
is
 
very
 
important
 
to
 
the
 
future
 
of
 
our
 
students,
 
and
 
at
 
Paloma
 
we
 
will
 
continue
 
to
 
strive
 
to
 
help
 
them
 
become
 
active,
 
inquiring,
 
life-long
 
learners
 
who
 
will
 
be
 
prepared
 
for
 
college
 
and
 
career,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
for
 
global
 
citizenship.
 
Our
 
teachers
 
employ
 
best
 
instructional
 
practices
 
which
 
include
 
differentiated
 
instruction
 
at
 
all
 
academic
 
levels.
 
At
 
Paloma:
 
students
 
demonstrate
 
respect
 
and
 
responsibility
 
while
 
putting
 
forth
 
their
 
best
 
effort
 
toward
 
their
 
educational
 
learning
 
experience;
 
teachers
 
and
 
staff
 
set
 
and
 
implement
 
standards-
based
 
learning
 
goals
 
and
 
monitor
 
results
 
to
 
differentiate
 
instruction
 
to
 
meet
 
the
 
individual
 
needs
 
of
 
learners;
 
and
 
parents
 
partner
 
with
 
the
 
school
 
to
 
enhance
 
their
 
child™s
 
academic
 
growth
 
and
 
strength
 
of
 
character.
 
 
 
Paloma
 
Elementary
 
strives
 
to
 
create
 
an
 
environment
 
in
 
which
 
all
 
children
 
have
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
achieve
 
academic
 
excellence.
 
We,
 
the
 
members
 
of
 
the
 
Paloma
 
Elementary
 
Community,
 
are
 
dedicated
 
to
 
ensuring
 
that
 
all
 
Paloma
 
Panthers
 
have
 
equal
 
access
 
to
 
learn
 
and
 
grow
 
in
 
a
 
collaborative,
 
safe
 
and
 
positive
 
environment.
  
Students
 
will
 
develop
 
a
 
love
 
of
 
learning
 
and
 
acquire
 
lifelong
 
skills
 
to
 
become
 
engaged,
 
responsible,
 
and
 
independent
 
members
 
of
 
society.
 
 
 
About
 
the
 
SARC
 
By
 
February
 
1
 
of
 
each
 
year,
 
every
 
school
 
in
 
California
 
is
 
required
 
by
 
state
 
law
 
to
 
publish
 
a
 
School
 
Accountability
 
Report
 
Card
 
(SARC).
 
The
 
SARC
 
contains
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
condition
 
and
 
performance
 
of
 
each
 
California
 
public
 
school.
 
Under
 
the
 
Local
 
Control
 
Funding
 
Formula
 
(LCFF)
 
all
 
local
 
educational
 
agencies
 
(LEAs)
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
prepare
 
a
 
Local
 
Control
 
and
 
Accountability
 
Plan
 
(LCAP),
 
which
 
describes
 
how
 
they
 
intend
 
to
 
meet
 
annual
 
school-specific
 
goals
 
for
 
all
 
pupils,
 
with
 
specific
 
activities
 
to
 
address
 
state
 
and
 
local
 
priorities.
 
Additionally,
 
data
 
reported
 
in
 
an
 
LCAP
 
is
 
to
 
be
 
consistent
 
with
 
data
 
reported
 
in
 
the
 
SARC.

that
 
are
 
networked
 
for
 
Internet
 
access
 
throughout
 
the

We
 
are
 
fortunate
 
to
 
be
 
located
 
next
 
to
 
a
 
park
 
that
 
is
 
frequently
 
used
 
for
 
school
 
events.
 
A
 
student-made
 
tile
 
wall
 
decorates
 
the
 
front
 
of
 
our
 
school,
 
and
 
a
 
professional
 
custodial
 
staff
 
takes
 
great
 
pride
 
in
 
maintaining
 
the
 
facility
 
for
 
students
 
and
 
staff.
 
We
 
have
 
3
 
shade
 
structures-
 
in
 
the
 
lunch
 
area
 
and
 
snack
 
area
 
by
 
the
 
playground.
 
We
 
have
 
two
 
new
 
sensory
 
rooms
 
adjacent
 
to
 
our
 
new
 
Moderate/Significant
 
classrooms.
 
The
 
physical
 
quality
 
of
 
our
 
school
 
building
 
influences
 
learning
 
and
 
teaching.
 
All
 
students
 
and
 
faculty
 
need
 
a
 
reasonable
 
amount
 
of
 
classroom
 
and
 
open
 
space.
 
We
 
strive
 
to
 
maintain
 
and
 
improve
 
the
 
facilities
 
and
 
land.
 
 
Cleaning

The
 
district
 
governing

has
 
adopted
 
cleaning

these

is
 
available
 
at
 
the
 
school

and
 
at
 
the

The
 
principal
 
works
 
daily
 
with
 
the
 
custodial
 
staff
 
to
 
develop
 
cleaning
 
schedules
 
to
 
ensure
 
a
 
clean
