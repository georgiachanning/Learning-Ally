By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Rivera Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff and 
volunteers. The School Safety Plan is 
revised and updated annually and reviewed with administrators, staff, and School Site Council members. The School Safety 
Plan is designed to assist in preparing for emergencies, managing emergency response efforts, and
 
maintaining a safe 
school environment. The plan requires identification of security needs, development of prevention and intervention 
techniques, evaluation of facilities, and communication with staff and students. Components of the School Safety Plan 
inc
lude strategies and programs that will provide and maintain a high level of school safety, assess current school crime 
occurring on campus and at school functions, and address procedures related to the compliance of existing laws as they 
affect school safe
ty. Safety of students and staff is a primary concern at Rivera Elementary School. The school complies 
with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The school's 
disaster preparedness plan includes 
steps for ensuring student body and staff safety during an emergency. Fire drills are 
held monthly, while other disaster drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year. Teachers and other 
staff members monitor the school grounds before,
 
during, and after school each day. All visitors are required to check in 
at the office before entering the campus. The initial plan will be finalized by the Spring of 2016. The school safety plan wa
s 
reviewed, updated, and discussed with school faculty an
d a student representative on October 30, 2019.
