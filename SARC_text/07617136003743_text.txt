Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Happy Valley 
invites each and every parent to volunteer whether it is for one job or many, for ten minutes or for several 
hours. Any time you can give will benefit our children. Parents volunteer in classrooms, help with special programs, work 
with individuals or small
 
groups, do clerical work, check books out of the library, run hot lunch lines, work on fundraising 
committees, and help with a wide variety of other support work needed around campus. Our supportive parent 
community allows for great school traditions and 
annual events such as our Back to School Picnic, Fall Carnival, Book Fair, 
Science Fair, Art Fair and Spring Picnic as well as our end of the year Run/Walkathon.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Happy Valley Emergency Preparedness Plan is kept on file in the school office. Plans and procedures were reviewed 
prior to the start of school and then 
reviewed again with staff periodically at staff meetings throughout the school year. 
Each staff member received information about procedures, Staff Priority Release List, and evacuation routes. These routes 
are posted in all rooms. Some modifications, rela
ted to drills for fire and earthquake, were implemented at this time. All 
students and staff participate in several drills for fire, as well as earthquake drills throughout the year. We also particip
ate 

 
supply backpacks kept in each classroom have been recently updated 
as well as the emergency supplies kept in our emergency preparedness shed in the event that we are staying on campus 
for a longer period of time. There is an emergency preparedness staff c
ommittee and members have attended a variety 
of professional development training including shooter on
-
campus training run by the local fire and police departments.

are focused on improving student achievement and deepening and strengthening teacher practice. Professional 
development also occurs at all sites in a variety of ways. 
Professional Learning Communities, book groups, peer coaching,
