By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

In 2011, the Governor and State Legislature extended the suspension of State Board of Education (SBE) adoptions of 
instructional materials until the 2015

16 school year (Education Co
de Section 60200.7).  At this time the State has adopted 
frameworks for English Language Arts/ English Language Development, and math which will assist in our implementation 
of  California's Common Core State Standards. We are currently piloting  State Boa
rd of Education adopted (January, 2014) 
instructional materials for math to reflect the rigor of the California's Common Core State Standards, teachers are 
developing curricula units, and various resources are provided as additional instructional materials
. The State Board of 
Education adopted ELA/ ELD instructional materials in November 2015  which directed our pilot and adoption of new 
instructional materials.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Centralia School 
District welcomes and values parental and family involvement in District and school programs. During 
the 2019
-
20 school year, CESD continued the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) process. This funding process 
requires school districts to engage pare
nts, teachers, employee groups, and the wider community to be a part of the 
development of the LCAP. Informational meetings were held with various stakeholders including: members of the 
Governing Board, parents, PTAs, and advisory groups (DELAC, GATE, PTA)
. The LCAP Committee includes representatives 
from each stakeholder group. The culmination of the LCAP Committee was the adoption of the 2019
-
20 LCAP by the Board 
of Trustees on June 19, 2019. The LCAP represents an opportunity to further strengthen the co
mmitments between our 
District and our community on behalf all of students. 
 
 
George B. Miller Elementary School is proud of its active and involved parent community. Parents/ guardians are invited 
to take an engaged role at the school. There are four diff
erent groups with regularly scheduled opportunities for parents 
to provide leadership. The School Site Council (SSC) focuses on the annual school goals and is responsible for the 
School 
Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA), as well as final approval for the
 
School Safe Plan; the English Learner Advisory 
Committee (ELAC) offers input for parents and families of students who are learning English; the Safety Team gives parents 
an opportunity to help design and implement our safety plan; and the Parent Teacher A
ssociation (PTA) coordinates 
activities in support of the school programs, and provides support for all students. In addition, we have community 
members who volunteers hundreds of hours in the classroom working with students, attending field trips, donatin
g their 
time during a school event, and preparing materials.
 
 
The school website provides information regarding all aspects of parent involvement. On the calendar parents can find all 
school events and activities. Teachers keep in contact with parents via 
email and classroom appls such as Class Dojo and 
SeeSaw. A Sunday Night Message (SNM) goes home weekly via School Messenger, and is also posted on the website's 
homepage as a Weekly Announcement. These messages are sent home in English and Korean. The scho
ol's Twitter page 
is also updated regularly to keep parents and families updated on all school activities. Additionally, families know of 
upcoming events via the school's marquee, and can read about the school's achievements in the quarterly publication, 
S
chool News.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of George B. Miller Elementary. The Safe School Action Plan was 
developed by the Site Safety Committee and the School Site Council with input from the School Safety Team. The Safe 
School Action Plan is revi
ewed and revised annually by all stakeholders. New goals and tasks are added as necessary. The 
2019
-
20 goals of our Safe School Action Plan include the following goals:
 
 
COMPONENT ONE: PEOPLE AND PROGRAMS
 

 
respect, tolerance and pride for diversity of culture, ethnicity, and 
philosophy. It is a place where students demonstrate strong academic progress, follow school rules, and develop 
responsibility for their learning and respect for themselves and their sc
hool.
 
 

 
 
COMPONENT TWO: PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
 
Goal
 
1: G. B. Miller School provides a secure campus with careful monitoring and supervision of all areas to ensure student 
safety and adherence to rules.
 
 
Goal 2: G. B. Miller School provides for the safety of students and staff through a well
-
planned and imp
lemented crisis 
response plan.
 
 
Centralia School District has developed a Disaster Plan for emergencies.  Staff members receive professional development 
and are assigned responsibilities for plan implementation.  The school and District participate in the 
annual California 
Shake Out earthquake drill each October.   Fire evacuation and other emergency drills are held monthly.  The school 
maintains a Safety Committee and it meets at least four times a year to review safety issues, plan staff development, and 
makes recommendations for improvement.
 
 
The plan provides students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes 
the following requirements of SB 187 within their safe school plans: current status of school cri
me; child abuse reporting 
procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsion; notification to 
teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, pa
rents, and 
school employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.  Annually, the school evaluates 
and updates the plan. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Plan, are reviewed with school and District 
st
aff in the fall, at the start of each school year.
 
 
G. B. Miller School knows that ensuring a positive learning experience requires a safe and respectful environment.  Toward 
this end, G. B. Miller implements a school
-
wide Positive Behavior and Interventio
n Supports (PBIS) system that 
communicates high expectations for student behavior. Each student receives training on behavior expectations. At the 
beginning of the school year students are taught the "R.A.C.E." attributes (Be RESPECTFUL and ACHIEVE, be CON
SIDERATE 
and EXCEL).  Teachers teach, monitor, reinforce, and exhibit these attributes throughout the year. All students and staff 
are expected to be role models for each other. The school has earned a Platinum medal (highest level) from the State of 
Calif
ornia PBIS coalition for the past three years for their PBIS program implementation. The school follows all District 
Board Policies including those pertaining to Safety, Suspension, Expulsion and Mandatory Expulsion and Sexual 
Harassment.
 
 
The Centralia Sc
hool District's Board of Trustees reviews the safety plans annually by March 1st.
