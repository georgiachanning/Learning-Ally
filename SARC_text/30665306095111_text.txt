School Description
 
Moffett School is a K
-
5 school nestled within a quiet, residential neighborhood comprised mostly 
of single family homes. Located in the southwest section of Huntington Beach, California, Moffett 
School is a modern 
facility, built in 1975 and modernized in 2005 to meet the growing demands for 
technology integration as part of the instructional learning process. We are, again, undergoing a 
modernization process to create classrooms that will meet the needs of 21st Cen
tury learners. The 
culture within our walls retains the values and traditions that have been lauded throughout history. 
A sense of belonging and pride can be felt throughout the school. Monday mornings find the 
Moffett community gathered together to honor 
our country's flag, to share pertinent school and 
safety information, and to celebrate the accomplishments of students, teachers, parents, and staff.
 
 
Operating on a traditional schedule, Moffett School serves a population of 575 students. At the 
time of t
his writing, 17 students were identified English Language Learners, 76 students received 
special education services, and 39 students were identified GATE.
 
 
Moffett School is a Learning Community 
--
 
a community where learning is valued and everyone is 
engag
ed in the process. The Moffett School staff is committed to all students succeeding in a 
rigorous core curriculum. A collaboratively developed mission statement clearly defines the 
purpose of our learning community. We believe our purpose is:
 

 
To provide st
udents a solid foundation in literacy, mathematics, science, and history;
 

 
To help children respect and value themselves and others;
 

 
To teach children to access and apply information;
 

 
To teach children to be effective communicators (to read, to write, to sp
eak and to 
listen well);
 

 
To develop critical thinking and problem
-
solving skills; and
 

 
To provide a safe, secure and supportive learning environment.
 
 
The above statement is the foundation that guides our decisions and determines our actions as we 
work toget
her to provide our children a strong foundation for the future.
 
 
Rigorous Common Core Standards further define our purpose and clarify student outcomes and 
expectations. The Moffett School staff believes that reading is the foundation for all learning. It 
is 
essential that every student leave third grade reading to learn. Common Core Standards and 
specific learning objectives determine what is taught, and it is expected that all students will meet 
or exceed these standards. Teachers meet regularly in grade 
level teams to analyze student 
performance data and to plan research
-
based instruction and support. Three elements define the 
foundation for results at Moffett School: teamwork; clear, measurable goals; and the ongoing 
analysis of performance data.

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the 
school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents and community are very supportive of the educational programs at Moffett School. The Moffett School Parent Teacher As
sociation (PTA) and 
the Assistan
ce League of Huntington Beach (ALHB) have made generous contributions of time and money to numerous programs and activities. 
PTA 
fundraisers enable the school to offer programs in art, music, and reading.  They also enrich classroom learning experiences 
th
rough donations that 
support assemblies, field trips, and the purchase of support materials relating to instruction.
 
 
The Moffett School PTA directly supports a variety of instructional programs by providing funding and volunteer hours, includ
ing Best Foot
 
Forward, a 
reading incentive program; after
-
school enrichment programs; Art Masters; and our grade level field trips.
 
 
The Moffett School Site Council is a leadership body consisting of staff and parents. Interested parents can submit their nam
e in the fa
ll and participate 
in an election for representation on the council. The council gathers input for use in the decision making process regarding 
the expenditure of site funds 
in alignment with the implementation of our school plan.
 
 
Parent participation in 
Moffett classrooms is critical to the success of our school. Teachers design their lessons knowing parents will assist in the
 
classroom 
to allow for small group and individualized instruction from kindergarten through fifth grade. Additionally, Moffett par
ents support the implementation 
of our homework program by establishing an environment in which the homework can be completed, monitoring their child's effor
ts, and reviewing 
homework for accuracy and completion.
 
 
State Priority: School Clima
te
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive Safe Sch
ool Plan was developed by the district to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The plan provides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 within
 
their
 
safe school plans: 
current status and assessment of school crime; identification of strategies and programs that provide and maintain a high lev
el of school safety; child 
abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies rel
ated to suspension and expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual 
harassment and discrimination policy; policies and procedures for the prevention of bullying; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and 
egress of pupils, parents, and school e
mployees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and makes any modifications as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Sa
fe School Plan, were 
reviewed with school and dist
rict staff at the beginning of the 2019
-
20 school year. The plan was reviewed and updated with staff and School Site Council 
in early 2020.
 
 
Moffett School enlists the support of staff to participate on our School Safety Committee.  We annually update our 
Disaster Plan including assignments, 
roles, and responsibilities in regard to disaster preparation and planning.  Staff are updated at staff meetings.  As well, s
taff (both certificated and 
classified) are trained in our Moffett "Run, Hide, Fight" as well 
as active shooter training.  Training includes how to manage/participate in a lock down 
and shelter in place.  Students participate in monthly fire/earthquake drills as well as evacuation drills for a dangerous in
dividual on campus.
 
 
The district progressi
vely addresses structural needs at each school to ensure facilities are safe and comply with education codes as well as build
ing and 
safety regulations. One automated external defibrillator (AED) was installed in the administration building. A $169 million
 
bond (Measure Q) approved 
in November 2016 provides the necessary funding for District

Staff development at Moffett School is guided by three questions: What are all students expected to know and be able to do? W
hat must 
teachers know 
and do in order to ensure student success? Where must we focus our staff development efforts to meet both goals? High quality
 
staff development is 
essential to creating schools in which all students and staff members are learners who continua
lly improve their performance. At the beginning of each 
school year, we analyze school
-
wide and grade level student performance assessment data to set goals and develop action plans that include staff 
development. Planning day schedule, every Thursday, fac
ilitates grade level Professional Learning Community (PLC) meetings and whole staff 
collaboration. Staff meetings are important forums for staff development. Frequently, coaches and consultants meet with teach
ers to share information 
pertinent to our conti
nued growth.  As well, education research and online programming are reviewed and discussed with teachers for use in supporti

students and our instructional program. In teams, individually, and in collaboration with the principal during the instructio
nal
 
supervision process, 
teachers reference the California Standards for the Teaching Profession as a tool to reflect upon their own performance and t
o identify areas for individual 
and collective growth. During the instructional supervision process, the prin
cipal facilitates conversations that include opportunities for reflection and 
inquiry through open
-
ended questioning.
 
 
Teachers regularly engage in dialogue about best practice and research
-
based instruction during grade level PLC and full staff meetings. 
Professional 
publications and memberships in such organizations as the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development and the Inte
rnational Reading 
Association are purchased and shared with staff. The Principal's Bookshelf and the Professional Book
shelf in the library provide a wide array of reading 
and viewing materials.  As well, teachers reference professional associations and sites such as Illuminate, Smarter Balanced,
 
etc. to support the design 
and implementation of their instructional program.
 
 
At Moffett School, technology is intricately integrated in the teaching
-
learning process to help students develop skills and foster understanding.  Teacher 
leaders provide on
-
going support, coaching, and training for their colleagues. Continuous and sust
ainable school improvement requires three ingredients: 
a shared language, an empowered leadership group, and time. Our Professional Learning Community structure provides a framewor
k for continuous and 
sustainable school improvement. The essential elements 
of a PLC include: clarity of purpose, precision in the use of concepts and language, learning 
through doing as part of the teacher's daily work, interdependent action through teamwork, and a results
-
orientation that focuses on the learning of 
every student
. Teachers at Moffett School understand the elements of a PLC, function within the PLC framework, and utilize this structure 
to create a 
consistency across the grade.  As well, grade level teams utilize the PLC process to support student learning through i
ntervention as deemed necessary 
through data analysis.  Students receive individual and small group instructional support to ensure that all students are abl
e to access and be successful 
with their learning. Teachers also collaborate on a weekly/bi
-
weekly 
basis during our PLC time. Teachers evaluate data, instruction, assessments, and 
curriculum. They also design and plan for intervention and intervention grouping, as noted above.  Teachers collaborate at gr
ade level meetings to discuss 
student learning, in
structional strategies, and  school business. The Moffett Instructional Leadership Team meets to discuss and plan for the bes
t learning 
program and environment for our school.  This information is then disseminated to the staff through grade level teams.
 
 
Through support of the District Office, coaching for Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), Number Talks, and Language Arts Pr
ogramming is provided.  
Moffett staff also received training in the use of Accelerated Reader (AR) and the STAR component of AR for
 
use as a tool to monitor student progress.  
Staff continue to receive professional development through our staff trainers throughout the school year. It is a goal of our
 
school to develop teachers 
as leaders.  As such, we utilize the strengths of staff me
mbers to support our instructional program implementation.  Staff coaches serve as leaders for 
our school to ensure the successful implementation and maintenance of the our instructional and support programming.  We are 
conscious of the need 
for an on
-
goin
g review of core "Moffett Must
-
Haves" programming.  As such, these teacher leaders provide review training and initial training for new 
staff.  This allows for the most consistency in the programs we believe best support our students and their learning.
 
 
M
offett continues the use of the MIND Research Institute's "ST Math" program to support student attainment of conceptual under
standing in 
mathematics.  As well, the fluency component provides students the adaptive training and continuous assessment needed t
o ensure the proper practice 
to develop fluency with basic math facts.  Teachers have received training and are pulling from ST Math lessons for integrati
on in CGI and Number Talk 
lessons.  This combination provides synthesis in math instruction and suppor
ts Common Core teaching and learning.  As well, to support a well
-
rounded, 
brain
-
based learning system, Moffett has also implemented the ST Math Music Keyboarding Program to make a complete learning cycle f
or students in 
regard to the ST Math/Music Program
.
