I
 
would like to welcome you to Vista del Valle Elementary School's annual School Accountability

requirements, every school in California is required to issue an annual School Accountability Report 
Card.  Parents and community members will find valuable information about our academic 
achievement, professional staff, curricular programs, instructional 
materials, safety procedures, 
classroom environment, and condition of facilities.
 
 
Vista del Valle Elementary School provides a warm, stimulating environment where students are 
actively involved in learning academics as well as positive values. Students re
ceive a standards

based, challenging curriculum by dedicated professional staff, based on the individual needs of the 
students. Ongoing evaluation of student progress and achievement helps us refine the instructional 
program so students can achieve academi
c proficiency.
 
 
We have made a commitment to provide the best educational program possible for Vista del Valle 
Elementary School's students, and welcome any suggestions or questions you may have about the

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of 
each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formul
a (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local 
priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, pare
nts/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency,
 
Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Vista del Valle Elementary School are currently being aligned to the California 
State Standards. Instructional 
materials are selected 
from the state's most recent list of standards
-
based materials and adopted by the State Board of Education. The district follows 
the State Board of Education's adoption cycle for core content materials (English language arts, math, science, and social sc
ie
nce).
 
 
On Thursday, October 17, 2019, the Claremont Unified School District's Board of Education held a public hearing to certify th
e extent to which textbooks 
and instructional materials have been provided to students. The Board of Education adopted Resol
ution #06
-
2020 which certifies as required by Education 
Code ยง60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional materials were provided to all students, including English learners, in the 
district to the extent that each 
pupil has a textbook or instructional mate
rials, or both, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials were 
provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with 
the cycles and cont
ent of 
the curriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English language arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materia
ls used for their visual/per
forming 
arts curricula. During the 2018
-
19 school year, Claremont Unified School District provided each student, including English learners, enrolled in a 
visual/performing arts class with a textbook or instructional materials to use in class and to take h
ome. These materials complied with the state's content 
standards and curriculum frameworks.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional through proper facilities 
maintenance and campus supervision. 
Vista del Valle Elementary School's original facilities were built in 1953; ongoing maintenance and campus improvements ensur
e facilities remain up to 
date and provide adequate space for students and staff. District main
tenance and site custodial staff ensure that the repairs necessary to keep the school 
in good condition are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used by school and district staff to communicate 
non
-
routine maintenance 
requests. Emergency r
epairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Every morning before school begins, the custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards or other conditions that need attent
ion prior to students and staff 
entering school grounds. One day custodian and one evening 
custodian are assigned to Vista del Valle Elementary School. The day custodian is responsible 
for:
 

 
General grounds maintenance
 

 
Lunch area setup/cleanup
 

 
Restroom cleaning
 

 
Trash removal
 
 
 
Restrooms are checked throughout the day for cleanliness and subsequen
tly cleaned as needed. The evening custodian is responsible for:
 

 
Classroom cleaning
 

 
Common use area cleaning
 

 
Multipurpose room cleaning
 

 
Restroom cleaning
 
 
 
The principal communicates with custodial staff daily concerning maintenance and school safety issue

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priorit

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical
