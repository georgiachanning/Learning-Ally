Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Jacoby Creek School is proud of the safe and clean
 
environment we provide for our students. Our facilities are maintained 
by two full
-
 
time maintenance employee and two custodians. During the 2005
-
 
2006 school year our site received a million 
dollar grant from the state to perform a facilities upgrade con
sisting of new windows, siding, roofing, technology 
infrastructure and phone system. In 2010 we completed construction of 3 new energy
-
efficient classrooms for our 7th 
and 8th grade students. Additionally, five classrooms, the staff work room and the staff
 
lounge were all modernized within 
the recent past. A fairly new play field with recreation equipment provided a very enjoyable play environment for our 
students. We have nearly completed our California Clean Energy Jobs Act projects. These projects which 
have greatly 
increased our energy efficiency. Our district recently passed at 2.6 million dollar facilities bond which will be used to rep
air 
and improve our school's facilities and ADA compliance updates, painting, and other exciting facilities projects w
ere 
completed during the summer of 2019.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Jacoby Creek School has policies and plans in place to assure the safety of our students. Our comprehensive school safety 
plan was 
updated in 2019 and covers the details of all emergency responses. Each month we practice one emergency 
situation. We strive to ensure effective communication by equipping all classrooms with telephones and access to the 
Internet. Our office maintains a we
ather radio alert as well as a CB to cover emergency situations. Visitors are required to 
register in the school office and display a guest badge during their visit. Additionally, all staff has been trained in first
 
aid, 
CPR and threat assessment. Student 
comfort and safety is a very high priority.
