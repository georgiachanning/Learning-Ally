School Description
 
Meadow Heights Elementary 
School is a public school for grades Transitional Kindergarten to fifth 
grade with a student body of approximately 300. Founded in 1950, the school is located on a 
beautiful suburban campus in San Mateo, California. Meadow Heights Elementary School is 
comm
itted to meeting the needs of all students in a stimulating, safe, caring environment through 
a challenging, comprehensive instructional program. It is the school's goal to empower students 
with a feeling of joy in lifelong learning by encouraging individu
al leadership, cooperative 
interaction, intellectual risk
-
taking, and a respect for oneself and others. It is the school's 
responsibility, in conjunction with the home and community, to encourage and help each child 
acquire the knowledge, skills, abilities
 
and desire to live effectively and responsibly in an ever
-
changing society. Meadow Heights mission is to create a learning environment which will provide 
basic skills and will motivate the child to reach his/her highest academic potential. We believe our 
school should nurture in the child a sense of personal worth, love of learning, creativity, a critical 
spirit, productive citizenship and appreciation of human differences.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to pu
blish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepa
re a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consiste
nt with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information 
about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school 
principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The San Mateo
-
Foster City School District makes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe and functional. To assist in these
 
efforts, the 
District has developed and the Board of Trustees
 
has approved, a District
-
wide Facilities Implementation Master Plan in order to bring each school site 
up to district facility standards for educational excellence. To support that effort, in 2008 the community passed a $175 mil
lion facilities bond to rep
air, 
renovate, upgrade and increase capacity at District schools. Bond funding has been used to upgrade facilities over the past 1
0 years. A lunch shade 
structure and age
-
appropriate play structures were added to the campus, student classroom furniture was
 
replaced, exterior painting was completed 
and perimeter fencing was installed for school security.
 
 
In 2015, the community once again passed a $142 million bond (Measure X). Phase I is well underway, adding classrooms and a g
ym at Abbott and Borel 
and a g
ym at Bayside Academy, in addition to a new fourth elementary school in Foster City.
 
 
With the passing of the State Facilities Bond in November 2016, the District will seek any State Modernization matching funds
 
on a percentage basis to 
assist with the exp
enditures for any major planned modernization work projects.
 
 
The District's Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are c
ompleted in a timely manner, 
while the Operations staff ensures that 
the schools are kept clean. A work order process through a program called "Akita Box" is used to ensure efficient 
service; emergency repairs are given the highest priority. In addition to responding to emergency repairs in a timely manner,
 
the maintenance 
department 

 
 
Most District schools are staffed with at least one day and one night custodian to provide a clean and hazard
-
free environment. Some of the larger 
sc
hools, particularly the middle schools, are staffed with one day custodian and two or three night custodians. The Principal, 
along with the maintenance 
staff, work with the custodians to develop cleaning schedules to ensure clean and safe schools. The cust

which are available at the District Office. In addition, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the Stat
e of California's Office of Public 
School Construction to evaluate the condi
tions of each schools facility. This evaluation is completed annually for each site. The following school site

creating a safe and caring school community where all students and families feel welcomed, valued and respected. These Guidin
g Princip
les (respect, 
responsibility, appreciation of differences, honesty, safety and life
-
long learning) communicate the expectations for behavior to students, parents, 
teachers and administrators and are updated and reviewed yearly. The rules were developed to 
be consistent with State Education Code, policies of the 
San Mateo
-
Foster City School District Board of Trustees and the School District's Strategic Plan.
 
 
Comprehensive School Safety Plans, developed individually for each school in conjunction with the 
San Mateo County Office of Education and City 
Services, include disaster preparedness and emergency procedures. The School Safety Plans provide role responsibility guideli
nes and processes required 
to address major emergencies. Annually, the District utili

determine if all required components are included and to offer feedback and suggestions.
 
 
California Education Code Section 32280 requires school fire evacuation dr
ills, as well as one law enforcement lockdown drill, and the District organizes 
two District
-
wide drills each year, using different scenarios that test the Big Five Safety Protocols (Shelter in Place, Secure Campus, Dr
op, Cover and Hold 
On, Lockdown/Barric
ade and Evacuation). These drills involve a District Command Center for communication with each school/program site and full 
emergency set

up. As a District collaborating with San Mateo County and the San Mateo County Office of Education, we participate ye
arly in Big Five 
training for staff.

The San 
Mateo
-
Foster City School District is committed to providing quality professional development opportunities for all staff. Training 
is available 
through three professional development days, staff meetings, scheduled release times during the school year, on 
early release days and during the 
summer. Our primary focus for professional development is aligning instruction to meet the California State Standards and the
 
implementation of our 
adopted materials for mathematics and English Language Arts/English Langua
ge development. Professional learning opportunities integrate content 
development and research
-
based instructional practices to meet the needs of all learners, especially English Learners, Students with Disabilities and 
Socio
-
economically Disadvantaged. Pr
ofessional Development in SMFCSD is grounded in the California State Standards and the research from the 
California State Adopted ELA/ELD, Mathematics and NGSS Frameworks. Elementary teachers have the opportunity for training in l
anguage and literacy, 
scie
nce and mathematics. Middle School teachers receive subject specific professional development on the California Standards and
 
strategies to support 
conceptual understanding and improve student learning.
 
 
Teachers engage in a variety of Professional Develop
ment structures including, site or department specific PD, teacher learning communities within and 
across sites and in departments or grade levels 
-
 
both in large and small groups. Our district also coordinates district
-
level training with site
-
based 
profe
ssional development opportunities based on site data. Over the last year, district and site leaders developed professional le
arning opportunities by 
evaluating and adjusting our professional growth strategies, first by gathering immediate feedback (e.g., e
xit tickets and feedback surveys) from teacher 
and leader training and collaboration sessions. This data was then used to adjust and focus training and collaboration strate
gies during the year. We also 
evaluate and adjust professional growth strategies thr
ough on
-
going examination of student performance data (academic and wellness). District 
leadership meets quarterly with school leaders to review current student data, to identify the professional growth causes for
 
student successes and 
challenges, to monit


SPSA. In parallel with this work, site leaders lead the same process with teacher teams using more specific data (e.g. grade
-
level and classroom data), 
where they couple that data with teacher reflections on their professional learning and plan month
-
to
-
month adjustments in professional learning 
strategies and yearly adjustments in their SPSAs. District leaders also lead a simi
lar process with SMFCSD teacher union representatives to elicit their 
feedback on the district professional growth strategies and to get their recommendations for strategy adjustments in the dist
rict LCAP. Additionally, 
starting this year, SMFCSD will gath
er once
-
a
-
year survey feedback from teachers on their professional learning needs and on their experience of current 
strategies which will inform yearly adjustments to LCAP and SPSA professional growth strategies.
 
 
Our beginning teachers also receive addit
ional professional development provided by our District
-
based Induction program. Veteran teachers can 
participate in a Peer Assistance Review (PAR) program for individual support.
