By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

turn, our students value learning. In addition, our school offers an array of
 
opportunities to engage students in their 
campus community outside of the classroom by participating in clubs, music, support programs, and athletics. Over one 
third of our students are involved in some extra

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Edwin Markham School first opened in 1961. The buildings are well constructed, but their age demands constant 
maintenance. The custodians and the 
principal conduct monthly maintenance/safety checks.
 
 
Major repairs are made at Markham during the summer months. Classroom modernization was completed during the 
summer of 2008. Twelve classrooms were modernized to include state
-
of
-
the
-
art computer networ
k infrastructure. The 
school buildings and grounds provide adequate space for teaching and learning. Our library, science building and music 
building are exemplary facilities. The rest rooms, floors, walls, plumbing and electrical systems are old but funct
ional. The 
entire roof was replaced during the summer of 2003. A new music building was completed during the 1999
-
00 school year 
and is an excellent addition to our campus and exemplary music program. During the 2017
-
18 school year, classroom 
lighting was 
retrofitted.. During the 2004
-
05 school year, the new gymnasium and a new three
-
laboratory science building 
were constructed. These two new buildings are outstanding additions to the Markham campus. The gymnasium is 
regularly used by the community for recr
eational purposes.
 
 
The entire staff, including the custodial staff, works to keep the buildings and grounds clean, free of litter and graffiti. 
Graffiti is removed as soon as it is discovered, and this has resulted in a drastic reduction in graffiti at th
e site. Community 
volunteer days have been a great help to keeping our campus looking beautiful.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Markham Middle School 
encourages parents to serve in any of our many groups that support the campus. Our Parent Club 
meets once a month and has a page on our web site as well as a Facebook page for maximizing communication.  School 
Site Council, the District Budget Committee, H
ealth Education Advisory Committee (HEAC), District English Learner 
Advisory Committee (DELAC),  Superintendent's Parent Advisory Committee,  English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC),  
Kiwanis Builders Club, Athletics Program, etc., all have parent and co
mmunity involvement within their organizations. We 
need and encourage our parents to become involved with our campus.
 
 
Parents have complete access to their child's grades through our Aeries online grade book system. Parents are also 
encouraged to communic
ate with teachers through email.  In addition we hold four days of parent
-
teacher
-
student 
conferences in the fall, and two days in the spring. Newsletters are sent home monthly at the end of every grading period. 
We make frequent use of our automated phone
 
call system to keep parents informed of important dates and when 
information is being sent home with students.  Announcements are posted three days a week and are emailed to parents 
upon request. For students needing additional support, Markham staff regu
larly meet with parents for Student Study 
Teams, Response to Intervention, Behavior Support Plans and Individualized Education Plans.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The school's Emergency Operations Plan is reviewed every year during staff development days before school starts. Staff 
is updated on the plan and made aware of the important details in the 
plan. Markham practices a "Lock Down Drill", "Fire 
Drill" and " Bus Evacuation" during the first week of the school year with all staff and students. The Plan is always reviewe
d 
and revisions are considered after every major emergency.
 
 
Monthly evacuation 
emergency drills are conducted to keep students and staff attuned to safety procedures.  Evacuation 
drills to alternate sites require staff and students to follow alternate instructions and keep staff and students flexible an
d 
responsive to most scenarios.
 
Coaching staff is trained to administer CPR and first
-
aid and has gone through training in 
recognition of concussions. Additionally, the school nurse works one and one
-
half days per week assisting office personnel, 
staff, students, and parents with health
 
concerns and is available by phone as needed.. Yard supervision is provided by 
teachers, aides, and principal before and after school and at all passing periods, breaks, and lunch.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-

Markham has added Instructional Aide time in many areas to provide more support for 
students and teachers across the 
campus. Our Bilingual Aide time was increased to support our EL population. Our Special Education Aide time was 
increased to allow for more campus supervision without taking away service time from Special Education. We have
 
a full
-
time position to manage our Alternative Learning Center where students can refocus before returning to a classroom, 
work quietly on teacher assignments away from the classroom, get extra help when needed on academic and personal 
issues, and serve o
ut teacher
-
assigned detentions. The library is open before and after school for tutoring and study hall 
to help students who are dropped off early or have to wait for rides home. Markham offers the Academic Grace Program 
(AGP) each quarter after school for
 
an hour, three days a week. The AGP program is for students on Academic Probation 
and is supervised by classroom teachers. Students focus on completing class work and online remediation in areas they 
are struggling.  Credentialed math teachers provide mat
h tutoring 3 days a week.  Students can also take advantage of 
homework help in the morning 4 days a week from a credentialed teacher.  Special Education services are offered to 
eligible students based on the students' educational needs as specified in Ind
ividualized Education Program (IEPs) plans. 
Eligible students participate in the National School Lunch Program.

Staff Development is provided in three full days before the school year begins and during early release time on Mondays 
throughout the year.  Staff is encouraged to pursue professional development on a 
regular basis and has access to site 
funding that will help pay for all training expenses. Professional Development is delivered through all types of modalities, 
including conferences, classes, webinars, tutoring and after school support. Staff regularly r
eports back to the school board 
about their training and how they plan on using what they have learned. Many of our staff have become trainers in a wide 
variety of skills and programs.
