By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

We value the 
contributions of our local community and recognize that they are essential to our success. With support 
from our very active PTA, Cherry Chase has developed an extensive partnership with families to ensure that teachers and 
parents cooperate for the benefi
t of all students. Parent education is provided regularly on topics such as instruction, 
technology, student safety, and school climate at Coffees with the Principal and regular PTA meetings or events.
 
 
Families of our students who are English Learners are
 
invited to attend four English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) 
meetings per year, where they learn about programs at the school and in the District that support the education of their 
students. They also have the opportunity to provide input on the deve
lopment of the annual School Plan.
 
 
Five parents represent the parent community on the School Site Council, committed to the establishment of goals and 
budget for the school as expressed through the School Plan. This committee meets regularly throughout th
e school year.
 
 
Other opportunities for family involvement include, but are not limited to, volunteering for or just attending the following 
events and activities:
 
 
1.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Cherry Chase has a Comprehensive School Safety Plan to ensure a safe and orderly environment. The goals outlined in the 
plan are:
 
1.
 
To strive to ensure that school and classroom environments promote the social
-
emotional well
-
being of all 
students and staff m
embers, and
 
2.
 
To follow through on providing and/or updating supplies needed for each classroom and space throughout the 
school to support emergency response actions.
 
 
In the fall of 2018 our staff trained with a District
-
hired consultant regarding procedure
s for an incident command 
emergency response structure. Another staff training is scheduled during the Spring of 2020.  We will continue to refine 
our understanding and implementation of that process throughout the school year. Our School Site Council revi
ews our 
safety plan annually to identify areas for improvement and to propose solutions.  The current version of the Safety Plan 
was approved on December 12, 2019.
 
 
We also are focusing efforts on pedestrian and traffic safety through our Walk and Roll 
to School program, which is 
coordinated by a parent volunteer and teacher liaison to the District program. This venture encourages all families to keep 
student safety a priority, especially at drop
-
off and pick
-
up times.

During the 2018

2019 school year we funded one after

school tutorial to provide small group intervention for 1st and 2nd 
graders who were achieving below grade level in the area of literacy. This was taught by a credentialed teacher using the 
SIPPS program
 
and was funded through our SLIP allocation.
 
 
We also provided support to our English Learners who were achieving below proficiency in English Language Arts. These 
students worked with a paraprofessional in small groups four times per week for 30 minutes e
ach time to focus on 
necessary English language skills. The program was sustained through LCAP funds.
 
 
With support from centralized special education funds, we were able to provide Response to Intervention support to 
identified students who were able to w
ork alongside other students in our resource department.
 
 
We work in a variety of ways to differentiate instruction within the general education classroom environment to meet the 
needs of all students, those in need of extension as well as those in need of
 
intervention.

In alignment with the school district, Cherry Chase annually provides three full days of staff development and eight 
Teacher Learning Days (TLDs) with 90 minutes of release time weekly for all K
-
3 teachers and 120 minutes weekly release 
time for all 4
-
5 te
achers. A site leadership team selects the topics for these trainings in response to current trends in the 
District as well as the observed needs of the school community. On two of the three staff development days, all classified 
employees also participate
 
in separate training that is organized and led by District
-
level leaders. We have a robust culture 
of professional growth as outlined below.
 
 
During the 2016
-
2017 school year, we focused our professional development in the areas of writing, science, and s
chool 
climate. In addition to the district
-
scheduled PD times, we provided three half
-
day release sessions per grade level over 
the course of the year. Each team had the opportunity to select their area of focus for those sessions in response to 
analysis o
f student data as well as their need to develop professional expertise with new science materials. 
 
 
Our science PD sessions were led by our own Science L
ead teachers, who rolled out the new Physical Science materials 
with teachers, who then spent more time during release sessions or in grade
-
level team meetings developing familiarity 
with the materials and planning appropriate instruction. 
 
 
Our school cli
mate work was led by our partner agencies: Project Cornerstone, Playworks, and Acknowledge Alliance. They 
either shared information with teachers (PC and PW) or provided after
-
school resilience support to a self
-
selected group 
of teachers (AA). 
 
 
Work on w
riting included training led by a presenter from Heinemann, release time for model lesson observation and 
debriefing, follow
-
up work led by our assistant principal at a staff development day and at a TLD. We designed this PD in 
response to results from our
 
benchmark writing assessments.
 
 
Teachers also had the opportunity to participate in workshops that were provided outside the scope of our school and 
that aligned with our overarching goals. Several teachers took advantage of that opportunity during the ye
ar and attended 
workshops in PBL, GLAD, and writers workshop. In addition, all Kindergarten teachers participated in the Foundational 
Literacy series provided by Sunnyvale School District.

PD opportunities for the 2017
-
2018 school year included: extended 
Writers Workshop training and model lessons with 
Heinemann presenter Kelly Boswell, deeper work on ELD instruction in the classroom 
-
 
designated as well as integrated, 
and instructional development with the new Life Sciences units. We worked with our Leade
rship Team to identify and 
prioritize topics for each of the District
-
provided sessions and provided one half
-
day release session per trimester per 
grade level. Topics for these sessions were selected in response to assessment results and teacher growth ne
eds and were 
aligned to our overarching PD goals for the year. 
 
 
In addition, all 1st grade teachers were trained by the District in Foundational Literacy skills. 
 
 
During the 2018
-
2019 school year Cherry Chase teachers were refining their expertise in the
 
areas of writing, science, and 
technology, and continued to strengthen their practice in the area of English Language Development. Three site
-
based 
staff development days, three after
-
school district
-
wide grade
-
alike meetings, and monthly teacher learning
 
days are 
providing the platforms in which we are expanding our professional practice for the benefit of our students. In addition, 
each grade level will have two half
-
day release sessions for deeper collaboration around team
-
selected topics. 
 
 
Individual 
teachers and staff members have also participated in voluntary off
-
site trainings in writing, leadership, social
-
emotional learning, math and technology. The entire 2nd grade team and one new 1st grade teacher are being trained by 
the District in Foundatio
nal literacy skills and strategies. 
 
 
All professional development is targeted toward increasing and refining our skills so that we can enhance learning and 
increase achievement for all students.
