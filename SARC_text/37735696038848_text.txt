School Description
 
Welcome to Laurel Elementary School. Laurel Elementary school is committed to providing all of its 
students the highest quality education possible
-
we want every student to know that they are cared 

 

all its students with a Well
-
Rounded education that engages, inspires and nurtures confidence and 
character needed to achieve their goals and succeed in the 21st Century. Our school works 
collaboratively with pare
nts to provide a safe and nurturing school environment for all students. 
Our teachers care about our students and work tirelessly to improve their academic achievement. 
Our staff is dedicated to ensuring success for all students.
 
 
Students receive 
daily explicit reading and writing instruction following our newly adopted ELA 
curriculum while some students receive small group guided reading instruction as needed in order 
to meet their individual needs. Teachers regularly monitor student progress and 
review student 
assessment data to determine whether the interventions are working and make adjustments 
accordingly. Laurel has two part
-
time literacy intervention teachers that provide daily
-
targeted 
small group guided reading and writing instruction for m
ore than 70 students, K
-
4th grade, 
including intervention support for all our newcomer students. In addition, Laurel has developed a 
collaborative partnership with MiraCosta College. Throughout the year, college students routinely 
volunteer at Laurel provi
ding support in the classroom and on the playground. In many cases, the 
college volunteers attended Laurel as children and now serve as role models for our students.

Class Initiative provides a unique literacy exper
ience for 
our 3rd or 4th grade students, which culminates with a visit to the college.

child, we have implemented 
multiple programs, opportunities and experiences that not only support our stud
ents, but our 
parents as well. Students receive fresh fruit and vegetable snacks three days week through the 
California Fresh Fruit & Vegetable Grant. Feeding America distributes 20 to 25 pounds of nutritious 
food to all Laurel families twice a month. The 
Girls on the Run program inspires our 4th and 5th 
grade girls to be joyful, healthy and confident using a fun, experience
-
based curriculum, which 
creatively integrates running. In addition, last year we have added the Young Triton Boy's running 
club. Boys 
from 2nd through 5th grade train and run twice a week for 8
-
weeks. The running 
program culminates with a 5K Run. Our after school Robotics Club motivates and inspires our 
students to create, design, and innovate. Last year, laurel kicked off In addition, t
hroughout the 
year, Laurel offers engaging evening events for the entire family such Literacy Night, Math Night, 
and Art Night.
 
 
We are especially excited to share our launch of our Signature School Plan. The Laurel Signature 
School Plan is a five
-
year pla
n with a focus on Science, Technology, and Arts Education (VAPA) with 
the overarching integration of Project Based Learning as a model to support the implementation of 
Science, Technology, and the Arts. The Laurel Signature Plan consists of two phases. The
 
first phase 
involves the full implementation of Project Lead the Way curriculum in grade K
-
5th grade. The 
second phase consist of the development and implementation of a comprehensive Arts Education 
program. In fact, our 1st
-
5th grade teachers are collabo
rating with professional artist to integrate 
art standards into their lessons and projects. While our fundamental mission is to ensure all our 
students meet and exceed math and language arts standards, we believe that our Signature School 
Plan will provide
 
a learning environment that emphasizes authentic real world problems, engages 
students in inquiry and exploration, promotes creativity and collaboration, and provides 
opportunities for students to apply what they know in meaningful ways.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each ye
ar, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF
) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorit
ies. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/gua
rdians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

(English Language Acquisition Committee). Parents are invited to volunteer
 
in classrooms, participate on field trips, and attend school activities. We hold 
parent information meetings on different topics during the year. Formal parent
-
teacher conferences are held in October, and many teachers schedule 
informal parent conferences
 
throughout the year. Regular communication with parents is integral to our program. Office and classroom notices sent 
home with students are provided in both English and Spanish. We use an automated dial
-
out system to call parents with reminders and impor
tant 

lso have Family Math 
Night, which provides opportunities for parents to interact in math activities with their children and ma
th games for families to play with their children 
as well. Family Literacy Night offers our parents and their children a time and place, and some helpful guidelines from an ex
perienced teacher and 
volunteer guests to read and share their ideas. The purpose
 
of Family Literacy Night is to motivate and encourage students to read for individual 
enjoyment and build a stronger sense of literacy as a benefit to the family and to the school community. In addition, Family 
Art Night offers students and 
families an op
portunity to express themselves in a fun and creative way.
 
 
The Latino Family Literacy Project is our family reading program (Family Stories / Cuentos Familiares). The program uses bili
ngual books that are 
appropriate for reading levels grades 1
-
4. The pro
gram teaches parents the importance of establishing a family reading routine along with the skills they 
need to share literature with their child. Lastly, the Words Alive and Raising the Reader Program provide TK &  kindergarten 
parents early literacy supp
ort 
and teach parents strategies and the foundations of reading.

School Safety Plan
 
 
Our campus is completely fenced and all gates are locked during school hours. All visitors are required to check in at the of
fice and receive a visitor pass 
before entering on campus. We have five duty supervisors who monitor the cafeteria and playgrounds.
 
Our duty supervisors are provided training and 
coaching regularly throughout the year. In addition, the principal and assistant principal supervise the playground during re
cess and lunch. Teachers 
supervise students at all other times, including walking t
o and from places on campus.
 
 
We revise the Safe School Plan every spring and review it throughout the year with staff and parents at faculty and parent me
etings. Our goals include 
continuing to train & practice for crisis response, ensuring that the campu
s is secure, and providing professional development for staff and duty 
supervisors on bullying, positive behavior interventions, social emotional learning, and restorative justice practices. We up
date our Crisis Response Plan 
every fall and review it with 
staff throughout the year at staff meetings. Teachers review the procedures with their students. We conduct fire drills and 
lock
-
down drills monthly and evacuation/disaster drills at least once each quarter, and debrief after all drills to determine the 
ar
eas in need of 
improvement. Lastly, we collaborate with the Oceanside Police Department to conduct surprise drills every fall.
 
 
Palomar Family Counseling Services located on campus provides counseling for children who exhibit indicators of emotional dif
fic
ulties, problem behavior 
or indications of trauma or deprivation. These services include: an intensive clinical approach using group therapy, play the
rapy, parent education and 
behavior modification techniques provided by specially trained and qualified sp
ecialists. In addition, PFCS offers Social Emotional Learning (SEL)

ts not responding to Tier 1 supports.
 
 
Under the BEST (Building Effective Schools Together) model, staff is provided resources, professional development, and suppor
t that aids the school in 
improving class wide and school
-
wide discipline including 
student support groups on anger management, social skills, and/or conflict management. The
