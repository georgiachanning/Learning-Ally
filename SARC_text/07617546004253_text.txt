Description

Mission
 
Statement
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
At
 
Sequoia
 
Elementary
 
we
 
are
 
engaged
 
learners.
  
We
 
celebrate
 
our
 
diversity
 
and
 
the
 
diversity
 
of
 
the
 
world
 
around
 
us
 
as
 
we
 
work
 
together
 
to
 
learn
 
and
 
grow.
 
The
 
mission
 
of
 
Sequoia
 
Elementary
 
is
 
to
 
develop
 
compassionate
 
and
 
lifelong
 
learners
 
who
 
understand
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
part
 
of
 
a
 
global
 
community.
  
Students
 
become
 
critical
 
thinkers
 
through
 
an
 
emphasis
 
on
 
foundational
 
skills,
 
collaboration
 
and
 
inquiry.
  
This
 
is
 
accomplished
 
through
 
a
 
mutually
 
supportive
 
partnership
 
of
 
parents,
 
faculty
 
and
 
administration
 
that
 
provide
 
a
 
safe,
 
respectful
 
and
 
joyful
 
learning
 
environment
 
that
 
honors
 
individual
 
differences.
