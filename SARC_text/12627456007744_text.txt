Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Ridgewood Elementary School provides a safe, clean, tobacco
-
free educational environment for students. One 
maintenance employee and two custodians ensure the good condition and cleanliness of our buildings, restrooms, and 
grounds. All classrooms and suppor
t services rooms are equipped with a telephone, an intercom system, and access to 
the Internet. A security system is present to protect every room.
 
 
Visitors are welcomed at Ridgewood School and sign in at the school office. Due to the close
-
knit nature of
 
our school, 
unfamiliar visitors on campus are very rare and are immediately greeted by school personnel.
 
 
Ridgewood Elementary School was built in 1957. The school has 14 regular classrooms, a library, a multipurpose room 
(the commons, where assemblies 
take place two mornings each week), a student support resource room (the Learning 
Lane), and a breakfast room, which is also available for small group instruction and is leased to a private business to 
provide quality after
-
school care.
 
 
The playground has
 
enjoyed recent equipment upgrades, and borders two baseball fields, a playing field, a wall ball court, 
and our own redwood forest. All facilities and equipment are designed for primary students.

The Cutten District implemented the Leadership Team in 2014. Teachers apply to be on the team and receive
 
an annual 
stipend of $2,000. This Team, that includes both administrators, meets weekly to plan 
professional
 
development 
opportunities for teacher and evaluate the effectiveness of professional development
 
opportunities offered. Input is 
regularly sought from certificated staff to identify areas of focus for
 
professional development.
 
 
Professional de
velopment is offered during our preservice days at the beginning of each school year; during
 
our early 
release collaborative Wednesdays; and several times a year, teachers are offered a stipend to extend
 
their workday into 
the evening. The District reimbur
ses teachers for registration to selected professional
 
development opportunities offered 
through the County Office of Education, and other professional resources.
 
To evaluate our system for professional growth 
and improvement for teachers, we survey certif
icated staff,
 
teachers meet in grade level teams to assess needs, and we 
meet as a district several times a year to examine
 
student achievement data to help assess need for professional 
development.
 
 
New teachers participate in the Teacher Induction Progra
m, formerly known as BTSA and are mentored by
 
veteran 

 
(NCTIP) is a two
-
year 
program that provides a link between the skills acquired in the Preliminary Credential
 
Program to the experiences in the 
classroom. Candidates work with a Mentor Teacher to further develop the
 
knowledge and skills needed to achieve 
competency in the California Standards. Mentors provide support,
 
experiences, and professional development to 
help 
candidates meet the CCTC requirements for a Clear
 
Credential. When a new teacher is hired, experienced teachers provide 
continual support in all aspects of the
 
profession. Grade level teams meet regularly to provide assistance and support to 
our newes
t teachers.
