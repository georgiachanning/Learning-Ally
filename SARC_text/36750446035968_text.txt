By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

CAMPUS SUPERVISION
 
Proctors are strategically placed in various areas of the campus to supervise students as they enter school grounds. During 
recess, teachers or proctors are on the playground 
to monitor behavior and playground activities. Proctors provide 
supervision during lunch recess and monitor both cafeteria and playground activities. At the end of the day, teachers 
monitor designated dismissal areas (buses and two pick up areas
-
drive up a
nd church) to ensure students leave campus 
in a safe and orderly manner.  Proctors attend regularly scheduled meetings to improve supervision, communication, and 
professional development. Proctors have received training for Kagan Win
-
Win Discipline to offe
r tactics for addressing 
negative behavior.  These procedures are reviewed during frequent proctor meetings. Specific student needs are 
addressed: Health concerns, physical limitations, discipline, and any current issues.
 
 
CAMPUS MAINTENANCE The custodial 
staff and district maintenance department work closely together to ensure 
playgrounds, classrooms, and campus grounds are well
-
maintained and kept safe and functioning for students, staff, and 
visitors. The assistant principal and lead custodian meet weekl
y to coordinate and plan school maintenance procedures. 
The Principal, Assistant Principal, School Secretary, Administrative Secretary, Attendance Secretary, Health Tech and Lead 
Custodian meet frequently to discuss custodial needs, projects, and special e
vents. The Lead Custodian then directs 
remaining school custodians on a daily basis. Hand
-
held radios enhance two
-
way communication efforts and help facilitate 
an immediate response to emergency situations.
 
 
One full
-
time custodian (Lead Custodian), one fu
ll
-
time evening custodian, and one part
-
time evening custodian is 
assigned to Eucalyptus Elementary. Every morning before school begins, the lead day custodian inspects facilities for safety 
hazards or other conditions that need attention prior to students
 
and staff arrival. Any unsafe conditions, vandalism, or 
graffiti are removed before students arrive on campus. The evening custodians clean classrooms, desks, restrooms, and 
whiteboards, and are responsible for set up and take down of equipment and/or fur
niture for afternoon and evening 
events.
 
 
Eucalyptus Elementary works closely with the district's Maintenance & Operations (M&O) department for larger projects, 
routine facilities maintenance projects, and school inspections. The most recent facilities ins
pection at Eucalyptus 
Elementary took place on 8/21/19; our facility required minor maintenance. M&O employs a work order process that 
enables Eucalyptus Elementary to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs,urgent repairs, or special projects. 
Emergency
 
situations are regularly resolved in one hour or less.
 
The School Facility Good Repair Status Report was completed on July 24, 2019.
 
 
Planned or recently completed facility improvements:
 
Installation of overhead projectors
 
Portable classroom added (rm 33)
 
Painting of exterior of school

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

All professional development activities in Hesperia 
Unified School District revolve around the California State Content 
Standards and Frameworks and are research
-
based.
 
 
The Certificated staff builds teaching skills and concepts through participation in ongoing training sponsored by the distric
t 
and school 
site. Each school site identifies and coordinates its own staff development activities based upon individual 
student needs, school site plans, and the districts designated focus areas. Supplemental training involving curriculum, 
teaching strategies, and me
thodologies in the content areas of reading/language arts and math were provided at site 
request to Academic Coaches.
 
 
Supplemental training topics were selected by the school Leadership teams. Training programs and topics were chosen 
based upon the school
 
focus and student needs. Results from California Standardized Tests and district single assessments, 
teacher feedback, and findings from classroom observations help identify areas for improvement and training programs 
that will enable teachers to deliver 
a challenging and rigorous standards
-
based education fostering student success and 
proficiency.
 
 
The district supplements site
-
level professional development to follow up and support year
-
round and ongoing programs 
centered on the district's focus areas of
 
reading and math. Supplemental professional development is offered throughout 
the school year on early student release days, during summer vacation, and on weekends. Staff development topics and 
focus areas are identified and selected based upon input fro
m Principals' Roundtable, teacher survey results and 
determined site needs. The Principals' Roundtable provides opportunities for school principals to discuss and share 
training needs based upon data analysis and classroom observations from each school sit
e.

based program providing support and skill building through 
formative assessment and individualized support based on assessment. The New Teachers Academy sponsors new teacher 
orientations each year to support ye
ar

round hiring practices; the orientation is a comprehensive overview of the district's 
policies, school law, English language learners support, curriculum, instruction, and grade
-
level and content area 
specialties. Additional mentors are assigned to newe
r teachers as needed.  Beginning in the 2019
-
2020 school year, an 
Instructional Coach position was created for schools.  The role/responsibilities of that position offer support to all staff 
including paraprofessional staff.
