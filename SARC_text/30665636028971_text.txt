School Description
 
Las
 
Lomas is a Transitional Kindergarten through Sixth Grade school located in La Habra. We are 
fortunate to have an extraordinary staff of 22 fully credentialed classroom teachers, a full time 
Resource Specialist and a shared Speech/Language Therapist and Ps
ychologist. In addition to our 
general education population, we also provide services for Pre
-
School Special Education, and LEAP 
for students identified as needing these support services. The staff is dedicated to providing a safe 
and engaging learning env
ironment that promotes critical thinking and learning for our students. 
Our goal is to provide the skills necessary for our students to become productive citizens. The staff 
works extremely hard to impart the importance of being responsible, respectful stu
dents who 
strive to develop a love of learning.
 
 
Our Entrepreneur Exploration focus provides our students real
-
world experiences, through hands
-
on project
-
based learning opportunities. Through a close collaboration with the local businesses of 
La Habra, 

explore problems that focus on diverse community issues. Their young minds are inspired to 
engage in creating and learning beyond the textbook. These partnerships allow stu
dents to think 
creatively and critically about community issues and then develop the problem solving and 
communication skills necessary to be engaged learners for the challenging future ahead of them.
 
 
We are proud to offer additional enriching extra
-
curri
cular activities for our students. The Lang Lang 
Music Foundation provides our 2nd, 3rd and 4th grade students the opportunity to learn 
keyboarding/piano skills with a trained music teacher two times a week. The Segrestrom Center for 
the Arts brings Disney
 
Musicals in Schools for our third
-
sixth grade students. Students will learn all 
about theater and perform a live musical theater production in the spring. All of these experiences 
will ultimately improve student academic performance, their attitudes towar
d career possibilities 
and motivate the students to persevere and seek out a variety of career options.
 
 
Our teachers work in weekly Professional Learning Communities (PLC) to collaborate and discuss 
student achievement. Intervention and enrichment opportu
nities are decided as well as how to 
differentiate instruction to meet the needs of all students. Teachers develop short
-
term goals for 
students and then use a variety of assessments to monitor student growth and adjust their 
instruction as needed in all i
nstructional areas. Teachers are continuously asking themselves four 
key questions when discussing student achievement to ensure student success.
 
 

 
What do we expect students to learn?
 

 
How will we know when they have learned it?
 

 
How will we respond when the

 

 
How will we respond when they already know it?
 
 
The parents and the community are a key component to the success of our students; therefore, in 
addition to our passion for academic success for all of our students, our staff works hard to dev
elop 
relationships with our parents and extended families. We strive to create an environment in which 
parents are partners in education here at Las Lomas.
 
 
Please come and visit us! We would love for you to meet the Las Lomas team and see what fantastic 
w
ork our students are doing on a daily basis!

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Types of Services Funded
 
In addition to the general school budget, Las Lomas has two main sources 
of income: Fede
ral Title I funds and Supplemental & Concentration (S&C) 
funds. The majority of our general school budget goes toward teacher 
salaries and benefits. Title I funds pay for part of our library technician and 
two of our educational assistants. S&C funds provi
de three instructional 
assistants to help our English Learners. Funds are also used to help pay for 
educational materials and supplies, supplemental books to support our 
language arts, science and social studies programs and for the purchase of 
technology,
 
such as iPads, for our students use to enhance their learning 
process.

Each year the District looks at student achievement data along with 
teacher requests 
for specific trainings to determine the plan for the four 
Districtwide professional development days.  In 2017
-
2018, training 
focused on new English Language Arts adoptions, Wonders and Amplify.  
In 2018
-
2019 training focused on new Mathematics adoptions, 
Bridges and 
Math Links.  In 2019
-
2020, training focused on developing Multi
-
Tiered 
System of Supports (MTSS).
 
 
In addition to the Districtwide trainings, each site works with a consultant 
from InnovateEd to develop Cycles of Inquiry around their strategic 
focus.  
Teacher leaders attend seven days of training to analyze student data, 
develop a strategic focus for the year, implement evidence based lessons, 
and analyze student work.  Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSAs) 
assigned to each site work with all t
eachers throughout the year during the 
school day and during PLC time to support implementation of the strategic 
focus.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district 
makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We have many ways for parents to participate in the life of our school, and we depend on parents to 
keep our programs running smoothly. Parents are 
asked to join our School Site Council (SSC) which helps develop our School Site Plan and budget. Parents of English learners 
are vital to our English 
Language Advisory Council (ELAC) to provide input to our E
nglish Learner Program. The PTA organizes fundraisers to pay for field trips and special 
assemblies. We ask that all parents attend Back
-
to
-
School Night in the fall, Open House in the Spring, parent
-
teacher conferences in October and February 
and various f
amily learning events scheduled throughout the school year.
 
 
Our Parent Institute for Quality Education (PIQE) program is a very important program to help our parents learn all about our
 
school culture and how

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the fol
lowing information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Students are supervised 30 minutes prior to school dur
ing recess and lunch by staff. Teachers regularly review the rules for responsible, respectful, and 
safe behavior at school.  All staff members who are responsible for supervising students on the playground during recess or b
reak. Additionally, all staff 
m
embers have been extensively trained on the procedures and protocols for student safety, behavior expectations, emergency pro
cedures and 
unidentified persons on campus. Visitors are required to check in and wear a badge while on campus.
 
 
We have a School S
afety Plan and Code of Conduct that is shared with teachers, students and parents at the beginning of each school year. Fire,
 
earthquake, and intruder drills are practiced on a regular basis so staff, students and parent volunteers are familiar with t
he pr
ocedures in case of an 
emergency. In addition to parents supplying an emergency care packet for their child, the school has emergency first
-
 
aid, food, and water supplies.  
School Safety Plan was last revised and reviewed in October 2019.
