By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

wrongs; and help others. Along with a PBIS system students and staff apply these principles to ensure that Eisenhut

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The District takes great effort to ensure 
that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, beginning 
with the 2004
-
05 school year the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of 
Public School Construction. The results of this
 
survey will be available at the school office, at the District Office, or on the 
Internet at http://www.opssc.dgs.ca.gov/. Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the 
efforts made to ensure that students are provided with a c
lean, safe, and functional learning environment. The school 
opened in 1978. The school has 30 classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library, 1 computer labs and an administration 
building. The main campus was built in 1978. Two relocatable and three ancillary
 
offices classrooms were added in 1999. 
A new library was added in 2013, and three new relocatable classrooms were added in 2016. District maintenance staff 
ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complete
d in a timely manner. 
An online work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. 
Providing a clean learning environment is a District priority. The principal works closely with the custodial 
staff to develop 
cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school. The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance 
Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school district with expenditures
 
for 
major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and flooring. Deferred maintenance projects that were 
complet
ed in the 2016
-
17 school year include: flooring replaced in two classrooms . Seal coating and striping was done to 
all asphalt paving; and, the interior exterior walls at Eisenhut Elementary School were re
-
painted as needed.  Eisenhut 
Elementary School con
tinues to achieve "good" on our inspections.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
