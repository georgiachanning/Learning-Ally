Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Description: A schoolwide focus on safety, health and well being has resulted in a campus that is virtually free of violence,
 
drugs, and crime. Grounds are kept litter
-
free and supervised by a full
-
time custodian.  Inspections by the Napa Fire 
Department a
ddress code compliance and assure the facilities are safe for students and staff.  Our Comprehensive School 
Safety Plan (CSSP), modeled on the Incident Command System, addresses all components of SB187 including biannual 
Crime Reports, Student Discipline, 
Sexual Harassment, Dealing with Dangerous Pupils, Crises Response Plan, Dress Code, 
and Alternative Programs.  The CSSP is reviewed annually ( Oct.18, 2018) by District Maintenance and Operations and the 
Site Safety Committee that includes staff, parents, 
and representatives of law enforcement.  Emergency equipment has 
been supplied for each classroom and for the school as a whole.  Fire and/or Evacuation drills are held monthly.  During 
the first weeks of school, teachers and the principal teach expectatio
ns for student safety, playground, rules, classroom 
behavior, bullying, and harassment.  Discipline follows the restorative practices as defined in NVUSD "Standards for 
Student Behavior".  Our school BEST Team monitors student behavior issues to determine 
when additional support is 
needed for students and staff.

2019 Staff Professional Development continues to be focused on two primary areas: AVID and Accelerate Math.  Our 
goal is still to connect these two areas so that teachers 
feel that all professional learning is supporting the goal of high 
expectations for all students. Students at West Park are no longer declining in Math.  At the end of the 16

17 school year, 
39/35/17 % of our grade 3/4/5 students met or exceeded proficienc
y on the MATH portion of the CAASPP, and overall 
student scores were no longer decreasing.  Students continue to struggle in communicating their reasoning.  This year we 
are focusing on AVID strategies utilizing Costa's Levels of Questioning and writing in
 
math to increase rigor in student 
learning.  Teachers in grades K

2018 Staff Professional Development is focused on two primary areas: AVID and Accelerate Math.  Our goal is to 
connect these two areas so that teachers feel that all professional learning is supporting the same goal of high
 
expectations 
for all students. Students at West Park have struggled in recent years, especially with Math.  At the end of the 16
-
17 school 
year, 35/17/33 % of our grade 3/4/5 students met or exceeded proficiency on the MATH portion of the CAASPP, and 
over
all student scores were decreasing.  Students struggled especially in communicating their reasoning.  AVID strategies, 
especially in the areas of goal setting and writing in math will support student learning.  Teacher leaders in grades 2,4, a 
site based c
oach, and the school Principal attended AVID Summer Institute in July of 2017.  Their learning was shared with 
school staff through site
-
based professional learning regularly during staff meeting time. Accelerate Math is a partnership 
project funded by Nap
aLearns, a community
-
based non
-
profit. Through this partnership, all site teachers participated in 
a full day of training in the summer of 2017. Teachers in grades 1,2 and 4, along with our site based coach, also participate
d 
in 3 paid professional learnin
g days after school, 4 on
-
site coaching days with a Math Learning Center Coach and ongoing 
coaching with a District Math Coach.
