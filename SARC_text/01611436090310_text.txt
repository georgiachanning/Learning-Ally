DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district
 
and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Intern
et access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use 
restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a 
workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a 
workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and P
lanned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district administers a scheduled maintenance program to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well maintained and
 
in good repair. A work 
order process alerts district personnel of any maintenance needed to
 
be performed and ensures that emergencies are given the highest priority.
 
 
Safety issues are the top priority for Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors inspect school sites cont
inually and complete repairs 
in a timely manner. They u
se a work order process to ensure an efficient, prioritized repair process. The district maintenance staff has indicated that
 
100% of all toilets on school grounds are in working order.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent exper
ts from our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction.
 
 

that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of 
the date of the report. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.7

education popula
tion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
ali
gned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that 
satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

State 
Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each scho
ol site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents, families and community members have multiple opportunities to be involved at Thousand Oaks Elementary School. Our Of
fice of Family 
Engagement and Equity provides 
parent/caregiver support and interaction that contributes to a wonderful partnership between home and school, 
benefiting the children at Thousand Oaks. Some parents/caregivers help in classrooms as room parents, tutors and helpers, ass
ist with yard supervi
sion, 
chaperone field trips and help with special events.  Parents/caregivers also assume leadership roles and become members of ou
r parent groups and  
advisory committees.  They serve as leaders and members of our School Site Council (SSC) and our English
 
Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), and 
represent our school on district advisory committees. Parents/caregivers lead and participate in parent groups such as Voices
 
of the Village (Black Parent 
Group) and the PTA.  These parent groups promote community an
d involvement with their many school events and celebrations, such as our Harvest 
Festival, Black History Month, Asian
-
American Heritage and Latinx celebrations.  Our PTA hosts numerous events that provide many opportunities for 
involvement annually, inclu
ding Book Fairs, Science Fair and Math and Literacy Nights.  Please feel free to contact our Office of Family Engagement and 
Equity Specialist Laura Rivas at at 510

State Priority: School Climate
 
The
 
SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
In order to have a safe and orde
rly environment, Thousand Oaks uses an integrated curriculum designed to: 
 

 
Provide appropriate structure and boundaries for students
 

 
Nurture empathy and problem
-
solving skills
 

 
Instill a strong anti
-
violence/anti
-
bullying environment at Thousand Oaks.
 
Positive Behavior Interventions and Support, also known as PBIS, serves as a broad framework for teaching school
-
wide rules and expectations for how 
students should behave in all common areas. This approach guides school
-
wide, classroom, and individual stu
dent interventions, as well as family 
collaboration. It offers a plan for supporting all students in school, including students with additional needs and the few s
tudents who need the most 
intensive supports. A key component of this approach is that behavi
oral expectations are explicitly taught to students, and reinforced throughout the 
school year. In addition PBIS provides supports for students to learn pro
-
social skills, and has consequences when students make negative behavior 
choices. Good behavior is 
recognized and celebrated by teachers, staff, and administrators through 

Golden Leaf Awards

 
and 

Class Leaf Awards

 
which 
are presented to students and classes observed making good decisions and following the rules. 
 
 
The structure provided by through PB
IS is complemented by the Toolbox curriculum, which focus on teaching students empathy, self
-
regulation, and 
problem
-
solving skills. In addition, Thousand Oaks is using the Welcoming Schools curriculum, which focuses on teaching family divers
ity and anti
-
b
ullying 
behavior. Together, these integrated curricula represent a proactive approach to ensuring a safe learning environment for all
 
students by providing 
appropriate support and guidance to help children be successful.
 
 
All students are expected to follo
w the main rules: Be Safe, Be Respectful, Be Responsible, and Be an Ally at all times while at school as well as at any 
school sponsored activities off campus.
 
 
In addition, during lunch, recesses, and before
-
and
-
after school, staff members, administrators
, and noon supervisors supervise students and school 
grounds to ensure an orderly, safe environment. The school is always fully compliant with all rules, laws, and regulations co
ncerning state earthquake 
standards and hazardous materials. Earthquake and fi
re drill are held monthly, and intruder drills are held at least once a year.
 
 
Safety and disaster preparedness procedures, including elements of our Comprehensive Safe School Plan, are reviewed with scho
ol and district staff at 
the start of each school ye
ar.
