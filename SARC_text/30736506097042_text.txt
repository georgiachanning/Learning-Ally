By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Mission/Vision
 
"Bonita Canyon is an inclusive community that fosters risk
-
taking, collaboration, and creativity to c
reate lifelong learners.  
Together, we empower our students to think critically about the world and be compassionate citizens."
 
 
 
At Bonita Canyon Elementary School we strive to enable all students to become contributing members of society 
empowered with t
he skills, knowledge, and values necessary to meet the challenges of a changing world. With a team of 
highly qualified staff, we provide the highest quality educational experience we can envision. Our teachers model and 
encourage intellectual risk
-
taking t
o support students problem solving skills in all content areas.  We were named a 
California Distinguished School in 1989, 2006, and again in 2010.
 
 
Located in the Turtle Rock area of Irvine, the school opened its doors in 1977. The physical layout of the s
chool permits 
teaming and interaction and the playground offers wonderful views of the surrounding areas. We received state 
renovation funds and underwent major renovation during summer 2009.   We again underwent renovation in the summer 
of 2017 as a part 
of the Measure E Bond and are looking forward to our new MPR scheduled to begin construction in the 
Spring of 2020.
 
 
As a neighborhood school, we serve students in our immediate community and those who are here by choice from around 
IUSD. We have a very hi
gh percentage of parents in professional occupations and the community is stable with a low 
mobility rate. Education is a considered a very high priority in our community.
 
 
Parent involvement contributes significantly to our success. Teachers, students and
 
parents work closely together in an 
atmosphere of mutual respect and cooperation. Our students have supportive, caring parents who value education, and 
dedicated, committed teachers who provide continuous high quality instruction for all students. The Par
ent Teacher 
Association (PTA) provides outstanding volunteer and financial support for many school programs. The strong partnership 
between parents and school staff, coupled with our shared commitment to excellence, creates an exceptional learning 
environm
ent that can be seen and felt throughout Bonita Canyon School.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Bonita Canyon School was built in 1977. We received state 
renovation funds and underwent major renovation during 
summer 2009. Our site and grounds are clean and well maintained. In addition to the original buildings, the school has 
eleven portable (re
-
locatable) classrooms. Childcare is offered on site and is hou
sed in two additional re
-
locatables near 
the playground. We have maximized our use of shared areas in the library, computer lab, stage, and auditorium to meet 
the needs of our student population.

Although our school was built before the use of computers w
as commonplace in schools, with help from our generous 
community and PTA, as well as our recent modernization (Measure E Funds 2017), we have altered our infrastructure to 
accommodate 1:1 devices (Tablets and Chromebooks), our library/Innovation Lab/Green 
Screen Lab, and all classrooms 
with state

Through the leadership of a student environment club (L.I.F.E club)  we created a recycled school garden that is used as 
an outdoor education cent
er.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our students show positive 
problem solving skills on the playground and in the classroom. Our Bonita Be's (be respectful, 
be responsible, be safe, be a friend and be your best) are reviewed with students and consistently referred to by both 
teachers and instructional aid staff.  Our
 
campus supervision is based on district allocations and many of our staff members 
have taken specific training in conflict resolution and cooperative discipline. This year we will be working on implementing 
a student council driven anti
-
bullying program t
hat is focused are rewarding those who stop bullying and foster a culture 
of inclusion.
 
 
Bonita Canyon has an extensive plan for emergency procedures. The plan is revised annually and often improved based 
on what we learn from emergency drills. Biannually 
we practice Reunification Drills and Full Disaster Drills where our 
parents check out students as they would during an actual emergency. Our supplies are renewed with assistance from our 
PTA. We participate in district
-
wide emergency drills and many staff 
members are trained in CPR and First Aid.
 
 
We have developed a comprehensive Safe School Plan, which is evaluated yearly and amended, as needed, through our 
School Safety Committee. We are proud to say there are few, if any, reportable crimes at Bonita Can
yon.

districts.  In 
place of more than 40 specific funding categories, the new model has established three sources of state funding with 
increased local discretion to determine how best to spend those funds in the service of students.  All districts receive a 
B
ASE of per
-
student funding that varies slightly depending on grade level.  All districts also receive SUPPLEMENTAL 
funding.  IUSD has used BASE and SUPPLEMENTAL funding to support the following programs:
 
 
Site Programs and Services:  1) Support professiona
l learning and teacher coaching through induction program, content 
TOSAs and teacher mentor program , 2) provide summer school and summer athletic programs, 3) Allocating site funding 
and staffing to support student achievement through support of Professio
nal Learning Communities (PLC) and site PLC 
coaches, 4) Elementary P.E. paraprofessionals, 5) Support for English language learners, 6) Elementary science, music, and 
art programs, 7) Purchase textbooks and instructional materials, 8) Develop a technology 
rich learning environment 
including; Technology matching programs, Technology Maintenance fund and site technology support staff, 9) Maintain 
previously implemented class

Finally, CONCENTRATION grant funding equal to 50 percent of the base is provided to districts in which English
-
learners, 
low
-
income students and 
foster youth exceed 55 percent of the total enrollment.  Irvine Unified School District is not 
eligible for concentration funding because its enrollment does not exceed the 55 percent threshold.

minimum student impact. Official staff development meetings were scheduled as follows:
 
 
2014
-
15  Staff 
Development (a day prior to the start of school, a non
-
student  day in October and a non
-
student day in 
February) was focus on continued implementation of the Common Core, writing instruction as well increased technology 
integration into the classroom for 
both student use and parent communication
 
 
2015
-
16   Our staff development  was concentrating on implementing more technology and using programs like Google 
Classroom to support our students, staff and community.  We also focused on Next Generation Science
 
Standards and 
Thinking Maps  throughout the remainder of our Professional Development.
 
 
2016
-
17  We spent our six staff development sessions working on Professional Learning Communities and an even deeper 
implementation of Google Classroom as a communicat
ion tool for our school.
 
 
2017
-
18  Our six Staff Development Sessions were spent focusing specifically on PLC (Professional Learning Communities) 
common assessment development, PBIS growth and action and reading HEART by Timothy Kanold.
