Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

he 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with 
alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requiremen
ts for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students tested 
includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of students test

is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula

Note: Mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment and the 

number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of stu
dents who met the standard (i.e., 
achieved Level 3
-
Alternate) 
on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

oo small for stat

accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to 
calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who receive
d 
scores.

volunteer in the classrooms working with students a

Team Jaguar Fundraising Committee, School Site Council, and/or our English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) meetings 
to learn more about the school and how they can support it as well as to
 
give their input and suggestions.  The school has 
a variety of activities throughout the school year that parents can participate in.  These include Back to School Night, Open
 
House, parent teacher conferences in November and February/March, our monthly P
AWS assemblies, book fairs, Costume 
Day Parade, Holiday Chorus Programs, APEX Fun Run, Whooo's Reading Program, Read In/Pajama Day, Dance Festival,
