Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Talent Show, Science Fair, 
and Kindergarten and 6th Grade Promotion.  Parents are also invited to attend monthly Principal 
Coffee, Read Across America Day, Back to School Night, Open House and various other special assemblies/events and field 
trips. We offer parenting workshops and 
evening educational events such as Literacy Night, Science Night, and Family 
Math. Parents participate in the governance and support of Bellevue Elementary through service on our School Site 
Council, our Parent Teacher Organization, the English Language Ad
visory Committee, and Local Control and Accountability 
Planning. Parents are also encouraged to volunteer at our school.  Parents can assist in the classrooms and/or accompany 
students on field trips.  At Bellevue Elementary School we value our parent comm
unity and enjoy working together to 
benefit our students.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Ongoing professional development is an important part of improving our school program. The school district and Bellevue 
School provide professional development targeted to raise student performance on the API and AYP. The major 
improvement efforts this yea
r have focused on English Language Development and ELPAC training. Site leadership team 
including teachers and principal have participated in the California Principals Support Network to focus on developing and 
sustaining strong professional learning commu
nities with a collaborative culture. 100% of the teachers at our school have 
engaged in advanced training designed to promote specific skills or information related to these school priorities and 
objectives. Our district also provides individualized coachi
ng through the use of a consulting teacher and release time to 
observe in other classrooms for teachers to receive additional professional development and support in individual areas 
of need. Teachers meet at least weekly in PLCs and collaboration time to 
analyze student data, plan instruction and 
evaluate student learning. Technology is used extensively to disaggregate and analyze student data to guide instruction.
