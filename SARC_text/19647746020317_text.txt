Principal's Message
 
 
Greetings Students, Parents, and Community Stakeholders:
 
 
My name is Trionne
 
Magee and I am the proud principal of Wilson Elementary Elementary. Wilson Elementary School has dedicated and 
talented teachers and staff who are motivated to help all students succeed. This is clearly evident when one looks at the Com
mon 
Assessments sco
res that continue to improve. One of my goals is to support and promote the established foundation of collaboration 
between teachers, and further cultivate the highest degree of education for every student, ensuring continued growth. The tea
chers at 
Wilson
 
will work in collaborative teams to develop effective teaching strategies to ensure that all students are truly grasping the 
critical 
concepts of the Common Core curriculum in every classroom. Rigorous, student
-
centered, hands
-
on instruction which is enha
nced by the 
use of technology and ALD / ELD streamlined strategies within the 50 / 50 instructional approach is also evident in every cla
ssroom in our 
school.
 
 
At Wilson, we believe that the goal of education is to help students develop intellectual abilit
ies and interests, social awareness, personal 
competencies, as well as a code of ethics. Hence, students explore subject matters from a variety of platforms. Our high
-
quality instruction 
guided by the Common Assessments provides a balance between gaining a
 
solid knowledge and learning foundation, exploring a wide 
range of interconnected subjects, and obtaining needed skills for success in middle school, high school, college, and careers
. 
 
 
Expanding beyond just knowledge and facts, we emphasize deeper 
understanding and connections, as well as learning how to learn. As 
students begin to take more responsibility for their own learning, the faculty members remain supportive and nurture personal
 
growth. 
Wilson is a PBIS Silver Medal School where students ar
e mentored and rewarded for positive behaviors. At Wilson, students are taught 
and expected to demonstrate positive behavior expectations such as Respect, Optimism, Achievement, Responsibility, and Safety
. Every 
staff member on campus plays a role in promo
ting Positive behaviors and providing interventions when needed. We provide challenging 
and engaging programs in a nurturing learning environment, devoting care and attention to every student. By embracing high st
andards 
of character, commitment, and achie
vement, Wilson Elementary School encourages students to think critically and creatively and to act 
ethically. 
 
 
We are fortunate to have a strong community at Wilson Elementary School. There are numerous ways for students and parents to 
stay 
involved. I am
 
overwhelmed by the amount of support and pride I see every day from our amazing students, parents and the community. 
I am acutely aware of all the hard work the team has done over the past many years to establish and improve the school enviro
nment 
and am 
so proud to call myself a Wildcat. Wilson Elementary School is, has been, and will continue to be a uniquely exceptional educ
ational 
institution. I am extremely pleased to be a part of this truly special organization as your Principal and leader. I am hono
red and humbled 
to serve the community at Wilson Elementary School. The heart of any school begins and ends with the people who enter it ever
y day, 
from the staff, to the students, and their families. Wilson Elementary School is a vibrant and diverse commu
nity, promoting personal and 
intellectual growth and I will work to build a community where each and every stakeholder is filled with a sense of pride as 
a contributing 
member of Wilson Elementary School.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
 
Trionne Magee, MS Ed.
 
 
Principal, Wils
on Elementary School

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains informa
tion about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they
 
intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requir
ements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

We choose our textbooks from lists that have already been approved by state education officials. For a list of some of the te
xtbooks we use at our school, 
see the Data Almanac that accompanies thi
s report.
 
 
We have also reported additional facts about our textbooks called for by the Williams legislation of 2004. This online report
 
shows whether we had a 
textbook for each student in each core course during the 2013

2014 school year and whether those
 
textbooks covered the California Content Standards.

School Facility Conditions and Planned
 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Wilson Elementary School was built in 1935. After its original construction seven additional classrooms and modular classroom
s have been added. In 
2004, Wilson added a new structure that consists of eight classrooms, teache
r work rooms, library and a computer lab. In 2013, the campus received a 
face
-
lift through painting the entire school, resurfacing the playground and parking lot, and the removal of an old structure.
 
 
In 2013
-
2014, new roofing replacement on buildings were
 
completed. Flooring system repairs and upgrade installed in December 2015. Additional 
flooring system replacement is scheduled for 2016 and 2017. New play structure installation planned for  2016 along soft scap
e play surfaces.
 
 
 
Wilson staff and students
 
pride themselves on having a clean and well maintained campus. The custodial staff at Wilson is comprised of three full time 
custodians who maintain 44 classrooms, two computer labs, library, cafeteria and restrooms. In order to ensure a safe and cle
an ca
mpus, the custodial 

and grounds personnel by sustaining 
a safe and clean campus.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buil
dings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical sys
tems, heating and ventil
ation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good
 
repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those 
repairs. The guidelines for this assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the si

Tool used for the assessment on the Web site 
of the OPSC.

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarte

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible s
tudents 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Invo
lvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents and the community are very important to the educational programs at Wilson Elementary. In addition to daily Parent
-
Teacher relationships, 
parents are involved in school activities by serving on Parent councils such as 
the School Site Council and the English Learner Advisory Council and by 
volunteering on campus and with the Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), in classrooms and at school events. parents are also i
