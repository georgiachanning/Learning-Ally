About the SARC
 
By February 
1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding F
ormula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and l
ocal priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the 
school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Bemis Elementary School, originally constructed in 1966, is currently comprised of 18 permanent classrooms, 9 portable classr
ooms, administrative

School Safety 
 
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Bemis Elementary School. All visitors to the campus must sign in at 

pass at all times. Supervision is provided to ensure the safety of each stude
nt before school, during breaks, at lunch, and after school. Supervision is a 
responsibility shared among parent/guardian volunteers, teachers, and administrators. To further safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, a 
comprehensive School Site Safet
y Plan has been developed by the School Site Council. The Safety Plan was most recently updated in March 2018; any 
revisions and updates are reviewed immediately with the staff. Key elements of the Safety Plan focus on the following: 
 

 
School rules & proced
ures
 

 
Disaster procedures/routine & emergency drills
 

 
Current status of school crime
 

 
Notification to teachers
 

 
Child abuse reporting procedures
 

 
School
-
wide dress code
 

 
Policies related to suspension/expulsion
 

 
Sexual harassment policy
 

 
Safe ingress & 
egress of pupils, parents/guardians, & school employees
 
The school is always in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthqua
ke standards. Safety drills, 
including fire, earthquake, and code yellow ar
e held monthly.
 
 
Cleaning Process 
 
 

dopted cleaning standards 
for all schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are perfor
med on a daily basis throughout the school year with emphasis on classrooms and 
restrooms. A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

staff to develop sanitat
ion schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment. 
 
 
Maintenance & Repair 
 
 

nctions occurring during 
vac
ation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered by Rialto Unified School District to ensure that
 
school grounds and 
facilities remain in excellent repair. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority; repair requests are co
mpleted efficiently and in the order in which 
they are received. 
 
 
Facility Improvements / Deferred Maintenance 
 
 
The district has a five year, Deferred Maintenance Plan designed to address expenditures for major repair or replacement of e

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
