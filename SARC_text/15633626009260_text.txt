Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Buena Vista Elementary is rich in history.  The original school site was established in 1875, and the present school can be 
traced back to the 1914.  Buena Vista derived
 
its name form the early name given to the southern portion of the San 
Joaquin Valley by Pedro Fages.  Mr. Fages named the large lake located between what is now Bakersfield and Taft "Buena 
Vista" (good view) after being impressed by the spectacular view h
e experienced upon entering the valley.  We live up to 
the school motto, "A Tradition of Quality Education."
 
 
In 2002, Buena Vista Elementary School was recognized as a California Distinguished School.  We strive to maintain the 
concept of "Excellence in E
ducation" as defined by the Panama
-
Buena Vista Union School District.  The mission of the 
Panama
-
Buena Vista Union School District is to efficiently and equitably prepare all students for a productive and 
successful citizenship in our society.  Toward that
 
end, the district is committed to a comprehensive core curriculum, 
grounded in cultural literacy, to develop the broad background of fundamental knowledge necessary to promote 
intellectual, ethical, cultural, emotional, and physical growth.
 
 
Buena Vista h
as provided "Excellence in Education" since 1875.  This tradition rests solidly on a professional and caring 
staff, engaged parents, and motivated students working together to achieve state and district standards.  Buena Vista 
teachers are currently review
ing both CAASPP and STAR testing results and using the information acquired to improve and 
drive the instructional program. Adults have high expectations for children in their studies and behavior.  At Buena Vista 
Elementary School, we are dedicated to dev
eloping confident, lifelong learners with the skills and knowledge necessary 
to succeed in the rapidly changing world of the twenty
-
first century.  An effective partnership between home, school, and 
community empower students to become socially responsible
 
citizens who effect positive change in our culturally diverse 
society.  Buena Vista Elementary School will continue to provide a safe and learning focused environment; promote local 
and national service; and embrace the diversity of our community.
 
 
Missio
n Statement:  To Inspire Our Learners to Become Dedicated, Lifelong Leaders.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Buena Vista provides a safe and clean learning environment.  A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the 
District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are maintained to a degree of adequacy that provides for a positive 
learning environment.  Ongoing repairs and modifications to the physical plant exceed California Building and Safety 
Codes.  The Distr
ict's coordinator of Safety and Risk Management verifies quarterly that OSHA requirements are met.  The 
exterior grounds are well lit and the perimeter of the school facility is fenced for student protection and safety.  A team 
of custodians ensures classr
ooms and campus grounds are kept clean and safe.  The restrooms are cleaned, sanitized and 
secured at the end of each school day with 100% of the toilets in operating condition.  Installation of solar panels was the 
most recent improvement to the facility.
  
Grounds and playground equipment are inspected regularly for potential 
hazards. Scheduled certificated supervision of students begins officially at 7:50 a.m. when the school opens and 
supervision ends at 3:10 p.m.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California
 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [
ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State St
andards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univer
sity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

children at home with their school work and providing a caring environment.  Opportunities for parental involvement at

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The school safety plan is reviewed yearly and updated whenever appropriate.  As outlined in our Safe Schools Plan, the 
safety committee has addressed concerns for the safe ingress and egress of students.  Staff members have received 
training in emergency p
rotocols, and several staff members are CPR certified.  Identifying badges are issued to all 
individuals as they register in our school office.  The gates on the perimeter of the school are locked during school hours 
and staff members are trained to activa
te lock
-
down procedures in the event of an emergency.  The School Safety Plan 
was reviewed at our most recent staff meeting on August 21, 2019.  Our positive partnership with local law enforcement 
is evident in their quick response when concerns arise.
 
 
An
 
assessment of the current status of crime is utilized during the review of our campus safety procedures.  An action plan 
and goals are developed to identify strategies and programs to maintain a high level of school safety.  The public is notifie
d 
when a 
safety meeting is held and parent/community input is encouraged.  The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was also 
reviewed by the Buena Vista School Site Council and approved at the meeting held on October 3, 2019.
