By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

instrumental in the construction of the Stin
e Canal.  Later Stine Road was built along the course of the canal and was 
named after the canal.  Stine Elementary School, opened in 1900 and later built at its present site in 1957.  It was named 
for the nearby road. Stine Elementary School, supports and
 

as defined by the Panama
-
Buena Vista Union School District. Our teachers strive to ensure student learning is evident.  
We believe this attitude pays off in student test scores and achievement. 
 
The School Accountability Report Card was 
established by Proposition 98, an initiative passed by California voters in November 1988.  The Report Card, to be issued 
annually by local school boards for each elementary and secondary school in the state, prov
ides for parents and other 
interested people a variety of information about the school, its resources, its successes, and the areas in which 
improvements are needed.
 
 
Stine Elementary School received LCFF and Title 1 fund from the federal government. The T
itle 1 funds strengthened our 
Language Arts and Mathematics Programs, utilizing intervention practices in grades kindergarten through sixth.  Our  LCFF 
funds were used to assist identified English Language Learners, while other monies enhanced the library 
and media 
program.  Money from LCFF fund various programs, projects, and materials and partially fund our Intervention Specialist 
and various instructional aides.
 
 
Stine's purpose statement is, creating an atmosphere of academic, social, and behavioral exc
ellence for all. A standards
-
based curriculum and sound assessment strategies provide the foundation for continuous improvement of student 
performance and school programs.  Students will leave Stine Elementary School with a positive attitude toward learnin
g, 
a strong foundation in basic skills, and the ability to meet future academic challenges.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Stine Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for learning. A scheduled maintenance program is 
administered by the District to ensure that all classrooms and facilitie
s are maintained to a degree of adequacy that 
provides an environment for learning. Ongoing repairs and modifications to the physical site meet California Building and 

y that OSHA requirements are 
met. The exterior grounds are well lit and the perimeter of the school facility is fenced for student protection and safety. 
A team of custodians ensures classrooms and campus grounds are kept clean and safe. The restrooms are 
cleaned, 
sanitized and secured at the end of each school day with 100% of the toilets in operating condition.
 
 
As outlined in our Safe Schools Plan, the safety committee has addressed concerns for the safe coming and going of our 
students. The District pro
vides training in emergency protocols and CPR/First Aid as part of its ongoing staff development 
program. Identification badges are issued to substitute teachers by the district and volunteers/visitors are provided with 
visitor passes as they register in o
ur office. The gates on the perimeter of the school playground remain locked during 
school hours and staff members are trained to activate lock down procedures in the event of an emergency. Our positive 
partnership with local law enforcement is evident in 
their quick response time when concerns arise. Designated staff 
members carefully supervise students on the playground and in the cafeteria. Grounds and playground equipment are 
inspected regularly for potential hazards. Fire and/or disaster drills occur m
onthly and a complete school site disaster plan 
has been prepared and is in place and available for public review. Scheduled certificated supervision of students begins 
officially at 7:20 A.M. when the school opens and supervision ends at 2:45 P.M.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of 
students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Stine School's Comprehensive School Safety Plan was reviewed, revised, updated,, discussed, and adopted by the School 
Site Council on December 7, 2017.  We believe Stine Elementary School has a positive and safe learning environment.  The 
Safe School plan 
has seven goals. There are two goals that are our primary focus:  Goal #1 Assure each student a safe 
physical environment, under the overall leadership and supervision of the principal, staff, students and parents. Goal #2 
Improve the school's culture. Imp
rovement Activities include the following:  Secure campus by enforcing a "closed 
campus" during school hours.  Maintain a log of all visitors and require same to wear identification badges provided at 
check
-
in.  Send reminder letters as necessary to parent
s addressing traffic and other safety concerns, requesting their 
cooperation.  Provide additional supervision of restrooms throughout the day for the safety and privacy of the students.  
Provide safe entry to campus and additional entry point supervision w
ith a daily student valet team.  Continue to 
implement a fair and systematic discipline structure consistent with State and District policies.  Maintain a log of student 
discipline violations.  Continue parent/guardian contact with continual updates of the
ir child's behavior.  Continue talks in 
the classroom and with students about bullying and harassment, and the importance of reporting it.  Continue adult 
supervision of all areas of the school where children are present.  Utilize District and community in
tervention agencies to 
provide support for teachers, parents, students, and the community.  Implement programs like Safe School Ambassadors 
and PBIS. Celebrate and promote incentive and reward programs like VIV, student improvement awards, Viking Valor 
tic
kets, and Viking Strong wristbands.
