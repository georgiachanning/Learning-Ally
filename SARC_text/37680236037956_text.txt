School Description
 
Feaster Charter School is a District Partnership charter school, which offers students, families and 
teachers a unique opportunity to work together to achieve shared goals for student academic and 
personal success.  Our vision is to enrich our students'  l
ives with a rigorous world
-
class education 
with an emphasis on Technology and STEM/ VAPA ideals.  Feaster Charter School is one of 46 
schools in the Chula Vista Elementary School District.
 
 
In 1997 in collaboration with teachers, staff, parents and 
students and with the approval of the 
Chula Vista Elementary School District Board of Education, Feaster became a charter school. Feaster 
Charter School currently serves approximately 1,200 students in transitional kindergarten through 
eighth grade.  We al
so have a state preschool program on our campus. Feaster Charter is a 
neighborhood school; all of our students live within walking distance of the school.
 
 
Vision
 
At Feaster Charter School, students are at the center of all decision making.  We prepare our
 
students to become 21st century learners in a multicultural society by infusing Visual & Performing 
Arts as well as Science, Technology, Social Studies, Engineering & Mathematics into our daily 
curriculum and literacy instruction. This integration challen
ges our students to communicate and 
think critically, creatively and collaboratively.  By introducing the Arts and Sciences we are fostering 
leadership and reasoning skills, as well as increasing self
-
esteem at a young age to make a life 
changing impact.  
The students who leave Feaster Charter School will be lifelong learners who are 
on their way to being college and career ready.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report
 
Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountabilit
y Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE 
LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Condi
tions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Classroom space at Feaster Charter School is adequate to support our school's current enrollment.  The District maintains a p
lanned program that ensures 
routine maintenance functions are performed on a sche
duled basis.  Five custodial staff performs basic cleaning operations daily.  We have a new 
partnership the the YMCA. They provide before and after school student monitoring activities for a large group of students un
der their registered 
program.  Our YMCA
 
Program offers after school activities, tutoring, homework club, and a number of other programs for over 200 students. Our ca
mpus 
has had two major dirt areas upgraded to create an park
-
like feel for teachers, parents and students to use before, during, a
nd after school.  Further this 
helps the diminish dust and allergens that may affect students with asthma.  We added a drainage channel to remove the standi
ng water and reduce 
chances of mosquitos/west nile virus.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not

Feaster Charter School recognizes that it is not enough to improve instruction, curricula, or materials. Success depends on s
upport from parents, 
businesses and community organizations. Thus the Principal and Lead Team identify critica
l support staff.  One such person is the Community Resource 
Director who encourages parents to become school volunteers and partners in learning.   Vehicles for parent and community par
ticipation include Feaster 
Charter Board, English Learners Advisory Com
mittee, and Parent Teacher Organization. An integral part of our governance model is our Charter Board 
which has a majority of Parents as members. This group is further augmented by local business and civic community leaders who
 
oversee the charter. 
This g
roup meets regularly with the principal. We encourage parents to visit and become active in our school.
 
 
Feaster Charter Board
 
There are seven members on the Feaster Charter Board. This body has a large representation of parents and staff members. The 
Engl
ish Learners Advisory 
Committee is a non
-
voting advisory committee to the Feaster Charter Board. Council members take an integral part in monitoring school programs a
nd 
progress. The Council approves the Student Achievement Plan, reviews, monitors the scho
ol budget, implements the charter, and supports the principal 
and the school.
 
 
English Learners Advisory Committee
 
Feaster has an active English Learners Advisory Committee (ELAC). The purpose of the ELAC is to develop a school plan relatin
g to the 
Dual Immersion 
and ELD programs, to conduct a school needs assessment, and to make other parents aware of the importance of regular school a
ttendance.
 
 
Parent Teacher Organization
 
We have a very involved Parent Teacher Organization (PTO). The group has spo
nsored many projects for the benefit and welfare of our children.  These 
include participation in fund raisers, identifying chaperons for field trips, volunteering in classrooms, school festivals, s
upport of our ASB, and much more.
