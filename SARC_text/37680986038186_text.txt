Special Education/ISSSchool Accountability Report Card 
for School Year 2018-2019
Published in 2019-2020
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by 
state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The 

SARC contains information about the condition and performance of 

each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula 

(LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a 

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they 

intend to meet annual school-specific goals for all pupils, with specific 

activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported 

in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported in the SARC. . 
 For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC Web page at 
http://www.cde.

ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF 

Web page at 
http://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 

community members should contact the school principal or the district 

office.
DataQuestDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest Web 
page at http://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional informa
-
tion about this school and comparisons of the school to the district, the 

county, and the state. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that 

provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school 

graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding 

English learners.
Internet AccessInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that 
are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the 

Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-

come, first-served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of 

operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 

on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, 

and the ability to print documents.

A Message from the Principal . . .
Conway School continues its commitment to meet individual student™s needs and to provide a quality educational 
program through a partnership with EL Education (formerly Expeditionary Learning, a nationally recognized, 

research-based, innovative model. Our goal is to foster academic achievement and character growth, while instilling 

a love of learning and sense of community. The Expeditionary Learning model has been credited with producing 

high-performing schools through active learning, character growth, and teamwork. 
We understand the importance of preparing our students for college and a career and are teaching students 21st 
century skills such as collaboration, critical thinking, creativity, and communication. Students are provided rigorous 

instruction through a cross curricular approach that emphasized the relevance and connections between ideas and 

concepts. In fact, Conway teacher work very hard to make academic content standards come alive through long-

term, in-depth investigations called Learning Expeditions.  Each Expedition incorporates the teaching of academic 

skills, while fostering a genuine love of learning.  Learning becomes even more relevant as students are provided 

opportunities to investigate real-work or community issues, collaborate with their peers, develop meaningful solu
-tions, and take positive actions. 
Teachers are provided both the professional respect and the planning time to collaboratively create these rigorous 
Learning Expeditions and are continuously learning about high quality student work, research based instructional 

strategies, and best instructional practices. The ‚whole™ child is a priority at Conway as we attend to our students™ 

social and emotional needs. Students and staff develop positive and supportive relationships through character and 

scholarly expectations for excellence, perseverance, integrity, and compassion, EPIC Actions.  Our goal is to ensure 

that all students feel a sense of belonging and efficacy. 
At Conway School, we are proud of the positive partnership that we have developed with families in our learn
-ing community.  A dedicated focus on student learning and parent involvement is at the center of what we do as an 

organization. High expectations for all students, academic standards, student behavior standards, and parent-teacher 

relations are part of our core EPIC values.  Our caring and dedicated staff maintains a daily commitment to fulfill 

our school mission.Tina Meglich, Principal

(School Year 2019Œ20)
The Conway School Parent Teacher Association is active in supporting the school financially as well as with 
schoolwide activities such as Conway™s Fall Festival, PTA Holiday Workshop, school book fairs, fundraisers, and a 

family dances.  The PTA also generously supports field work and assemblies for Conway students.
We also receive support from many parents who serve as classroom and school volunteers.  Our Family Liaison 
works to involve Conway™s parents through a variety of volunteer activities, parent workshops, and parent ESL 

classes.  She also plays an active role in the English Learner Advisory Council (ELAC), working with the parents 

of English language learners.
Oasis Tutoring has been providing one-on-one tutoring for struggling readers in our primary grades.  The group, 
composed mostly of retirees and senior citizens, is growing.  Each volunteer reads with students once or twice a 

week.  Together these volunteers spend about 450 hours per month in one-on-one tutoring with Conway students.
Our governance body of staff and parents oversees the Single Plan for Student Achievement and the various 
funded programs.  The School Site Council (SSC) approves budgets for these programs. The SSC generally has five 

scheduled meetings throughout the year.
Conway parents represent the school by attending district level meetings such as DAC and DELAC.
Volunteers interested in getting involved to positively impact our school programs are encouraged to call Conway

each site convenes a School Site Council meeting to review school safety policies in relation to board policy, 
administrative regulations and Education Code. Each school reviews and updates its comprehensive school safety 

plan, and the plans are annually presented and approved by the school district Board. The plans are updated 

using current discipline, attendance, health, and curricular data. The Comprehensive Safe School plan includes 

child abuse reporting procedures, disaster response procedures, suspension and expulsion policies, notification
