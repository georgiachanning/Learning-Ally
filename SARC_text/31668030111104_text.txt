Principal's Message
 
Barrett Ranch Elementary School, proud home of the Broncos, is an award
-
winning school (2018 
Exemplary Reading Program from the International Literacy Association, CA Distinguished School 
2012) serving the 
Antelope/Dry Creek community since 2006. 
 
 
At Barrett Ranch we strive to do what is best for all kids at all times. It is our constant focus that 
students at Barrett Ranch learn to be little leaders that grow into big leaders. This can be seen in 
the way w
e teach, and in how we address individual student needs
-
 
academically, socially, and 
emotionally. It is our belief that all students have special talents and skills that should be celebrated 
and a part of our job is to discover those assets in kids. The st
aff at Barrett Ranch believes that all 
students can be successful and gives above and beyond daily to empower our students to believe 
the same about themselves. Staff and students work together to create a culture of kindness, care, 
and respect here at Bar
rett Ranch. Our highly qualified and caring staff explicitly model and teach 
our four school wide expectations: Show Respect, Make Good Decisions, Solve Problems, & Always 
Choose Kind. Students who exhibit these expectations are acknowledged through Kindne
ss 
Ambassador awards and Bucky Badges for behavior. When you walk onto our campus, you 
immediately can feel the excitement that comes with meaningful learning and the nurturing 
climate that supports the needs of every student.
 
 
Parents are an 
integral part of our school community as partners in the education of children. 
Volunteers, or "Ranch Hands", serve to assist teachers and students inside and outside of the 
classroom. Parents also have opportunities to engage in school through participati
on in the School 
Site Council, PTA, Art Docent program, Coffee with the Counselor & Principal monthly meetings, 
ELAC meetings and multiple family events throughout the school year.
 
 
There are so many ways to engage kids in learning and we are honored to wo
rk as a community 
towards that endeavor. Barrett Ranch students, parents and staff possess the ability and drive to 
forge new and innovative programs to develop a balanced and effective education for all students. 
The staff is committed to providing standa
rds
-
based Common Core instruction which is 
differentiated for all students' needs. Extracurricular and enrichment opportunities for school 
include Drama Club, Homework Club, Math Club, Chess Club, Books Clubs, Summer on the Ranch 
(library and lunch program
), Student Leadership and before and after school math/reading 
tutoring. Every grade level has a beautifully designed Reading Lounge that is utilized for quiet 
reading, small group time, and interventions. The Barrett Ranch Reading Lounges are a significan
t 
aspect of our Culture of Literacy here at the Ranch. We are proud to strive daily to spark a fire for 
reading within our students. Our motto is: Broncos Read, Broncos Lead. This motto further drives 
our passion to instill a love of reading within each an
d every Bronco student because Readers 
become Leaders.
 
 
Barrett Ranch is a remarkably special learning community. All hands working hard to offer every 
student the opportunity to be successful. I hope you find this information helpful to you. Please let 
us
 
know how we can help you, or provide more information, by calling our school office at 916

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condit
ion and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annua
l school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the Calif
ornia 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Dry Creek Joint Elementary School District held a P
ublic Hearing on September 19, 2019, and determined that each school within the District has sufficient 
and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the 
State of California. All 
st
udents, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for 
use in the classroom and to take home. In grades 6
-
8 each student receives a textbook available to keep
 
at home and has a class set of textbooks to use 
at school. Online access to textbooks is also an available option for mathematics, English Language Arts/English Language Dev
elopment (ELA/ELD), and 
History Social
-
Science in grades kindergarten through eigh
t. Instructional materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the State Department 
of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are
 
reviewed by all teachers 
and a recom
mendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended mater
ials are 
available for parent examination at each school site, the district office, and in some cases online prior to adoption. The
 
table displays information about 
the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used in the school.

ess: The principal works daily with the custodial staff to ensure that the cleaning of the school is

f these standards are available at the district office for review.    Maintenance and Repair District maintenance staff ensur
es that the repairs necessary 
to keep the school in good repair and work orders are completed in a timely manner. A work order proc
ess is used to ensure efficient service and highest

ystems, interior or 
exterior painting, and floor systems.

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of

lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
