By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The community of Murwood Elementary School 
is committed to providing our students with a challenging, standards

level strategic planning process in December 1996. 
With broad community participation, strategies were 
identified, and vision and mission statements were created. Each year, this planning process is revisited, and areas of focus
 
are deepened or developed. The action steps developed in each area of focus ar
e then implemented in the upcoming 
year.
 
 
The school has a long tradition of parent involvement, as evidenced by countless volunteer hours, participation in site 
governance, strategic planning, and fundraising activities to support uplifting and inspiring 
programs. In addition, there is 
a strong link between the district office and regional and community resources that enrich our school.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 23, 2019
 
 
The state of California requires that each child have a current standards
-
based textbook in each of the four core areas of 
instruction. As a par
t of this requirement, Walnut Creek School District has purchased editions for teaching language arts 
(reading, writing, speaking and listening), science, social science, mathematics and health. We are fortunate to have a 
music text (K
-
5) for our students 
and a music specialist who meets with all of the classes. Our foreign
-
language texts are 
also up
-
to
-
date. Thus, all textbooks in the Walnut Creek School District are current, standards
-
based, and consistent with 
the content and cycles of the Curriculum Fra
meworks and adopted and approved by the State Board of Education.
 
 
We have an abundance of supplementary reading materials at varying levels of difficulty in each of our elementary 
classrooms that are integrated across all core curricular areas. These leve
led reading materials provide students with 
experiences in reading narrative as well as expository text.
 
 
The Walnut Creek School District governing board held a public hearing on September 23, 2019 and affirmed that each 
pupil, including English learners,
 
has his or her own textbook to use in class and to take home.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
School Facilities 
 
 
The Murwood School facility has 16 
classrooms, a library media center, Reading Recovery room, counseling and speech 
rooms, and a large multipurpose room located in the main building. There are seven additional permanent portables on 
the campus which house two classrooms, the learning center
, Educational Options, art room, science room and music 
room. The school was built in 1955 and has been maintained and renovated extensively over the years.

Students work in well
-
lit, heated and cooled classrooms. The entire site is well maintained to pro
vide a positive teaching 
and learning environment. Every classroom has a telephone with access to an outside line, internet access, and a dedicated 
walkie
-
talkie for immediate contact anywhere on campus. All classrooms have also been furnished with a ceili
ng mounted 
LCD projector and a document camera. A newly installed publicaddress system allows for messages to be broadcast both 
inside and outside the buildings simultaneously.
 
 
Regarding safety, Murwood is a closed campus during the school day. After the 
morning bell rings, all gates providing 
access to the school grounds are locked. To facilitate ingress and egress of parent community, volunteers and visitors, a 
three
-
foot path was built outside the perimeter of the fence that runs from the back of the sc
hool to the front. Entrance 
during school hours is only through the front door.
 
 
All staff wear Walnut Creek School District badges daily identifying them as district employees. There is a strong volunteer 
sign
-
in policy in place, along with corresponding 
badges that all visitors must wear. Volunteers are trained annually.
 
 
Students are permitted to be on school ground fifteen minutes before school begins and adult supervision is provided 
during all recess times. Students not collected immediately after dis
missal are supervised until parents can be contacted 
for pick up.
 
 
Murwood has 186 Chromebooks dedicated to second, third, fourth and fifth grades. We also have 75 iPads used primarily 
in our transitional
-
kindergarten through second
-
grade classes, with use
 
also in upper grades.
 
 
The library media center is equipped with 17 iMacs, three computer search stations, printers, a scanner and a mounted 
LCD display projector. To support student reading, our library has a large inventory of leveled reading materials 
that 
teachers use to differentiate reading instruction. In addition to printed materials, the library is equipped with a TV, 
document camera, VCR and videos. The carpet in the library media center was replaced in the summer of 2009.
 
 
The classrooms, common
 
areas and grounds are kept clean and in excellent repair by two full
-
time equivalent (FTE) site 
custodians and district maintenance staff. All TK and Kindergarten classes are cleaned daily. First through fifth grades are 
thoroughly cleaned on alternating 
days.
 
 
All restrooms are cleaned daily. Custodial staff members are on duty from early morning to night every Monday through 
Friday to clean the entire facility.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress 
[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or
 
programs 
of study.

Our active parent 
community plays a vital role in encouraging a positive environment at Murwood. Parents are encouraged 
to volunteer in a variety of programs that support student learning. In addition to volunteering in the classrooms, library 
media center, science lab and 
school level programs, parents serve as active members on the following leadership 
committees: School Site Council (SSC), Parent Teacher Association (PTA), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), 
Community Coordinating Council and the Walnut Creek Educ
ation Foundation.
 
 
Through its various successful fundraising activities, the PTA supports many schoolwide instructional programs, including 
the science program and Soul Shoppe, a character
-
education program. The PTA donates funds to purchase supplies for 
classrooms, books, hardware and software for our library media center, and technology upgrades for our classrooms.
 
 
With the help of parent volunteers, home
-
to
-
school interaction is facilitated by weekly eNews communication and bound 
envelopes containing s

and email to further facilitate two
-
way communication between home and school.

Murwood 

volunteers wear an identification badge. Gates to the school property are locked during school hours.
 
 
All students at Murwood School 
deserve an orderly environment to maximize learning. The staff developed discipline 
guidelines to assist students, staff and parents in managing standards of behavior. All classroom, school, playground and 
cafeteria rules reflect our Murwood motto:
 
 
At Mur
wood, we are people of character.
 

 
We are respectful

All professional growth is determined by both school site and district strategic planning process, which is ongoing 
throughout the school year and culminates with an update in the 
spring of each year. Planning teams include all school 
and community stakeholders, and the work is based on site
-
needs assessments. Input from all school and community 
stakeholders is collected during the planning process and is used to develop the distric
t Local Control and Accountability 
Plan (LCAP).
 
 
For 2019
-
2020, the district focus will be on the implementation of the recently adopted math programs at both the K
-
5 
and 6
-


identifying the implementation of Common Core State Standards for professional growth in the district LCAP, other areas 
for professional development identified in the district LCAP are: Technology Integration, English Language 
Development 
(ELD) instructional strategies and Silicon Valley Mathematics Initiative (SVMI) training.
 
 

identifies goals for 
supporting the district focus, staff members meet by grade level or departments to study student 
assessment data or student behaviors and determine how to improve instruction through research and effective 
pedagogy. Weekly collaboration time is provided fo
r all TK
-
8 teachers. Instructional coaches provide individual student
-
centered coaching cycles and participate in grade
-
level and department meetings to support professional growth.
 
 
Individual teachers and administrators keep their skills current by resea
rching about learning, attending workshops and 
classes and reading on their own. Some examples are attendance at various conferences: Teachers College Reading and 
Writing Project, ISTE, PBL World, SVMI, Middle School Conference, Socratic Seminar, Reading R
ecovery, and technology. 
Teachers attend training sessions in differentiated instruction, special education, Next Generation Science Standards 
(NGSS) and in all core curricular areas. Beginning teachers participate in a two
-
year induction program with a me
ntor who 
is trained through the Contra Costa County Office of Education Teacher Induction Program.
 
 
We continue to provide four days each school year that are dedicated to staff and professional development. The district 
ensures the agendas for these profe
ssional growth days are tied to areas defined by the strategic plan and LCAP.
