School Description
 
Marshall Elementary school utilizes the Advancement 
Via Individual Determination (AVID) college readiness 
system to provide students with a challenging and rigorous curriculum in order to ensure they are college and 
career ready. Aligned with AVID, Marshall utilizes a Science Technology Engineering and Math
 
(STEM) 
curriculum called Project Lead the Way (PLTW). AVID and PLTW align by using similar strategies such as 
problem solving, inquiry, organization, reading, writing, and student collaboration to ensure all students learn 
at high levels. Marshall also ce
lebrates and recognizes staff and students within our Positive Behavior 
Interventions and Support system. We use the acronym P.R.I.D.E. to teach and reinforce what we call 
"scholarly" behaviors. Students are celebrated weekly by teachers who identify stude
nts who are excelling 
socially and academically. We also have quarterly recognition assemblies to recognize students for academic 
progress, P.R.I.D.E., attendance, and other areas of success. Finally, teachers collaborate weekly to identify 
students who ne
ed extra support and work together to provide intervention and enrichment for all students. 
Intervention and enrichment are provided during College Workshop time which is one hour daily. Teachers 
provide differentiated instruction to students during this t
ime based on individual student needs identified 
through grade level common formative assessments.
 
 
Vision: Marshall will be recognized as a model collaborative and accountable community by demonstrating a 
passion for learning and personal growth, preparin
g students for college and career success.
 
 
Mission: Marshall prepares students for college and career readiness by providing a collaborative and 
engaging environment and using strategies that ensure students are successful in a rigorous and innovative 
cur
riculum

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a 
School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Loc
al Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with 
data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about th
e LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or t
he 
district office.

Quality, Curren
cy, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes fo
r all students. The law also 
asks districts to reve
al whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far more meaningful when alon
g with 

ames of the textbooks used 
in our core classes and their dates of publication.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 

 
an
d classrooms have been 
upgraded to meet the demands of the 21st century. Marshall received additional modernization when it converted from a 7
-
8 middle school to a K
-
8 
elementary school. Primary classrooms were retrofitted for bathrooms and water fountains
 
in the classroom. New furniture was purchased to meet the 
needs of K
-
3 population. Continual upgrades to enhance access to technology are an ongoing project with Marshall and the district.
 
 
Marshall has many classrooms, a multipurpose room/cafeteria, two 
gymnasiums, a library and an administration building. The number of classrooms in 
use varies, depending on enrollment and available space.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good 
repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by
 
the district to ensure that all classrooms, restrooms, and facilities are well
-
maintained and in good 
repair. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
During the 2013
-
14 school ye
ar, a major project was completed that moved the main entrance of the school from the west parking lot, to the south 
entrance. This will ensure better security on campus while also providing a better service to visitors.
 
 
Stockton Unified takes great 
efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, we utilize the facility survey 
instrument 
developed by the State of California OPSC. The full report is available upon request.

by the district and the site may be selected to carry

out the procedures of a real disaster. Unscheduled drills keep the site better prepared in the event 
of an actual emergency situation. In the event of a fac

resolving the emergency and safely secure or evacuate the students, based upon the site and district emergency preparedness p
