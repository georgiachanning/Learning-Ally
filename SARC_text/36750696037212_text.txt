About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Cabrillo offers multiple opportunities for parent involvement in the school. We have several committees that work at the scho
ol with the most visible 
being our Parent Teacher Association, PTA. This group supports fund
raising activities as well as welfare activities in our community. They provide 
programs for the school, books for the library, music instruction, and support wherever it is needed. We additionally have re
gular School Site Council and 
ELAC meetings to revi
ew and discuss our categorical programs, our needs and to learn more about our instructional programs at every grade level.  
Cabrillo implements the WatchDog Dads, a nationally recognized program that gets more dads involved in school as parent volun
teers.
 
We have a school 
website that provides parents with resources, a yearly calendar, and frequently asked questions about our school. Opportuniti
es for parents are also 
available at Back
-
to
-
School
-
Night and Open House.  All parent opportunities include trans
lation in Spanish. Additionally, the doors of Cabrillo are open 
for any parent to volunteer in our workroom or in a classroom in any way they feel comfortable. Cabrillo has a family and com
munity engagement team 
that focuses on providing more opportunities
 
to grow and expand our family and community engagement.
 
 
Last year Cabrillo opened the Parent Center on campus. This center provides many different opportunities for parents includin
g ESL and parenting classes. 
Housed in the Parent Center is Cabrillo's Co
mmunity Resource Worker who is there to provide assistance to our families that may need help identifying 
resources and programs. The Community Resource Workers works in conjunction with the district's Healthy Start Program.

The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;

Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The campus of Cabrillo Elementary provides a safe a
nd positive learning environment for all students. The District provides a safety plan developed by 
school representatives. Every September at our first staff meeting, our safety committee reviews the plan with our staff and 
discusses any revisions or 
upda
ted items. Our safety committee modifies the district plan to align procedures and routines for specific site needs. Cabrillo
's safety committee meets 
on a monthly basis making sure that the safety plan is modified and kept current as different needs arise
.  We have a district safety committee 
representative for our school that attends all district safety meetings and keep staff updated and informed on any new inform
ation. The plan is reviewed 
during the year and adjustments are shared after each district s
afety meeting. Specific safety objectives are practiced to mastery each month through 
school
-
side drills and practices. Objectives for drills include student behavior and procedures, attendance, and search and sweep pr
ocedures. Cabrillo is 
a closed campus 
to ensure that all students and staff are safe and secure. All parent volunteers must check in at the office.
 
 
In the past year, Cabrillo has introduced various types of lockdown drills, including ones for active shooter. At the beginni
ng of the school yea
r, all students 
are brought into an assembly where changes or additions of new drills are reviewed and discussed with all students and staff.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The Upland Unified School District believes that high quality, research
-
based professional development is essential to continuous improvement of 
teaching skills and concepts. The District provides or coordinates on
-
going training based on needs identified 
through student performance indicators, 
including results of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, the English Language Proficiency Assessme
nts for California, District 
iReady benchmark assessments, and input from sites regarding s
pecific needs. Professional development is aligned with the District Strategic Plan for 
Student Achievement and Board goals. Teachers, paraprofessionals and administrators participate in workshops, and conferences
 
that allow them to 
grow professionally and
 
provide opportunities for collegial sharing. Regular meetings of teacher leaders in literacy, mathematics, reading interventi
on 
and technology as well as follow
-
up coaching support full implementation of training. Additionally, each school provides time f
or teacher collaboration 
on student achievement data, curriculum development, and review of classroom
-
based performance measures. Examples of workshops and coaching 
implemented as the result of analysis of student achievement include: Effective Teaching St
rategies, Classroom Management, Curriculum Alignment and 
Mapping, English Language Development, AVID, Thinking Maps, Positive Behavior Intervention Support, Social Emotional Learning
, 21st Century 
Classroom Technology, Common Core State Standards, Next Gen
eration Science Standards, Modeling Academic Language, Universal Design for Learning, 
and Parent Engagement. Staff members participate in professional development in all
-
day workshops, after
-
school workshops and meetings, individual 
coaching/mentoring, and
 
off
-
site conferences. The Induction (formerly BTSA) program provides support to new teachers. The Peer Assistance and Review 
Program is available to provide support to teachers in the areas of content knowledge and teaching strategies. Currently, the
 
Dist
rict calendar includes a 
collaboration day schedule each week to allow for on
-
going teacher dialogue and collaboration to meet student needs.
