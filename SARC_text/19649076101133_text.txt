By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

students with the most significant cognitive disabilitie

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Decker is 
fortunate to have outstanding parents and a dedicated community who continually support the school through 
donating time, energy, and funds to benefit our children. We feel that there is a place for everyone who is interested in 
being a part of the Decker 
academic and/or social
-
emotional experience. Our PTA is a driving force in promoting school 
spirit and community pride. They sponsor our art program, assemblies, field trips, and many activities through the year 
that enrich the lives of our students and ou
r families. Our WATCH DOGS (Dads of Great Students) volunteer to serve at 
least one day a year in a variety of school activities as assigned by the school staff.
 
 
Parents have the opportunity to play a critical role in providing the parent perspective and 
input on the school plan through 
School Site School Site Council (SSC), English Language Acquisition Committee (ELAC), and School Advisory Council (SAC). 
Decker parent representatives also serve on District Advisory Committees (DAC) and District English La
nguage Acquisition 
Committee (DELAC). These representatives are essential in providing two way communication between Decker and 
Pomona Unified School District. Monthly Coffee with the Principal and Parent Workshops are other opportunities for 
parents to le
arn what is happening at Decker and to communicate with site leadership.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of the 
students and staff is a primary concern of the Pomona Unified School District and Decker Elementary School. 
A Safe School Plan has been adopted by PUSD, which includes policies on disaster preparedness, student discipline, the 
components of a safe and orde
rly school environment, suspension/expulsion procedures, safety, child abuse reporting 
procedures, student dress codes, and student and staff sexual harassment. All schools in the district are in compliance 
with all laws, rules and regulations pertaining t
o hazardous materials. All buildings within the district are in compliance 
with state earthquake standards. Staff and students participate in monthly drills to be prepared for an emergency or 
disaster. Our discipline policy was created to ensure a safe and
 
orderly environment for students and staff. Decker 
Elementary implements Positive Behavior Intervention Supports (PBIS) framework with a foundation of respect, 
responsibility, and safety.
