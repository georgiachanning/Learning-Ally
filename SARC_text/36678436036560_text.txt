By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Mentone School was built in 1949. The facility consists of fifteen 
permanent classrooms and 15 relocatable classrooms. 
The office complex has room for three secretaries, a health office, conference room, restrooms and the principal's office. 
It also has a multipurpose building that serves as a cafeteria, kitchen, and teac
hers' lounge. Modernization was completed 
in 2005 with the installation of air conditioning and new lighting, refurbished restrooms, new windows and carpeting.
 
 
We also have a baseball field that is maintained by our district and community little league 
and is used extensively by the 
students and the community.
 
 
District and school staff work hard to keep the campus clean and safe. The school's facilities are in good repair, and a 
litter/graffiti
-
free environment is emphasized by students and staff. None 
of the eight emergency needs specified in 
Education Code Section 17592.72 exist.

District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed. The governing board has adopted cleaning stan
dards for all schools in RUSD. A summary of these standards is 
available at the school office, at the District Office, or at www.redlands.k12.ca.us. The principal works daily with the 
custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe
 
school. A work order process is used to ensure 
efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.

includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Mentone Elementary School utilizes data from its California Safe School Assessment and suspension/expulsion reports to 
evaluate the 
current status of school crime. A Safe School Plan is adopted each school year and is reflective of the school's 
safety needs. The key components of Mentone's Safe School Plan include a description of school discipline policies and 
procedures, dress code g
uidelines, suspension and expulsion policies, sexual harassment policies, child abuse reporting 
procedures, dangerous pupil notification, and disaster response procedures.  The Safe School Plan was updated and 
reviewed with staff in October of 2019.  We al
so have a School Safe Plan Committee that involves parents and staff that 
meets three times per year.  School Safety 
-
 
To ensure student safety before school, teachers, campus monitors and 
administrators supervise the school grounds including the bus drop
-
off area, Parent drop off area, cafeteria, and 
playground. During the school day all entrance areas to the school are locked with the exception of the front entrance, 
which is near the administration office and multipurpose room. Signs are posted to indica
te all visitors must report to the 
administration office and may not be on school grounds unless they have a visitor's pass. After school, teachers walk their 
students to the bus loading  and pick off and drop off area. Teachers, campus monitors and admini
stration supervise the 
areas until all students have left the campus for home.

actions on the part of m
any individuals working as one. Because of this cooperation, the staff is able to focus on high 
student expectations, coordinated curriculum development, homework expectations and a positive school climate.

The Redlands Unified School District administration evaluates permanent teachers every other year or every 5 years, 
depending on the evaluation process administered. Probationary teachers are evaluated two consecutive years 
and, if 
made permanent, every other year subsequent to their probationary period. The evaluation process provides the 
opportunity for administrators to assist teachers to improve or enhance their instructional skills and methods. During the 
evaluation proc
ess, teachers are formally observed twice, informally observed as needed, and receive a summary 
evaluation report every year they are evaluated.
 
 
Orientation to the evaluation process is covered in meetings with each teacher to be evaluated prior to Novemb
er 1 of 
each school year. The formal observations follow and a written summary is presented to and reviewed with the teacher 
after each formal observation during the specified time period between September and March. In the formal observation 
summary meeti
ngs, the principal offers suggestions for improvement or recognizes appropriate teaching strategies being 
utilized. Following both observations, a formal meeting to discuss the final evaluation document is held prior to the March 
1 deadline for probationar
y teachers and the May 15 deadline for permanent teachers. The teachers have the option of 
an Alternative Evaluation which begins with an orientation, goal setting and meeting to discuss the plan for the alternative 
evaluation. A minimum of two meetings ar
e held with administration to review the progress toward goals and to address 
needs the teachers may have. Informal observations occur throughout the year and the teacher(s) submit a written 
report/student work to show the results and learning of their alt
ernative evaluation.
 
 
The system of certificated evaluation complies with the requirements of the Education Code. Areas required to be 
addressed by the evaluation system include, but are not limited to the following: suitable learning environment; 
instruct
ional techniques and strategies, achievement of curricular objectives; and pupil progress 
-
 
CSTPs.
 
 
Minimum Days are set aside throughout the school year for the staff and grade levels to meet as a PLC (professional 
Learning Community) to work towards incr
easing student achievement through data analysis and accomplishing school 
wide goals addressing the school's vision.The Teacher on Assignment and Leadership Team work with administration to 
plan the agendas for the PLCs. The certificated staff was trained 
on Thinking Maps , writing strategies, designated ELD, 
and continues to receive demo lessons from our TOA in Math.  Mentone staff also attend District training's for core 
curriculum and safety, as required by Redlands USD.  Professional Development for PBI
S and high impact AVID 
instructional strategies are provided during our weekly PD's and monthly minimum days.  Teachers also attend AVID, 
participate in Rigor and Standards PD,  and PBIS PDs provided by the county.
