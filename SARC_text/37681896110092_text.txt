School Description
 
Lemon Crest School was established in 1991 in Lakeside, California. Lemon Crest Elementary School 
provides a full academic program for 
grades K
-
5 general education students and special education 
students. 
 
 
Lemon Crest Elementary School is dedicated to providing all students with a rigorous curriculum 
with emphasis in the Arts and Sciences in a safe, supportive and disciplined 
environment. We are 
also dedicated to providing for the academic and social emotional needs of all students. Lemon 
Crest has established Professional Learning Communities in order to expand and enhance staff 
development and collaboration. Lemon Crest staff
 
meets for 90 minutes per week in collaborative 
groups to discuss student academic performance and how to ensure each student is receiving the 
instruction they need to be successful. We have implemented research based intervention 
programs to meet the dive
rse needs of our students. English Learners and at
-
risk students in grades 
K
-
5 use Imagine Learning English in class, as well as during designated ELD time. At
-
risk students in 
Kindergarten through 2nd grade are utilizing web
-
based computer programs includ
ing Smarty Ants 
and RAZ Kids in their classrooms. At
-
risk students in grades 3, 4 and 5 are enjoying tremendous 
results using READ 180 and System 44, which are research
-
based curricula designed to increase 
student achievement in reading, written instructio
n, and vocabulary. We also have implemented 
the research
-
based Achieve 3000 software program as additional literacy support for our 2nd 
-
 
5th 
grade students. In addition, all of our at
-
risk students receive intensive small group instruction and 
interventio
n in conjunction with computer assisted learning from their teachers and Intervention 
teachers that push
-
in to their classrooms to provide support. Furthermore, Lemon Crest proudly 
launched a 2
-
way Spanish/English Dual Immersion program in the fall of 2015
. We currently have 
a Kindergarten 
-
 
Third grade Grade Dual Immersion classes, and will add a class each school year 
until we have a complete Kindergarten 
-
 
5th grade program.
 
 
To meet the social emotional needs of our students, we enthusiastically participate in a 
combination of Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) and Responsive Classroom. 
Through PBIS and Responsive Classroom, Lemon Crest will focus on four be
havioral expectations 
that are positively stated and easy to remember. In other words, rather than telling students what 
not to do, we will focus on the preferred behaviors. These expectations will focus on building 
communication and collaboration skills, 
which in turn will strengthen school community as well as 
empathy. Lemon Crest will follow the following expectations: Lemon Crest Lions ROAR 
-
 
Respect, 
On Task, Always Safe, and Responsible, as well as disagreeing appropriately, accepting criticism and 
co
nsequences, and working with others. The students of Lemon Crest School also receive mental 
health services through access to our School Counselor who runs small group instruction for at risk 
students on social skills, conflict resolution and other skills 
necessary for school success. We also 
have an active Student Council.
 
 
Lemon Crest Mission Statement: Lakeside Union School District dedicates itself to providing a 
nurturing and challenging environment that is committed to each individual student's educat
ion 
and development. The Lemon Crest Elementary School mission is to enhance student achievement 
by providing a safe, nurturing environment where children thrive and reach their full potential. We 
accomplish this with our Lemon Crest's Positive Behavioral 
Interventions and Supports (PBIS) 
program. We expect all of our students to ROAR by showing Respect, On Task, Always Respectful, 
and Responsible behavior.

Our vision: 
 
 
1) At Lemon Crest we strive to positively impact student achievement
 
 
2) We will continue to partner with 
our community emphasizing respect, kindness, and responsibility
 
 
3) Our learning community will be literacy rich, technology enhanced, and standards

learning opportunities
 
 
4) We will prepare all our s
tudents for life outside the school day, focusing on the soft skills needed to be globally competent and 
successful.
 
 
Mutual commitment to a quality educational program will ensure the best learning for our students. This agreement is a promis
e that 
school
 
staff, students, and parents will work together for student success. 
 
 
THE SCHOOL PROMISE:

responsibilities to the best o
f our ability:
 

 
We will teach grade level skills and concepts using effective teaching methods.
 

 
We will strive to address the individual needs of all students.
 

 
We will communicate frequently with parents regarding student progress.
 

 
We will provide a 
safe, positive, and healthy learning environment for our students.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data reported 
in the 
SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more informatio
n about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school prin
cipal or the district office.

years. During modernization all walls, roofs, floors, plumbing, and electrical have been updated to reflect current demands, 
including techno
logy 
upgrades. Rest rooms and fire alarms systems were updated, along with heating and cooling systems upgraded to ensure energy e
fficient use. Sites are 
cleaned daily and any graffiti removed immediately by custodial staff. Quarterly Community Safety Meet

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Research shows a high correlation between parent involvement and effective schools. We encourage parents to visit our school 
and become actively 
involved. Parents are offered a variety of opportunities to become partn
ers with us in the education of their children. Parents elect representatives to 
serve on the School Site Council, the English Language Advisory Committee, and PTA. We have a very dedicated group of volunte
ers and are most grateful 
for their long hours and
 
tireless efforts put forth on behalf of our staff to support student achievement. Lemon Crest is a School Smarts participant.
 
School Smarts is a research
-
based program that helps parents help their children succeed in school. The program includes a seven
-
session Parent 
Academy with a comprehensive curriculum that fosters parent engagement in education. It encourages parents to promote a compl
ete, high
-
quality 
education that includes the arts.

School Safety Plan
 
Lemon Crest School has a complete Safety Plan that covers all areas pertinent to our students and staff.  The Lemon Crest Saf
ety Plan is updated and 
reviewed in the fall of every school 
year. Staff members are prepared and qualified in areas of CPR, first aid, conflict resolution, and counseling. The staff 
is knowledgeable and has participated with students in duck and cover, fire, and lockdown drills held regularly. The principa
l, secret
ary, and custodian 
have recently participated in emergency preparation training that has led to additional evacuation drills for other scenarios
 
including gas
-
line rupture 
and fuel
-
truck spill. Through the efforts of all staff and maintenance, our school s
ite is safe and clean and provides adequate environmentally suitable 
spaces for students and staff. Standardized, colored emergency flip charts are posted in each room. The complete Safety Plan 
is on file in the school 
office.  A new safety plan will be co
mpleted by January 30th, 2020.  This report will be more detailed and include new information and safety regulations.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. 

of time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional developmen
t.
 
 
Across the District:
 
 
SCIENCE 

 
 
The primary areas of focus for staff and administrator development have been related to the adoption of the Next Generation S
cience Standards (NGSS) 
and moving teachers and administrators into implementation.  Focus are
as include: 1) Building leadership capacity, 2) Scaling up Professional Learning 
and Support to include all district teachers, 3) Planning instruction aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards, 4) Co
llaborative planning tools for 
instruction, and 5)
 
Addressing supplemental instructional materials.
 
 
Professional development needs were determined via district
-
wide Needs Assessment Surveys, LUSD Core Leadership Team/California Next Generation 
Science Standards Early Implementation Initiative, and feedba
ck data collected via prior professional learning events in the district.
 
 
Professional Learning for the 2018
-
2019 school year will address all levels/cohorts of teachers and administrators in the district through continued 
leadership, pedagogy, and conten
t training.  This will occur primarily through science lesson study for all TK
-
8 teachers of science to include MS ELA 
teachers, an intensive summer institute, district Professional Development days, and a review of publisher materials.
 
 
District Leadershi
p Team and established Teacher Leaders will continue to receive training in the areas of Leadership, Facilitation of Professi
onal Learning 
for their peers, and deepening understanding of NGSS innovations, planning, and pedagogy via the NGSS Early Implement
ation Initiative Program.  

Teacher Leader peers through 
the established lesson study model, Summer Institute opportunities, and dis
trict PD days.
 
Other opportunities for science professional learning include supplemental material/planning work supported by a CA Regional 
Environmental Education 
Community (CREEC) partnership, and instructional material evaluation.

ns and 
feedback) and sustainability.  This support will occur both on site and through district management meetings via the Early I
mplementer Initiative.
 
 
Next Generation Science Standards Teacher Leaders, Expansion Teachers, and administrators are supported via NGSS Early Implem
entation Initiative 
Project Director, on

MATH 

 
 
LUSD focused on mathematics as a professional development goal in response to low performance scores on the CAASPP and to sup
port teachers in the 
Common Core Standards for Mathematics.  At Lemon Crest we have focused on Math Transformations and wor
king with students to represent answers 
in a multitude of ways.
 
 
Professional development in mathematics is delivered in three primary ways:  1) Workshops (after school, on professional grow
th days, and during 
teacher release time), 2) Individual and small
 
group site
-
based coaching/mentoring, and 3) Conference attendance.
 
 
Teachers are supported in refining their mathematics instruction and use of curriculum materials through: 1) Workshops focuse
d on the content and 
pedagogy relevant to the math content the
y teach, vertical progression of content, and the Common Core content and practice standards 2) 
Workshops/guided collaboration focused on unit and lesson design with their curriculum materials (within school and cross
-
school), 3) In
-
class coaching 
both in 
one
-
on
-
one and small groups, and 4) Lesson Study in grade
-
level groups.  Additionally, principals attend all teacher professional learning activities 
and receive additional training from a leadership perspective.
 
 
 
Social/Emotional/Behavioral Support 
-
 
 
So
cial
-
emotional learning and support and behavioral support are focus areas in the 19
-
20 school year.
 
PBIS remains in place at all sites. School Counselors continue the work of supporting the social and emotional needs of stude
nts.   Two Behavior Specialist
s 
and two Behavior Intervention Aides are also available to support students with the most intensive behavioral needs.  Two MTS
S Teachers on Special 
Assignment (TOSAs) were added to support the development of social/emotional/behavioral intervention system
s at four of our Elementary sites.
 
 
Professional Development and Coaching have focused on Conscious Classroom Management strategies.  Conscious Classroom Teachin
g provides teachers 
with professional development and coaching on Tier I and II behavioral stra
tegies.  MTSS TOSAs are also available to coach on classroom management 
strategies and student behavior plans.
 
At Lemon Crest, we have focused on Responsive Classroom , as well as PBiS.  We are building social emotional foundations and 
a positive school cl
imate 
and culture through teaching children to care.
 
 
Leadership 
-
 
 
Lakeside Union School District continues to support principal growth through Professional Development and has deepened our su
pport of teacher leaders 
in the 2019
-
2020 school year. Teacher 
leaders (Facilitators) from each site received training in mentoring and coaching as well as content support in 
mathematics and 21st Century Learning. The Facilitators, in turn, provide on
-
site coaching to their respective staffs.

The California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1, 
2018, regarding how to calculate school
-
level per
-
pupil expenditures that will be 
reported on 2018
-
19 report cards.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
Our expenditures include funds for general education, special education, and specially funded projects but do not include fac
ilities costs or deferred 
maintenance. We receive funding for Title I and Title III programs. Approximately three
-
fourths of our re
venues go toward the salaries of teachers, 
specialists, auxiliary personnel, books, supplies, and equipment.
 
 
To make comparisons possible across schools and districts of varying sizes, we first report our overall spending per student.
 
We base our calculat
ions on 
our average daily attendance (ADA).
 
 

se. Restricted funds, 
however, must be spent for specific purposes set out by legal re
quirements or the donor. Examples include funding for instructional materials, economic 
impact aid, and teacher and principal training funds.

DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional infor
mation about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that pr
ovides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, s
taffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at 
libraries and public locations
 
is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length 
of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation
,
 
and the ability to print 
documents.
