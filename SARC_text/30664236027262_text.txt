Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Mission:
 
Benjamin Franklin Elementary School is a diverse learning community that strives to develop respectful, 
productive, and responsible leaders. Our 21st Century le
arning allows us to
 
 
integrate relevant technology, collaborate, 

expectations for themselves. As a Franklin Scholar, I am a respectful
, responsible, and goal oriented citizen who can 
confidently compromise, critically think, and innovatively problem solve in diverse situations.
 

Student Success: The Benjamin Franklin School community is committed to providing innovat
ive and high quality 
instruction in a safe, positive environment conducive to academic learning and personal growth. To achieve this vision, 
Franklin School is committed to provide: differentiated instruction to ensure that the needs of all students are be
ing 
met; standards based instruction by setting high expectations for all students in a focused standards
-
based 
environment; research driven practices enabling all stakeholders to be lifelong learners seeking new challenges and 
professional growth opportun
ities; and collaboration by encouraging an educational partnership with students, 
teachers, and parents working together to achieve a common goal.
 
Franklin provides a STEAM based learning 
experience which infuses the Engineering Design Process as well as c
oding and music instruction. Support

located on our campus. In addition, those students identified, but not placed in the GATE program have an 
Individualized Learning Pl

Students within these classrooms have an Individualized Education Program designed for their needs by the special 
education support staff and the regular educa
tion teacher. The student to teacher ratio is kept minimal to support 
individualized learning. Educational Specialist Program and Speech Program 

 
Students who have been identified with a 
learning and/or speech disability receive additional small group ins
truction from a qualified, certificated teacher. 
Individualized Education Program Plans are developed in conjunction with the teacher and parent to ensure incremental 
growth monitored and learning goals are achieved. English Language Development Instructio

fifty percent of our 
students are English learners (ELs) whose instructional program is consistently monitored by the classroom teacher. All 
of the staff have obtained CLAD or BCLAD certification, enabling them to provide appropriate instruction to the

success and school connectedness, Franklin provides programs outside the school day. The focus is on strengthening 
students reading, math
 
and social development needs. Students engage in STEAM based clubs including choir, knitting, 
coding book clubs. A YMCA partnership collaborates with the school to provide supplemental activities in the area of 
language arts and math to support the daily 
program. Kindergarten Intervention 

 
students needing additional reading 
and math support are provided with additional small group instruction led by two TOSAs (Teachers on Special 
Assignment). Franklin has a partnership with the North Orange County Commun
ity College School District and their "Kids

sciences, and music. Franklin also partners with the OC Big Brothers/Big Sisters Organization 
bringing valuable 
opportunities to many of our students.

General
 
 
The District takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, 
safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the District 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. Safety 
inspections take place on a quarterly basis at all sites.
 
 
Maintenance and Repa
ir
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep the school maintained and in working order are 
completed in a timely manner. An electronic work order process is used to ensure timely and efficient service. Emergency 
repairs have highe
st priority. A maintenance worker is assigned to the site, and is usually on campus once every week. No 
emergency repair needs exist at this site.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
