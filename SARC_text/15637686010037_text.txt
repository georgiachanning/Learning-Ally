About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Every student, including English Language Learners, at Semitropic School has a complete set of textbooks and instructional ma
terials aligned to the state 
core content standards to be u
sed in the classroom and available to take home to complete required homework assignments. All textbooks are 
inventoried and replaced as needed to insure that every student has the necessary textbooks for all core subjects (Williams A
ct). All textbooks are
 
on the 
current, State Approved Materials list from the State Board of Education (SBE). New materials will continue to be adopted and
 
purchased from State 
Approved Materials lists as they are developed.
 
 
Core materials in all subject areas for all student g
roups include:

There is a student performance data analysis review process that is used to identify specific 
student instructional needs, including all significant 
subgroups. The superintendent/principal, TOSA, School Psychologist, and teachers analyze student data (SBAC, benchmarks, CFAs
, CELDT, CBM, Leveled 
Assessments) to help identify all students for specifi
c intervention programs throughout the school year. These programs include Gateways, Read 
Naturally,  ELD, as well as, intervention and enrichment groups.
 
 
Teams collaborate weekly to review student progress and needs are addressed through the use of stand
ards
-
based district approved materials.
 
 
On September 5, 2016, the Semitropic Elementary School District's board of trustees held a public hearing to certify the exte
nt to which textbooks and 
instructional materials have been provided to students. The boar
d of trustees adopted Resolution No. 1011
-
30 which certifies as required by Education 
Code §60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional materials were provided to all students, including English learners, in the 
district to the extent that each 
pupil has a 
textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient textbooks and instructiona
l materials were 
provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consi
stent with the cycles and content of 
the curriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English/language arts.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
General:  The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effo
rt, the district uses a facility survey 
instrument developed
 
by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of this survey are available at the school offic
e.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are provided w
i
th a clean, safe, and 
functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School Buildings:  This school has 11 classrooms, a library, and an administration building. The main campus was built
 
in 1965. Five portable 
classrooms were added in 1996 and two in 2012.
 
 
Mai
ntenance and Repair:  District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and wor
king order are completed 
in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs ar
e given the highest priority.   In the 2014 
-
 
15 
school year, the LCAP provided for funding to be spent on roof repair, electrical issues, and asphalt repair.  In December of
 
2014, roofs were repaired an 
non
-
essential evaporative coolers were removed from 
roofs.  In the Spring of 2015, the lights in the cafeteria will be repaired/replaced to ensure proper 
lighting in the cafeteria.  In the summer of 2015, the two parking lots were resealed and restriped to repair the asphalt. Th
e 2019 
-
 
20 LCAP provides 
fun
ding to repair hard surface areas and replace broken or outdated furniture.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule:  The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. 
The principal works daily with 
the custodial staff to 
develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:  The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides stat
e matching funds on a 
dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school dist
ricts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this 
includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. 
For the 2018 
-
 
2019
 
school year, 
the district has budgeted $200,000 for the deferred maintenance program.
 
 
Facilities Master Plan: The superintendent and Director of MOT will work with the KCSOS office to create a Facilities Master 
Plan which will provide a 
road map to 
repair work and any new construction that may be needed on our facilities.

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative 
Assessment plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of 
students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they receiv
ed a score or not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

of the many opportunities provided for parent involvement.  Furthermore, 
parents are encouraged to participate in the  English Language Advisory Council, and the School Site Council.  Elected parent
s, support staff, and other 
school personnel participate 
in the School Site Council (SSC) and District English Language Advisory Committee (DELAC). Both the SSC and the DELAC 
meet at least three times a year to review the school plan, monitor its implementation and review student progress toward ach
ieving school
 
plan goals. 
SSC and DELAC also provide input toward the development of the action plan and budget to support its implementation. Annually
, in the spring, the SSC 
is asked to give final approval of the SPSA as required. The school/district plan is a living
 
document and is reviewed at each SSC meeting.

Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The California Education Code (sections 32280
-
32288) outlines the requirements of all schools operating any kindergarten and any grades 1 to 12, 
inclusive, to 
write and develop a school safety plan relevant to the needs and resources of that particular school.
 
 
In 2004, the Legislature and Governor recast and renumbered the Comprehensive School Safety Plan provisions in SB 719 and AB 
115. It is the intent of 
the
 
Legislature in enacting the provisions to support California public schools as they develop their mandated comprehensive safe
ty plans that are the 
result of a systematic planning process, that include strategies aimed at the prevention of, and education a
bout, potential incidents involving crime and 
violence on school campuses.
 
 
The historical requirement of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan was presented in Senate Bill 187, which was approved by th
e Governor and 
chaptered in 1997. This legislation cont
ained a sunset clause that stated that this legislation would remain in effect only until January I, 2000. Senate Bill 
334 was approved and chaptered in 1999 and perpetuated this legislation under the requirement of the initial legislation.
 
 
Comprehensive 
School Safety Plans are required under SB 719 & AB 115 and contains the following elements:
 
 
Assessment of school crime committed on school campuses and at school
-
related functions
 

 
Child abuse reporting procedures
 

 
Disaster procedures
 

 
Suspension and expulsi
on policies
 

 
Procedures to notify teachers of dangerous pupils
 

 
Discrimination and harassment policies
 

 
School wide dress code policies
 

 
Procedures for safe ingress and egress
 

 
Policies enacted to maintain a safe and orderly environment
 

 
Rules and procedures on 
school discipline
 

 
Hate crime reporting procedures
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan will be reviewed and updated by March 1st every year. In July of every year, the school 
will report on the status 
of its school safety plan including a description of i
ts key elements in the annual school accountability report card.

The Semitropic school safety plan covers the procedures to follow in the event of an emergency. The plan is kept in the distr
ict office and safety 
contingencies are reviewed annually 
with staff. The School Safety Plan was revised and approved in December 2019.
 
 
Semitropic staff is implementing Positive Behavior Intervention and Support framework for the 2018
-
19 school year, in addition to implementing Safe 
School Ambassadors in grades 
4 
-
 
8. Currently, there is a character education program in place, but little to no monitoring of the use of this program was 
done. Therefore, character education lessons will be part of the lesson plan monitoring process as evidenced by monthly lesso
n pla
n checks. 
Administration will also observe character education lessons in the classroom as evidenced by walk
-
through observation data.
