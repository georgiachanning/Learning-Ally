Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Year and month in which data were collected:
 
Fall 2016
 
 
Auburn Union Elementary School District held a Public Hearing on September 9, 2015, and determined that each school 
within the district had sufficient and good quality textbooks
, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant 
to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English Language Learners (ELL), are given
 
their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional mat
erials, or both, in core subjects for use in the 
classroom and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the 
California Department of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most curren
t available. Materials 
approved for use by the state are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a 
selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent 
examinat
ion at the district office prior to adoption. The table displays information (as of December 2015) about the 
quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. 
AUSD is piloting new R
eading/Language Arts curriculum during the 2019/20 school year.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which

through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
