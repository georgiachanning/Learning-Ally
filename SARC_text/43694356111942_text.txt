Silver Oak Elementary School, a 2020 recipient of California Distinguished School honors, is a unique 
and exceptional community of learners. Supported by the collaborative efforts of teachers, parents, 
support staff and each other, our students continue to thrive. They are civic
-
minded, deep thinking 
individuals, who care for each other and their own learning. We are proud that they are our future!
 
 
Our AYP percentages have been hovering in the 80th perc
entile.  In 2019  students scored (84%) in 
Math and 88%) in ELA . This number does not begin to reflect the culture and climate that has been 
established leading to this success. Silver Oak is distinctive not only for who we are and what we 
do, but for the
 
way we put it all together. We have never lost sight of our original vision 

 
a strong 
commitment that all students can and will learn in a caring environment.
 
 
As we move forward and examine the way content is delivered to our students, there exists thro
ugh 
an array of exciting technological tools, a tremendous opportunity for a shift in our classrooms 
where students are empowered to navigate their own learning. The result will be an even more 
powerful child
-
centered curriculum utilizing 21st Century teac
hing and learning. Our goal is for our 
students to demonstrate proficiency in the three Rs, but also the four Cs: creativity, critical thinking, 
communication, and collaboration. This is our vision...this is our challenge.
 
 
School Motto:
 
Imagine...Innovate...Instruct...
 
 
School Vision:
 
Our vision is to create dynamic learning environments that enable students to develop a deep 
understanding of core content and can use that knowledge to solve problems, think critically, 
communicate effectiv
ely, and be self
-
reflective about their learning.  We will, therefore, develop 
the intellectual, physical and emotional capacities of each child to the fullest extent possible so that 
each can lead a fulfilling life as a productive citizen in our society.
 
 
School Mission:
 
Students will be supported in thinking creatively and critically, and be able to adapt to change. They 
will develop skills in acquiring, filtering, processing, applying and information to make effective 
decisions and to communicate effecti
vely with others. They will develop self
-
esteem by 
participating in a caring school community which appreciates diversity, tolerance, mutual respect, 
cooperation toward team goals, and a love for learning that will last a lifetime.
 
 
Silver Oak will explore
 
new horizons beyond traditional modes of instruction. Using technology is 
an important tool that will assist students in actively participating in their own learning. Teachers 
guide the learning process, set goals, and evaluate outcomes. Students will be 
responsible co
-
owners of the learning process.
 
 

sense of and take an active part in the world of the 21st century and beyond.

Community & School Pr
ofile
 
Evergreen School District, located in the City of San Jose, is comprised of fifteen elementary schools and three middle schoo
ls. Once a 
small farming city, San Jose became a magnet for suburban newcomers between the 1960s and the 1990s, and is now th
e third largest 
city in California. The city is located in Silicon Valley, at the southern end of the San Francisco Bay Area, and is home to 
more than 973,000 
residents. Silver Oak Elementary School is located at the southern
-

orders. In the 2018
-
19 school year, the 
school served 608 students in grades K
-
6 on a traditional calendar schedule. The school provides a family
-
oriented, nurturing, and safe 
place for students to learn, grow, and develop intellectually. Teachers, staff, 
and administrators continue to act on the principle that 
students come first.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, ever
y school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all lo
cal educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Add
itionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardi
ans and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year
 
2019
-
20)
 
Evergreen School District held a Public Hearing on October 10, 2010, and determined that each school within the district has 
sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of
 
California.
 
 
All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects 
for use in the classroom and to take home. All textbooks and instructional 
materials used within the district must be aligned with the California State 
Content Standards, with final approval by the Board of Trustees. Textbooks and supplementary materials are typically adopted 
according to a cycle 
developed by the California Depar
tment of Education. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the quality, currency, and 
availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. The district does not have a formal textbo
ok adoption 
for Health or for Visual and Performing Arts.
 
 
The California State Board of Education adopted science programs at its November 2018 public meeting.  Evergreen will review 
materials in 2019
-
20 to 
determine next steps.  The California State Boar
d of Education adopted Social Science materials at its November 2017 public meeting aligned to the new 
California Framework.  The California Social Science standards remain unchanged.
 
 
Pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, a 
school district may utilize instructional materials not adopted by the SBE, so long as the 
materials are aligned to state standards and a majority of the participants of any review process conducted by the district a
re classroom teachers who 
are assigned t
o the subject area or grade level of the materials being reviewed.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Silver Oak Elementary School, originally constructed in 1994, is currently comprised of 22 permanent classrooms, 13 portable 
classrooms, a computer 
lab, a library, a cafeteria/multipurpose room, a staf
f lounge, and two playgrounds. Playmats were installed in both the kindergarten and playground Big 
Toy Play areas during the summer of 2009. In the summer of 2010, the G Wing portables received permanent cement foundations. 
The school has 
installed a perma
nent outside overhead structure with tables and benches underneath. The chart displays the results of the most recent facilit
ies 
inspection.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 
Silver Oak Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volu
nteers. The district has adopted cleaning standards for 
all schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the school year with emphasi
s on classrooms and restrooms. 
A joint effort between students and staff he
lps keep the campus clean and litter
-

sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair:
 
 
2018
-
19 School Accountability Report Card for Silver Oak Elementary School

A scheduled maintenance program is
 

occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure th
at school grou
nds and 
facilities remain in excellent repair. A work order process is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. Emerg
ency repairs are given the 
highest priority; repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which they are r
eceived.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
The State School Deferred Maintenance Program provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures 
for major repair or replacement of existing school building compon
ents. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. In the Budget Act of July 2009, the State Legislature provided sch
ool districts with flexibility in 
using the
se funds to meet general fund needs. In an effort to mitigate the effects of declining state revenues, the Evergreen School D
istrict has taken 
advantage of this flexibility. The district will utilize bond funds and other appropriate sources to ensure its f
acilities are clean, safe and in good repair.
