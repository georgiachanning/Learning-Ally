Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School
 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Con
trol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
r
eported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more inform
ation about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members shoul
d contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school is a small rural school nestled up against the ea
stern slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. We have 
approximately 380 students in transitional Kindergarten through 8th grade in attendance. With a faculty of nineteen 
teachers (including one resource teacher), our class sizes generally stay under twenty
-
f
ive students. The school district 
itself is geographically large with coverage including the communities of Janesville and Milford along Highway 395.
 
 
The mission of the Janesville Union Elementary School District is to prepare students to be productive ci
tizens and 
confident authors of their future. We will strive to achieve this by offering academically challenging curriculum, quality 
teaching, and modeling integrity and empathy for others.
 
 
Our students participate in a variety of enrichment, academic, a
nd athletic activities. We have three busy afterschool clubs 

 
gardening club in the fall and spring, band (all school year), and coding club (also all school year). Interested upper grade
 
students may be involved in our Science Bowl team, our Geography Bo
wl team, Lit Jam, and a county
-
wide chess 
tournament held at our school. Kindergarten through 8th grade students are invited to join our cross country team, and 
7th and 8th graders can join our flag football team in the fall. In the winter, we have 7th and
 


-
8 wrestling program. In the 

 
 
The Janesvi
lle School staff provides a safe and productive learning environment for students. Janesville School has an 
active student council that meets each month to discuss student
-
identified school issues.  Parents and guardians are also 
very active at this school
 
through an extensive classroom volunteer program (VIP), our Parent
-
Teacher Organization (PTO), 
and our school site council (SSC).
 
 
Since 2016, we have made great strides in our efforts to bring technology into our classrooms and to teach our students 
how 
to use this new technology. Our school has gigabit Internet access in each classroom, wireless connections available 
across our campus, a fully modern traditional computer lab staffed by an excellent computer technician, and a mobile 
computer lab for each 
pair of grade level classrooms.  We are constantly updating our technology with new equipment to 
improve student learning. Most classrooms have document cameras and ceiling
-
mounting projectors to enhance student 
learning.  We have a full
-
time computer tech
nician who also provides support to our students to help them learn how to 
use our ever
-
changing technology. Our school library is bright, modern, and inviting, and the library is staffed by a 
knowledgeable and dedicated library technician. Classes have ac
cess to the library at least one day per week, and students 
have individual access several times per day.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019

Our school en
courages parent/guardian participation and it is a center of many community activities.  Parents/guardians 
can assist our school by serving on the School Site Council (SSC), our Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), our Local Control 
Accountability Plan (LCAP
) committee, or other committees and organizations.  Our School Site Council meets on the 
second Thursday of each month at 3:00 PM in the school library, and the LCAP committee meets directly after that meeting
