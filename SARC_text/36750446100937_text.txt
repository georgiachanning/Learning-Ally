By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
SCHOOL FACILITIES AND SAFETY
 
Kingston 
Elementary provides a safe, clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance and campus 
supervision. Original facilities were built in 1990; ongoing maintenance and modernization efforts ensure facilities remain 
safe and up to date and 
provide adequate space for students and staff. Throughout the years, portable classrooms have 
been added to accommodate increased growth in enrollment. The campus is comprised of the following:
 
Acreage = 10 acreages
 
Square Footage = 49,690
 
Number of perman
ent classrooms = 14
 
Number of portable classrooms = 20
 
Number of restrooms (student use) = 3 sets
 
Computer Lab = 2
 
Library = 1
 
Cafeteria/Multipurpose Room = 1
 
Health Office = 1
 
Staff Work Room/Lounge = 1
 
 
CAMPUS SUPERVISION
 
Proctors are strategically place
d in various areas of the campus for supervision during morning arrival. During recess, 
teachers are on the playground to monitor student behavior and playground activities. Proctors also provide supervision 
during lunch recess and monitor both cafeteria a
nd playground activities. Lastly, during end of the day dismissal, teachers 
monitor designated areas to ensure students leave campus in a safe and orderly manner.
 
 
CAMPUS MAINTENANCE
 
The custodial staff and district's maintenance department work together t
o ensure playgrounds, classrooms, and campus 
grounds are well
-
maintained and kept safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. The principal and custodians 
communicate daily regarding maintenance issues and special projects; hand
-
held walkie tal
kies enhance two
-
way 
communication efforts and help facilitate an immediate response to emergency situations. One full
-
time day custodian, 
one full
-
time evening custodian, and one half
-
time evening custodian are assigned to Kingston Elementary and work 
clo
sely with the principal for routine maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events. Every morning before school 
begins, the day custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards and other conditions that need attention prior to students 
and staff e
ntering school grounds. The day custodian's daily routine includes stocking and cleaning the bathrooms three 
times a day and cleaning the cafeteria when students have finished breakfast and lunch. The evening custodians clean 
classrooms, desks, restrooms, 
and are responsible for set up and take down of equipment and/or furniture for afternoon 
and evening events.
 
 
Kingston Elementary works closely with the district's Maintenance and Operations department (M&O) for larger projects, 
routine facilities maintena
nce projects, and school inspections. M&O employs a work order process that enables Kingston 
to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Emergency situations are regularly 
resolved in one hour or less.
 
 
The district p
articipates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a 
dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school 
building components. Typically, 
this includes  maintenance program.
 
 
Planned or recently completed facilities improvements:
 
Replaced damaged siding and trim on portables
 
Abate existing flooring in cafe and install new epoxy flooring
 
Build storage room for kitchen
 
Replace lifted 
concrete outside cafeteria
 
Paint interior of multiple classrooms

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for 
statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calc
ulate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

All professional development activities in Hesperia 
Unified School District revolve around the California State Content 
Standards and Frameworks and are research
-
based.
 
 
The Certificated staff builds teaching skills and concepts through participation in ongoing training sponsored by the distric
t 
and school 
site. Each school site identifies and coordinates its own staff development activities based upon individual 
student needs, school site plans, and the district's designated focus areas. Supplemental training involving curriculum, 
teaching strategies, and m
ethodologies in the content areas of reading/language arts and math were provided at site 
request via Coordinator of Staff Development and Academic Coaches/Teacher on Special Assignment.
 
 
Supplemental training topics were selected by the principal, assista
nt principal, and Staff Council. Training programs and 
topics were chosen based upon the school focus and student needs. Results for the CAASPP Tests and district single 
assessments, iReady testing, teacher feedback, and findings from classroom observation
s help identify areas for 
improvement and training programs that will enable teachers to deliver a challenging and rigorous standards
-
based 
education fostering student success and proficiency.
 
 
The district supplements site
-
level professional development t
o follow up and support year
-
round and ongoing programs 
centered on the district's focus areas of reading and math. Supplemental professional development is offered throughout 
the school year on early student release days, during summer vacation, and on we
ekends. Staff development topics and 
focus areas are identified and selected based upon input from the district's Professional Development Committee, 
Principals' Roundtable, and teacher survey results. The Site Leadership Team (SLT) meets twice a month to 
review student 
test results from state and district assessments and review teacher survey needs to guide needed professional 
development. The Principals' Roundtable provides opportunities for school principals to discuss and share training needs 
based upon
 
data analysis and classroom observations from each school site.
