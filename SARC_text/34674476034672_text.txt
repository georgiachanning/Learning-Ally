By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE
 
Earl LeGette School truly provides a unique and powerful educational experience for children from the safety of our 
campus to the warmth of the learning environment to the rigor and breadth of the instructional pro
grams. All aspects of 
our school contribute to providing students with the skills needed to be successful learners. This particular school year is 
one that is focusing on improving the learning of all students using the Common Core State Standards with a f
ocus on 
Math.
 
 
The Common Core State Standards will prepare students to be college and career ready for the 21st century. This school 
year as we delve deeper into math, teachers in grades TK through 6 will be teaching students to use higher level thinking 
skills as they gain a better understanding of numeracy and math conceptual understanding. Additionally, work is being 
done to assist students in writing about math and problem solving steps and how to better communicate their thinking 
around how to solve p
roblems. 
 
 
Critical Literacy continues to focus on students thinking deeper about a story or book, asking questions about what 
students think of characters, story line, and plot, while looking for concepts and themes. Literal understanding is discussed
, 
wh
at they are thinking as they are reading, and what concepts are generated. Students then take the understanding they 
developed and write about it, sharing what he/she is thinking about in various sections of the story. By writing about the 
story, new ideas
 
are generated.
 
 

model how to choose a topic, how to sketch it, and how to write about it. Students are then led to independence in 
their 
writing as they apply those skills that were modeled. If students say it, they can write it. If they can write it, they can r
ead 
it.
 
 
At LeGette School there are 320 Chrome Books with which students in grades 1
-
6 will be administered an online 
assess
ment two times a year (3 for 2nd grade)
---
MAP, Measures of Academic Progress. These will allow teachers to 
understand what students know and what they still need to learn while giving students the practice in using the Chrome 
Books for the online assessmen
ts. Students will be taking state assessments in a similar manner through Smarter Balanced 
Assessments. Sixty
-
eight out of the 280 are used primarily by 6th grade for their ELA program
-
 
Amplify.

Parent support and involvement are our greatest assets 
and continue to be great contributors to the educational success 
of our students. This support is given, recognized, and appreciated in many different ways. Some parents help plan the 
programs and policies, while others serve as classroom volunteers, plan 
family activities or work as art docents. Parents 
also support student success by providing space, time and encouragement for daily homework and by sending a clear 
message that education and regular school attendance are important to the family. 
 
 
The safe
ty of our students is the school's first priority and the behavior policy is strictly enforced. We emphasize 
cooperation as well as respectful and responsible behavior which leads to the safety of all of our LeGette family members. 
All adults visiting the 
campus are required to check in through the school office. The atmosphere of LeGette School allows 
our students to feel comfortable and secure. Additionally, monthly fire drills, bi
-
monthly lock down drills, and quarterly 
earthquake drills are practiced to
 
ensure students are prepared in the case of a real emergency.

Year and 
month in which data were collected:
 
September, 2018
 
 
San Juan Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018 and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipme
nt pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and t
o take home. 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewe
d by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption. The table displays
 
information collected in September 2018 about the quality, currency, and availability of 
the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. If you would like more information 
on the textbooks and instructional materials 
please visit our website: http://www.sanjuan.edu/Page/23485 In July 2009, 
EC Section 60200.7. The State Board of Education has adopted frameworks for ELA/ELD, Math, Science and Social 
Sciences, and has identified an approved list of instructional materials
 
available for adoption. For more information

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
LeGette Elementary School, constructed in 1957, was modernized during the 1997
-
1998 school year. The scope included 
roof/repair or replacement, interior, and exterior painting, windo
w system replacement, energy efficient lighting was 
added, new doors with handicapped accessible hardware, restroom restoration, electrical infrastructure upgrade to 
provide for internet, cable, telephone, new fire, intrusion, and intercom system, througho
ut the school.  Window air
-
conditioning units were added to the classrooms.  Currently, there is sufficient space to house the student population.  
Site custodial staff clean the buildings, along with district support for major/minor repairs.  The district
 
provides gardening 
and landscape services on a regular schedule.  Regular fire/emergency drills are held, and badges are required for all 
visitors and personnel.  In 2006, under the Measure J Bond, a new heating and air conditioning system was installed a
long 
with new gas lines and an Energy Management System. Field repair, driveway resurfacing, and irrigation system retrofit 
continue to be a concern.  In the summer of 2008, the parking lot was redesigned and overlaid including ADA and safe 
route work thro
ugh the Measure J Bond.
 
 
The Board of Education and the Superintendent's policy is to ensure that all students are provided with a safe and well
-
maintained learning environment. The Board approved resolutions in 1998 and 2002 to adequately fund 
maintenance 
activities and preserve the repairs and improvements funded by two facility bond measures. The school buildings, 
classrooms and grounds are safe, clean and functional. An inspection of the facility was conducted in August 2019 and 
determined th
at there were no unsafe conditions that required emergency repairs. District maintenance staff ensures 
that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
computer automated work order process 
is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs and health and 
safety repairs are given the highest priority. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards and custodial staffing 
requirements for all schools in the district. This sch
ool meets the Board's standards for custodial staffing and cleanliness. 
The school's custodians are trained in the proper use of cleaning chemicals and Integrated Pest Management techniques. 
They are managed day to day by the Principal with assistance from
 
the district's maintenance department. The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, with funding allocated for major repair or replacement 
of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, h
eating, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. Annually the district budgets $2 million dollars for deferred 
maintenance activities.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
This school is linked 

a Community Safety Specialist assigned to this school within a geographic zone that includes nearby schools. In addition, 
via a partnership with the Sacra


school. The Deputy Sheriffs are assigned to pat
rol a geographic zone either on the east side of the district or the west side 
of the district. They are assigned specific schools within their assigned zone and respond to this school, or others, as safe
ty 
needs dictate. The two CHPD Police Officers are S
chool Resource Officers (SRO) who work identified schools within the 
City of Citrus Heights and respond as safety needs dictate. The two law enforcement agencies will overlap response when 

 
to critical incidents via the Safe Schools Dispatcher, 
a law enforcement dispatcher or via a direct report from a school staff member, school visitor or other person. This school 
has a school safety team which reviews safety matters that may affect the ca
mpus. Our school safety team meets regularly 
to discuss safety issues, update our site emergency plan, and to take steps to be proactive in preventing various types of 
school
-
related safety issues. Community Safety Specialists and law enforcement provides 
speakers to address students, 
staff and community groups on matters of school safety. Our safety team receives training, when requested, from Safe 
Schools or law enforcement. This school is responsible for updating our Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSS
P) by March 
1st of every year per the Education Code. As part of the update, this school meets at least once per year with a law 
enforcement officer to review the CSSP, has the local fire department review the CSSP and we hold a community meeting 
to review
 
the CSSP. The CSSP must be approved by the School Site Council before being submitted to the district safe 

site specific crisis response
 
procedures and a district standardized emergency flip chart. This school conducts and keeps a 
record of all fire drills, lockdown drills, shelter in place drills and/or earthquake drills up to or in excess of what is re
quired 
by the Education Code.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Cont

Professional development is a key part of the continuous improvement process for educators. The goal of our quality 
professional development is to support the learning of teachers and paraprofessionals to positively impact student 
achievement.  Annually, t
eachers and site administrators participate in professional development in a variety of 
opportunities.  Seventy
-
five minutes per week are dedicated to staff collaboration and training planned by site leadership 
teams. The District also provides a cycle of 
continuous professional development for Administrators through Principal 
Networks as well as Leadership Academies.
 
 
The District provides professional development opportunities for teachers and administrators that support the 
implementation of Common Core 
State Standards in English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and the 
ELA/ELD Framework.  Specific professional development initiatives include: Culturally Responsive Practices, Critical 
Literacy, TK
-
2 Reading, Supporting Independence and
 
Engagement through Reading and Writing, Math to the Core, 
Expository Reading and Writing Course, and ELD Foundations.  District departments, Center for Teacher Support, grant
-

ing opportunities.  Professional 
development opportunities are voluntary for teachers and are provided throughout the year in a variety of formats: during 
the school day, after school, on Saturdays, and during summer and vacation breaks. Many teachers and 
administrators 
also take advantage of opportunities with Sacramento County Office of Education, California Department of Education, 
the college/university programs, state/national education organizations, and private educational institutes.
 
 
What grounds t
he professional development in the district is the District Strategic Plan and the Local Control 
Accountability Plan. Professional Development is further determined using one or more of the following: (a) student 
achievement data, (b) staff survey data, an
d (c) district
-
identified goals.  Professional development addresses the Common 
Core State Standards, teaching strategies, curriculum, assessment, technology, classroom management, safety, and 
leadership. Administrator training accompanies professional dev
elopment in district focus areas, providing 
implementation support for teachers on site.  Content
-
area coaches are available at some schools.  Additional classroom 
support is provided to new and struggling teachers by consulting teachers from the Center fo
r Teacher Support.

Paraprofessionals are encouraged to participate in professional development at the district and site level.  Specifically 
designed training is also offered to non

instructional support staff such as clerical and custodial staff that inc
ludes both 
operational and instructional topics.
