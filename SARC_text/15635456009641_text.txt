By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Mission:
 
Why Do W
e Exist?
 
We are a team dedicated to proving a safe learning environment for student achievement
 
 
How Do We Behave
 
As educational professionals, we are dedicated, humble, and approachable.  We hold ourselves accountable to be focused, 
passionate, empathetic
, and act with integrity.
 
Our teaching staff will be respectful, trustworthy, smart and flexible; they will approach teaching and learning with high 
expectations, patience, and encouragement.
 
We are actively engaged and involved in our community
 
 
What Do W
e Do?
 
We are building a community of life
-
long learners by modeling accountability, offering opportunities with constant 
encouragement, and bringing all students to a place of knowing success.
 
 
To meet this challenge, our school community is actively engag
ed creating a safe environment that teaches academics 
and character development, enhanced by a strong partnership between home and school.  We have developed a strong 
professional learning learning community in order to align and improve our practices in i
mplementing the California 
Common Core State Standards, and the instructional shifts inherent in those documents. During the 2016
-
2017 school 
year, administrative and certificated instructional staff participated in professional development delivered by Th
e Leader 
In Me; ongoing training for new staff and coaching for all staff has been in place. Our professional learning was focused 
on essential components in growing leaders in our community, beginning with our school. Instructional Rounds focused 
on instr
uction and learning of the California Standards
--
particularly regarding the use and development of students' 
academic language. Further, we spent significant time learning about and practicing planning for increased student
-
to
-
student academic conversation
 
around content and increasing the rigor and depth knowledge in what students are 
required to know and be able to demonstrate per their learning.
 
 
The District has engaged in the Continuous Improvement Process with the Kern County Superintendent of Schools
 
to 
address areas of need.  A District Team meets regularly to determine root causes for areas of need within the district and 
then create an action plan for implementation at all school sites.
 
 
Our school builds teams of teachers, students, parents, and c
ommunity members to enhance the academic and social 
emotional learning environment.  These teams include:

1.  School Site Council:  The School Site Council (consisting of school staff, parents, and community members) is a major 
governing body that meets r
egularly to address programs as well as varying components that make up the school.  They 
act as a communication liaison between the community and the school.
 
2.  Parent Teacher Club:  The Parent Teacher Club hosts fundraisers and promotes school programs 
by supplying additional 
funds for teachers and students.
 
3.  Student Assistance Teams:  Student Assistance Teams meet to discuss strategies to help struggling children with 
academics, attendance and/or behavior.
 
4.  District Advisory/Budget Committee:  The
 
District Advisory/Budget Committee, lead by the superintendent, provides 
stakeholder input regarding needs for expenditures.
 
5.  Positive Behavior Intervention System (PBIS) Leadership Teams:  PBIS Leadership Teams work in collaboration with the 
principal
 
to improve school climate by implementing systematic approaches to creating a positive learning environment.
 
6.  Professional Learning Communities:  Professional Learning Communities are formed at each grade level.  A teacher 
leader is appointed to lead t
he PLC.  Our Professional Learning Communities continue to study of the shifts in common 
core instruction and learning with a focus on lesson design for close reading, academic
 
vocabulary development, student 
academic discourse and writing across the curri
culum.  We have implemented trimester benchmark assessments in 
mathematics and English Language Arts.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Kernville Union School District has educated children for over 100 years. Originally built to accommodate 700 
students, today the district serves an enrollme
nt of nearly 900 students. The district Board of Education and employees 
have been working tirelessly to improve the academic achievements of our students. The age of our schools created a 
need to address our facilities.
 
 
With the passing of two general ob
ligation bonds and matching state funds, the district modernized all their schools, made 
health and safety improvements, and replaced outdated infrastructure and portable classrooms.
 
 
Kernville Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for stude
nts, staff, and volunteers. School facilities were 
originally built in 1968 and include the cafeteria, staff lounge, playgrounds, computer lab, library, and 12 classrooms, 
which are all up
-
to
-
date and kept clean and neat. Seven portable classrooms were add
ed starting from 1986 through 1997.
 
 
The chart shows the results of the most recent school facilities inspection, as of May 2018. While reviewing this report, 
please note that even minor discrepancies are reported in the inspection process. The items noted
 
in the table have been 
corrected or are in the process of remediation.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The district has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the
 
school office or at the dis
trict office. The site administration team works with the Maintenance and Operations staff to 
develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school. A team of one custodians ensures classrooms, restrooms, 
and campus grounds are kept clean and safe o
n a daily basis. A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the 
district to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well
-
maintained and provide a suitable learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
Safety concerns are the number one priori
ty of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors are 
proactive and conduct inspections at school sites on a continual basis. A preventive maintenance form is used to report 
necessary repairs to keep the school in good repair and working o
rder are completed in a timely manner. A work order 
process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The district maintains
 
an ongoing and major maintenance account for maintenance and repairs. One perc
ent of total expenditures are held in 
this account.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
incl
udes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. 
Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilitie
s); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

As a result of summative and formative data analysis, opportunities for staff development are provided at both the district 
and individual school sites for administrators, teachers, and classified staff. Staff members are provided these growth 
opportunitie
s: planning Core Instruction and for Response to Instruction/Intervention (RTI) utilizing the Common Core 
State Standards and ongoing formative data collection, developing teaching and learning strategies, and learning 
methodologies for reinforcement of po
sitive behavior. In addition, every Wednesday is a minimum day where teachers 
meet in grade level teams to collaborate as a Professional Learning Community(PLC), including teachers from both Wallace 
Elementary and Kernville Elementary. One Wednesday a mont
h is dedicated to provide teachers the opportunity to 
receive Professional Development. Following these opportunities, teachers are supported by their school site 
administrator providing coaching and feedback regarding their progress. The PLC is expanded t
hrough the accountability 
of Job Embedded Professional Development , through Instructional Rounds presses the teachers to choose a problem of 
practice and strategies toward student achievement. Teachers learn from each other.
 
 
Since 2015, district teachers
 
were involved in professional learning around instructional rounds and included in the rounds 
process to collect data on the implementation of effective practices
--
particularly student to student academic discourse 
levels and depth of knowledge around con
tent. Professional development in the effective implementation of the iReady 
reading program was conducted with 2 initial trainings in 2014
-
15 and 3 additional small group trainings in 2016
-
17. These 
additional small group training focused on using data an
d supplemental resources to increase student performance in 
reading
--
both literature and informational texts. Literacy growth has been the focus of district trainings over the past 3 
years and was selected based upon CAASPP performance data and universal r
eading screening data. The District is working 
with Kern County Superintendent of Schools in the Continuous Improvement Process as the current CDE Dashboard has 
identified three areas of need and the District qualifies for Differentiated Assistance Year 2 
through CDE. The District will 
work with KCSOS in creating and implementing an Action Plan that looks at the problem of practice.
 
 
Teachers are supported during implementation through individual coaching, grade level team collaboration, staff 
meetings and 
monitoring and discussion of student data during weekly PLCs.
 
 
The Continuous.Improvement Team, including staff from all sites and administration, work together to determine next 
steps in academic and behavioral training needs for staff.  For the 2019
-
2020
 
school year, the Distirct is working with Polly 
Bath to provide teachers with training and coaching on how to change difficult behavior at school.  This included 5
-
days 
of training in the summer of 2019 and onsite training for each school site throughout 
the school year.  Additionally, the 
District is working with Marzano Company to provide training for all teachers and for teacher leads in administering quality 
assessments and using the data from those assessments to make instructional decisions.
