School Description
 
LeyVa Middle School, a California Gold Ribbon School, is a school with a rich and diverse history 
with a focus on the future.  Since the doors 
opened in 1973, LeyVa has stood for excellence in 
academics and athletics.
 
 
Our mission is to have each students will be inspired to reach their full academic and social 
potential. We will use the strengths of each individual to build an inclusive and coll
aborative school 
campus for students, parents, and staff.
 
 
No longer can we measure aptitude by the amount of facts we remember, but instead we do so by 
the students' ability to use information to communicate, collaborate, problem
-
solve, and 
contribute new
 
ideas or creations. By teaching 21st Century Skills through a culture that empowers, 
technology that enables, and curriculum that engages, we will enhance learning.  LeyVa Middle 
School proudly offers parents and students two instructional choices.
 
 
Bulld
og Tech is a one of the instructional choices for LeyVa Middle School students. This innovative 
program starts and ends the same time as the rest of the campus, but the class schedule is very 
different in order to put into practice the unique curriculum an
d school model. Learning at Bulldog 
Tech is project
-
based and features a co
-
taught, integrated block schedule with 1:1 technology use. 
Bulldog Tech classrooms are on the far east side of the campus.
 
 
Bulldog Pathways is our traditional comprehensive model. Bulldog Pathways is a six
-
period, core 
subject model where every student completes math, language arts, history, science, physical 
education, and an elective. For the electives, students choose pathw
ays that take learning deeper 
in areas like fine arts, music, computer science, STEM, and more.
 
 
Regardless of the instructional model, we promise to give your child the most engaging and 
excellent education 

 
an education to serve him or her in the 21st C
entury where we all must 
communicate effectively, think critically, collaborate, and be creative problem solvers.
 
 
Clubs, sports, leadership and and extensive elective choices have something for everyone.  This 
includes our championship athletic program co
nsists of cross county, basketball, volleyball, soccer, 
and track. Our teams are well known throughout the county for their excellence. When you enter 
our gym, the banners and awards speak for themselves.
 
 
Evergreen School District, located in the City of 
San Jose, is comprised of fifteen elementary schools 
and three middle schools. Once a small farming city, San Jose became a magnet for suburban 
newcomers between the 1960s and the 1990s and is now the third largest city in California. The 
city is located i
n Silicon Valley at the southern end of the San Francisco Bay Area and is home to 
nearly one million residents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Evergreen School District held a Public 
Hearing on October 10, 2010, and determined that each school within the district has sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California.
 
 
All students, including English Lear
ners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects 
for use in the classroom and to take home. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the district must be aligned
 
with the Ca
lifornia State 
Content Standards, with final approval by the Board of Trustees. Textbooks and supplementary materials are typically adopted 
according to a cycle 
developed by the California Department of Education. The table displays information collected i
n September 2018 about the quality, currency, and 
availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. The district does not have a formal textbook adoption
 
for Health or for Visual and Performing Arts.
 
 
The
 
California State Board of Education adopted science programs at its November 2018 public meeting.  Evergreen will review mate
rials in 2019
-
20 to 
determine next steps.  The California State Board of Education adopted Social Science materials at its Novembe
r 2017 public meeting aligned to the new 
California Framework.  The California Social Science standards remain unchanged.
 
 
Pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, a school district may utilize instructional materials not adopted b
y the SBE, so long as the 
materials are aligned to state standards and a majority of the participants of any review process conduct
ed by the district are classroom teachers who 
are assigned to the subject area or grade level of the materials being reviewed.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
LeyVa Middle School, originally constructed in 1973, is currently comprised of 36 permanent classrooms, nine portable 

rooms, a computer lab, the Bulldog Cafe (local kitchen)a library, a staff lounge, and a gymnasium.
 
 
In 2009, the school began major renovation projects as a result of the facilities bond measure that was passed in 2006. 
These renovations include 
expansion of a new parking lot and reconfiguration and modernization of five portable buildings at an estimated cost of $1 mi
llion. Additionally, the 
school opened a new 9,000 square foot administrative building at an estimated co
st of $4.4 million. This building became operational the 2011
-
12 school 
year. For the 2012
-
13 school year, we welcomed a new program with a new facility. Appropriately called Bulldog Tech, this state
-
of
-
the
-
art building has 
double
-
sized classrooms for shar
ed teaching and learning experiences. This addition brings us 7,680 square feet of classroom space at a cost of 
approximately $3 million. A new nutrition center opened in December 2012. This food preparation and serving facility brings 2
,240 square feet at
 
a cost 
of $2.7 million. Currently, the gymnasium is undergoing renovation and upgrades.  All these exciting projects are paid for wi
th local bond funds. The chart 
displays the results of the most recent facilities inspection.
 
 
During the 2018
-
19 school ye
ar, upgrades took place in our gymnasium. The additional of a new HVAC systems, additional of a new multi
-
use room for 
physical education and athletic programs, bathroom upgrades, new scoreboards, and many other aesthetic upgrades.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 
LeyVa
 
Middle School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district has adopted cleaning st
andards for all schools 
in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the school year with 
emphasis on classrooms and restrooms. A joint 
effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and function
al learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair:
 

ns occurring during 
vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program
 
is administered by the district to ensure that school grounds and facilities remain in 
excellent repair. A work order process is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. Emergency repairs are give
n the highest priority; repair 
requests are
 
completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
The State School Deferred Maintenance Program provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures 
for maj
or repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air con
ditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. In the Budget Act of July 2009, the State Legislat
ure provided school districts with flexibility in 
using these funds to meet general fund needs. In an effort to mitigate the effects of declining state revenues, the Evergreen
 
School District has taken 
advantage of this flexibility. The district will utili
ze bond funds and other appropriate sources to ensure its facilities are clean, safe and in good repair.

lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Staff members build teaching skills and concepts through participation in conferences and workshops throughout the year. The 
Evergreen School District 
has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad
-
based variety of p
rofessional growth opportunities in 
curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies. Common Core State Standards are currently taking priority across the dist
rict, however each school 
focuses his or her professional development on what is specifically n
eeded at their site. Teachers are involved in preparation and planning for language 
arts and math to develop strategies and acquire resources which align with the new standards. Site in
-
services here at LeyVa consist of such topics as 
equity in the classro
om, culturally responsive teaching and learning, 21st Century Learning, building an inclusive and positive school climate/cul
ture, 
developing and using PLCs, teaming across curricular areas, discipline, PBIS, Restorative Practices, and Special populations 
(SPED, EL, economically 
disadvantaged youth) including GLAD (Guided Language Acquisition Devices).
 
 
Additionally, administrators provide observation, feedback, and data to teachers based on best practices as these items perta
ins to Common Core. As a 
whole,
 
the administrative team provides professional development to all teachers with regard to the transition and implementation of
 
Common Core 
State Standards. Site level experts also assist in this area by leading departments in collaboration, setting norms, 
analyzing data and supporting best 
instructional practices.
