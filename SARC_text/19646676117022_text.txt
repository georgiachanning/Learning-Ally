School Description
 
The Leadership Academy has a unique role in the district. The Community Day School staff works 
closely with students and their families, other district schools, and the School Attendance Review 
Board (SARB) to serve those who will benefit from a Community 
Day School environment.
 
 
The Leadership Academy is a school where curriculum is delivered to promote student 
achievement, motivation, and responsibility. The cognitive, social, and emotional strengths of each 
student are the beginning point for instruction
 
that is based on current research and practice. 
Students are expected to internalize a vision of success and apply what they have learned at The 
Leadership Academy to their education as it continues beyond the Community Day School setting.
 
 
The Leadership
 
Academy expects all students to meet local and state academic standards and to 
understand the relationship of school achievement to life goals. The Leadership Academy students 
are expected to behave in ways that reflect a growing understanding of themselv
es and their 
responsibility to family, school and community.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
General
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the Los Angele
s County Office of Education. The results of this survey are available at the school office or at the district office.
 
 
School Buildings
 

nent classrooms.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that e
mergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is 
available at the district office. 
The Supervisor of
 
Operations works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
Although the State no longer requires a Deferred Maintenance contribution, Lancaster School District is still dedicated to ma
intaining the facilities for 
our students.  These expenditures would include but not be limited to roofing, plumbing, heating, air 
conditioning, electrical, painting, and flooring.  For 
the 2019
-
20 school year, the district has budgeted $940,000 for deferred maintenance projects.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Projects
 
We recently renovated an area adjacent to the cafeteria providing 5 new All
 
Gender restrooms for student use.  We renovated the portable restroom in 
2019.  A new flag pole was installed in 2019.  A marque will be added in the latter half of the school year.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

standard (i.e., achieved Level 3
