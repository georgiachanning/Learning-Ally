About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The m
ain fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes for all
 
students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This info
rmation is far more meaningful when along with 

mes of the textbooks used 
in our core classes and their dates of publication.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., Calif
ornia Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California Stat
e University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Our school recognizes that parents 
and the community play an important role in the success and education of their students. Kennedy has established 
partnerships with community businesses and organizations to increase parent participation. The school offers several opportun
ities and programs
 
to 
encourage parent involvement. After School Programs: The Step
-
Up Program is in full swing from the first day of school to the last day of school. Students 
are tutored with the assistance of the program supervisors. They are fed healthy snacks and parti
cipate in exercise daily. Students enjoy activities that 
relate to school as well as opportunities to sing, dance, create, and play cooperatively. Working together the SSC and ELPIC 
parent committees of Kennedy 
School advise the principal about the instruc
tional programs, resources, and ways to offer the absolute best for their children. The School Site Council 
reviews and develops the School Plan for Student Achievement as well as oversees the school budget. Kennedy teachers stay in 
close contact with pare
nts 

m Specialist, and teachers, 
hold CARE Team meetings to provide student interventions and Student Success Team conferences for a
ll students who are at risk for retention and/or 
need additional behavioral or educational support. Students who are identified as having difficulties in the classroom, irreg
ular attendance, behavior and 
academic struggles may also meet with this team alon
gside their classroom teachers to identify strategies and solutions that will diminish obstacles to 
student success. In addition, parents are welcome to volunteer in the classroom, help with student supervision, and participa
te in family and student 
events
. Monthly Parent Coffee Hours are the first Friday of each month and the Child Abuse Prevention Council (CAPC) also has paren
ting classes every 
two weeks on Tuesday mornings for interested parents. Kennedy School also hosts the SUSD Parent Academies parent
s that are seeking effective ways 
to help their child be successful in class.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Oth
er local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 

ures the school facilities 
are in compliance with all federal and sta
te health and safety regulations. Each year a deep cleaning process occurs during the close of school, either 
during the summer or other extended breaks. In the event of a facility plant emergency, the principal notifies appropriate si
te and district perso
nnel to 
resolve the emergency and safely secure or evacuate the students, based upon the site and district emergency preparedness pla
ns. This year parents will 
also be given the opportunity to review the REMS plan at our monthly Parent Coffee Hour in Janua
ry. A site review with the district Internal Evaluation 
Instrument (IEI) occurs annually. A comprehensive Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools document helps to provide a 
safe environment 

s procedures to follow during emergencies and natural disasters. Emergency drills are 
conducted on a monthly basis. This plan was updated in December 2015 and reviewed by the faculty at the August 2016 and Janua
ry 2017 staff meeting. 
Kennedy staff members 
are also being trained on Share 911 at their staff meeting in October 2016 to ensure effective communication in the event of 
an 
emergency. The principal is certified in the national REMS guidelines and procedures. Every effort is made to ensure students
 
ar
e monitored while on 
campus throughout the school day. Yard supervisors, teachers, site administrators, the Campus Security Assistant and school s
taff provide supervision 
for students before, during, and after school. The playground is safe for all student
s. All visitors must sign in at the office, receive proper authorization 
to be on campus, and must display their Visitor Badge or Volunteer Identification at all times. There is a crossing guard in 
front of the school and on the 
corner of El Dorado and Pon
ce de Leon so that students can walk safely to and from home. Parents are not allowed to drop off students in the staff 
parking lot due to safety concerns. Outside gates are to remain locked during school hours thus requiring visitors to enter a
nd sign
-
in 
through the front 
office.
 
 
In an effort to improve safety, John F. Kennedy School is partnering with the City of Stockton and the SAFE Moves program to 
improve safety for students 
on the way to and from school. Parents, teachers, and students learn about t
he real and perceived dangers in the community and then are given an 
opportunity to problem solve with the City of Stockton to increase the safety of students. Finally, Kennedy School is one of 
2 elementary schools in SUSD 
that was selected to participate 
in Project Prevent, a grant from the U.S. Department of Education. Project Prevent is school wide and focuses on reducing 
the cycle of violence and address trauma in the lives of students. The effectiveness of the grant will be measured by the Hea
lthy Kids
 
Survey, discipline 
data, and the number of students receiving mental health services.
