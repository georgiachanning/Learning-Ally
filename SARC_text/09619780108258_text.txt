By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The mission of Lakeview Elementary is to inspire all students to be passionate, continuous learners and to prepare them 
with the skills to achieve their goals and flourish as responsible, caring citizens in a global community.
 
 
Lakeview Ele
mentary School received the California Distinguished School Award in 2018.  Our beautiful school sits atop a 
hill in the midst of a newly developed subdivision overlooking views of the surrounding hills, attractive neighborhoods, 
and Folsom Reservoir. The 
campus was opened in August 2005 and is one of seven schools in Rescue Union School District. 
Located 28 miles east of Sacramento in the foothills of the Sierra Mountains, Lakeview serves a student body of 
approximately 570 students in grades Transitional 
Kindergarten through fifth grade. The enrollment continues to grow as 
our reputation for offering excellence in education travels throughout the community, prompting new families to relocate 
to nearby neighborhoods. Lakeview is a place where our school mot

taking place each and every day.
 
 
Lakeview Elementary School prides itself on a positive school climate and a commitment t o ensuring success for all 
students. Social Emotional Learning is a priorit
y for our school and our District.  The curriculum is challenging and 
encompasses varied teaching strategies to best meet the needs of all learners. The curriculum and instruction are 
differentiated for both gifted students and those students with special 
needs. Under the guidance of dedicated staff 
members, students acquire high levels of knowledge, skills, and understanding that will open doors of opportunity and 
prepare them for thought and action in the wider world. Each student is known as a person and
 
a learner who experiences 
the joys and challenges education brings. Further, we strive to ensure all children develop the skills, attitudes, and 
behaviors necessary to become principled, ethical citizens who are contributing members of society.
 
 
Twenty
-
se
ven teachers work to support our wonderful Lakeview student body, alongside two secretaries, one librarian, 
three custodians, two nurses, two part
-
time counselors, one school psychologist, two Special Education teachers, 14 
instructional aides, one speech/
language pathologist and one principal.  Our librarian is available eight hours a day, each 
school day. A District nurse is on campus one day each week, while our site nurse assists with medical and health related 
issues daily.  Our psychologist is on site
 
two days each week. Our counselors serve Lakeview students three days each 
week.  Our speech/language pathologist offers services to students five days per week. Our Special Education teachers 
are on site daily with seven full
-
time aides to serve those st
udents with identified learning disabilities. Our support 
program serves students, using both the pull
-
out and push
-
in models to meet their individual needs in the least restrictive 
environment. Our all
-
day kindergarten program offers one two hour aide for
 
each class.  Our Learning Intervention 
Program provides three specialized instructional aides to support those in need of intervention.  Our English Learner aide 
supports EL students three days each week, as well.
 
 
Leadership opportunities are provided to
 
all 4th and 5th grade students through our IMPACT student government 
program.  Currently, 70 students learn and practice leadership skills while working on interest
-
based service teams.  Our 
school is engaged in year two of the Positive Behavior Support I
ntervention (PBIS) training and planning.  This process of 
refining procedures and expectations will further enhance our positive learning environment.  The Student Success Team 
(SST) approach is utilized to evaluate assistance to children needing addition
al support. The Student Success Team, which 
consists of the parents, teachers, counselor, psychologist, nurse, teachers, and administrator, meets as needed to develop 
educational assistance plans for children who have been referred by their teacher or pare
nts.

Important to each staff member at Lakeview School, is the climate we create through warm, positive, and uplifting 
interactions on a daily basis. We have established operating principles that serve as foundation for our attitudes and 
behavior. We believe ha
ppy teachers (and staff) foster happy children. Programs are in place to recognize positive choices 
and reinforce our expectations for appropriate behavior. A discipline program is in place that emphasizes the importance 
of learning from our mistakes and t
aking responsibility for our actions.
 
 

environment.  Our Safety Committee (a sub
-
committee of School Site Council) meets to offer input for 
our annual Safe 
School Plan updates.  Safety information is shared and input is requested from our parent community, SSC and PTO.

For the safety of our students, monthly drills are conducted to practice safe evacuations, duck and cover procedures and 
lock
down procedures.  The El Dorado Hills Fire Department assists with some drills.  An emergency preparedness plan is 
in effect. Campus supervision is provided according to policies established by the District Board of Trustees. All efforts to
 
ensure building
 
safety, cleanliness, and adequacy have been successful.
 
 
Students in fifth grade serve as Safety Patrol Officers. They accompany adult staff members in monitoring the campus for 
safety before and after school.

trustworthiness, fairness, and good citizenship. Teachers work to promote the monthly character trait and teach students 
how to e
xhibit positive behavior.
 
 
The three personal standards, Show Respect, Make Good Decisions and Solve Problems are taught to all students.  Eagle 
Manners are taught and encouraged, as well.  A school
-
wide quiet signal is practiced daily and used for safety 
and 
procedures. Grade level expectations assemblies (SOAR assemblies) are held throughout the year, where students are 
also recognized for positive behavior.  Anti
-
bullying lessons, as well as social
-
emotional lessons are delivered to all classes 
by our co
unselors.
 
 
Year 2 of Positive Behavioral Intervention Support (PBIS) is being implemented this year to further enhance student 
understanding and staff consistency of our school procedures and expectations.
 
 
Our 4th and 5th grade student leadership group, I
MPACT, works to provide school service and community service, while

All Rescue schools receive equal allocations, per student, of LCFF Base Funding.  This funding helps support students by 
providing instructional materials, supplies and other needs.  Funding for support services, such as maintenance of 
buildings 
and grounds, utilities, and student transportation, is budgeted for at the district level and provided to each school site 
based on the varying needs of the individual school.
 
 
In addition to the Base Funding described above, schools in the Rescu
e Union School District receive Supplemental funding 
roughly proportional to the number of unduplicated pupils (English Learners, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged, and 
Foster/Homeless Youth) they serve.  Furthermore, school sites receive allocations from ot
her state and federal categorical 
programs, including Title I and Title II.  The purpose of these categorical programs range from improving the quality of the 
total instructional program for all students to addressing the unique needs of special groups of 
students.
