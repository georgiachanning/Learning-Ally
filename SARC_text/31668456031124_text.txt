School Description
 
 

 
Franklin School is a 
family
-
oriented school where the enthusiasm, support, and involvement of 
teachers and parents inspire Franklin students to do their best. Teachers spend countless hours 
designing learning experiences that are academically challenging to help students succe
ssfully 
achieve Common Core Standards.
 
 
In addition to core academic subjects, students at Franklin partake in primary music, instrumental 
music, and choral music programs.  Students in grades 1 through 8 also receive Spanish instruction 
each week.  
With the support of an active PTC, Franklin students also participate in enrichment 
activities, such as Drama, Starstruck, Art Docent, Leadership, and Garden Docent. At Franklin 
School, we strive to promote successful learning in a safe and caring environm
ent through the 
Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support (PBIS) program and school culture building 
programs.
 
 
Franklin Elementary School, in partnership with the community, will continue to work to empower 
every student to become a life
-
long learner 
who is a responsible, productive, and engaged citizen 
within the community.
 
 
Franklin Mission Statement:
 
The mission of Franklin Elementary School is to provide a safe and supportive environment in which 
students can develop socially, emotionally, and inte
llectually whereby they become responsible 
citizens who contribute positively to the world around them.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of 
each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formul
a (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local 
priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the 
school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 5, 2019 and determined that each school wi
thin the district had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of Californ
ia. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual stan
dards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the 
textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers
 
and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended
 
materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. The table displays information collected in Septem
ber, 2019 about the quality, 
currency, and availability of the standards

[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards,
 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
