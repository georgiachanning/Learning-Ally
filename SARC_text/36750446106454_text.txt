By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE
 
As principal, I have the unique privilege of i
ntroducing you to the Annual School Accountability Report Card for Lime Street 
Elementary School. Whether student, parent, staff, or community member, the data contained within these pages will 
prove useful in informing you about our school and community, 
including but not limited to: demographics, achievements, 
progress evaluation, ongoing goal realization, discipline, budget, and facility enhancement.
 
 
In accordance with Proposition 98, every school in California is required to issue an annual School Acco
untability Report 
Card. However, we view this as not only a means of complying with state legislature, but as an opportunity to keep our 
community, and the public in general, well informed. We desire to keep the lines of communication open and welcome 
any 
suggestions, comments, or questions you may have. It is the opinion of the district, myself in particular that a well
-
informed public is vital in continuing to advance in an ever
-
evolving world.

WILLIAMS' VISIT FINDINGS
 
Visit Date: September 4, 2019
 
 
On an annual basis, the San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools conducts 
Williams visits to monitored school 
sites to evaluate sufficiency of instructional materials and to ensure that school site facilities are in good repair. Below 
are 
the findings from the most recent visit including information regarding any remedial action
 
taken or planned.
 
 
The following extreme deficiencies were observed:
 
None.
 
 
The following good repair deficiencies were observed:
 
Section 9. Sinks/Fountains
 
 
Lunch Area: Sink/fountain is leaking (work order #180
-

Section 14. 
Playground/School Grounds
 
 
Grounds: Overgrown vegetation poses a trip/safety hazard (work order #180
-
21
-
17)
 
 
CAMPUS SUPERVISION
 
One proctor in the morning and one proctor in the afternoon supervise the crosswalks and help students safely cross the 
street b
efore and after school. Each morning, proctors supervise the playgrounds and monitor students as they supervise 
activities. Supervision during recess and lunch periods is shared by proctors and school administrators. At the end of the 
day, teachers, procto
rs, and school administrators escort students to designated student
-
pickup areas, buses, and 
crosswalks to ensure students leave campus safely. All adults providing supervision before school, during recesses, and 
after school carry hand
-
held radios to coor
dinate routine and emergency communications.
 
 
CAMPUS MAINTENANCE
 
The custodial staff and district's maintenance department work together to ensure playgrounds, classrooms, and campus 
grounds are well
-
maintained and kept safe and functioning for students, s
taff, and visitors. Administration and custodians 
communicate daily using e
-
mail, a "communications clipboard", and verbally, regarding school maintenance issues and 
special projects. Hand
-
held walkie talkies enhance two
-
way communication efforts and help 
facilitate an immediate 
response to emergency situations.

One full
-
time day custodian and two full
-
time evening custodians are assigned to Lime Street Elementary and work closely 
with the principal for routine maintenance, daily custodial duties, and spec
ial events. Every morning, before school our 
custodian inspects the campus for safety hazards and other conditions that need attention prior to students and staff 
entering school grounds. The day custodian checks the restrooms frequently throughout the day
 
as a proactive measure 
in keeping facilities stocked, safe, and sanitary. The evening custodians clean restrooms, and are responsible for set up 
and take down of equipment and/or furniture for afternoon and evening events.
 
 
Lime Street Elementary works cl
osely with the district's Maintenance and Operations department (M&O) for larger 
projects, routine facilities maintenance projects, and school inspections. M&O employs a work order process that enables 
Lime Street Elementary to communicate unscheduled main
tenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Emergency 
situations are regularly resolved in one hour or less.  The most recent School Facility Repair Status was conducted on July 
24, 2019.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the 
test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

encourages parents, guardians, and other members of the community to share their time, knowledge and 
abilities with our students.  Community volunteers in our school enrich the educational program and strengthen our 
schools' relationships with homes, busin
esses, public agencies, and private institutions.  By their presence in the 
classrooms and on school grounds, volunteers may also enhance the supervision of students and contribute to school 
safety (BP1240).  We have a Parent/Community Liaison that works w
ith various parent groups to provide opportunities 
for involvement and personal growth.  Parents who want more information on school activities or committees may contact

As we transition to new state standards, it is imperative to assist educators to develop a deeper understanding of learning 
and apply it to their classroom 
practices using research
-
based effective instructional strategies.  HUSD has developed and 
is refining an instructional design model to prepare teachers for the shifts required of new state standards.  Approaching 
professional development with intellectual
 
rigor and discipline, implemented with quality and attention to detail, will 
result in improved teaching skills and student performance.
 
 
The Certificated staff builds teaching skills and concepts through participation in ongoing training sponsored by the
 
district 
and school site. During the each school year each school site identifies and coordinates its own staff development activities
 
based upon individual student needs, school site plans, and the districts designated focus areas. Supplemental training 
involving Professional Learning Communities, curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies in the content areas of 
reading/language arts and math were provided at site request via Coordinator of Staff Development and Academic 
Coaches.
 
 
Supplemental tr
aining topics were selected by the principal, assistant principal, and Staff Council. Training programs and 
topics were chosen based upon the school focus and student needs. Results from our Program Improvement County walk
-
through, California Standardized 
Tests and district single assessments, teacher feedback, and findings from classroom 
observations help identify areas for improvement and training programs that will enable teachers to deliver a challenging 
and rigorous standards
-
based education fostering 
student success and proficiency.  The implementation of Common Core 
State Standards and focus on the 4Cs (Collaboration, Creativity, Communication and Critical Thinking), plays a significant 
part of all staff development.

round and ongoing programs 
centered on the district's focus areas of reading and math. Supplemental professional development is offered throughout 
the school year on early student release days, duri
ng summer vacation, and on weekends. Staff development topics and 
focus areas are identified and selected based upon input from the district's Professional Development Committee, 
Principals' Roundtable, and teacher survey results. Our Innovate Ed committee
 
is working through the process of cycles 
of inquiry in which we identify, refine, and provide support for our identified area of focus. The Principals' Roundtable 
provides opportunities for school principals to discuss and share training needs based upon 
data analysis and classroom 
observations from each school site.
 
 
New teachers receive intensive support and training through the district's Induction Program and New Teachers Academy. 
For beginning and out

building through formative assessment and individualized support based on assessment. The New
 
Teachers' Academy 
sponsors three new teacher orientations each year to support year
