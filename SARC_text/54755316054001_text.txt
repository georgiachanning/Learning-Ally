About the SARC
 
By February
 
1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). Th
e SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding 
Formula (LCFF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and 
local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

For additional information about the school
, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or the district office.

Wilson Elementary takes great efforts to ensure a safe, clean and functional physical environment for students, staff and vol
unteers. 
 
Sufficient space is 
provided for students and staff to support teaching and learn
ing.
 
 
Classrooms are inspected daily to make sure they are up to date and repairs are made 
in a timely manner. Monthly meetings are held with district personnel to discuss any repairs or new projects on our campus.
 
 
This summer, Wilson Elementary had a new 
gate installed by the front office to ensure student safety at all times during school hours.
 
 
All visitors are 
required to check into the office and wear a visitors badge while on campus.
 
 
 
The day custodian, assisted by night custodian, cleans all classro

[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are

the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Our Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) framework is based on principles of appl
ied behavior analysis and the prevention approach and 
values of positive behavior support. The integration of our Character Counts lessons which promote six ethical values via the
 
pillars of Trustworthiness, 
Respect, Responsibility, Fairness, Caring, and C
itizenship focus on teaching students to do the RIGHT thing.
 
 
Our school safety plan is annually updated with the input of parents, classified, and certificated personnel. The safety plan
 
is then approved by our School 
Site Council. The plan is shared at
 
a staff meeting with certificated and classified staff. 
 
We routinely review playground safety rules with students, 
certificated, and classified staff. We hold fire and earthquake, and lock down drills regularly. We screen volunteers through
 
our district 
volunteer policy. 
Once they have been cleared, they must sign in and out in the office. 
 
All visitors must report to the office and sign in and out and are required to wear a 
visitors identification badges.
 
 
The school's disaster preparedness plan includ
es steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. 
 
Emergency preparedness drills are 
conducted regularly and the school staff is appropriately trained.
