E
merson Elementary School is an amazing school. Our staff is dedicated to the success of all 
students and children thrive under our care. Our highly trained teachers work collaboratively to 
provide a challenging, engaging, and equitabl
e learning environment for all students and are skilled 
at bringing out the best in everyone. In addition to our core program of reading, writing, 
mathematics, science and social studies, we also provide art, music, physical education, and 
gardening. Stude
nts in all grade levels go on field trips throughout the Bay Area culminating in a 
science based overnight field trip for our fifth graders. All students in grades three, four, and five 
have personal chrome books to use throughout the year. Students use th
eir chrome books to 
practice keyboarding, create stories, essays and reports, practice and enrich their language arts and 
math skills with programs such as Reflex Math, Khan Academy, ZEARN, Flocabulary, NewsELA, and 
RAZ Kids. All students in the school hav
e access to listening to books online with our Tales2Go 
program and we provide extra support for reading and comprehension skills on RAZ Kids and math 
fluency skills in grades 3
-
5 through the online use of REFLEX math. Students have access to all of 
these 
programs at home through our Emerson Library Website.
 
 
We build community at our monthly All School Meeting by recognizing children for their unique 
personalities and skills and by celebrating our talents and accomplishments through student 
performances in
cluding songs, dances, poetry, spoken word, instrumental pieces, jump rope 
rhymes, skits, etc. We practice a positive approach to student development, guiding students as 
they learn to: "Be Safe, Be Respectful, Be Responsible and Be an Ally." Our fifth gra
ders contribute 
to the community by engaging in school service projects, such as tutoring in lower grade classrooms 
and helping throughout the school.
 
 
Emerson has many systems in place to support and enrich our students. Our outstanding 
intervention, tuto
ring, and after school programs provide additional enrichment and support 
activities to over half the student population. Our intervention teachers and BUILD tutors work with 
students individually and in small groups to provide extra instruction in reading
, writing, and math. 
With this level of expertise and support, students do not fall through the cracks at Emerson School. 
Kids' World, our on site after school program, provides homework support as well as a broad range 
of classes and activities to keep st
udent engaged in the afternoons. Our PTA and Kids' World staff 
work together to coordinate opportunities for students to play and compete on our soccer, 
basketball, and football teams, exercise their creative talents in art and drama, and learn new 
talents
 
in comic book designing, Spanish and Lego classes.
 
 
Finally, we have an enthusiastic parent community whose members volunteer many hours working 
in classrooms, at events, and on special projects. We are a truly unique community, committed to 
working and learning together the Emerson Way.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Williams legislation calls for the schools to have enough books in core classes for all students and
 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are 
presenting information outlined in the California content standards.  Textbook materials are adopted by the school board foll
owing a rotating adoption 
cycle for subject specific state adopted textbooks and 
instructional materials.

School Facility Conditions and Planned
 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district administers a scheduled maintenance program to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well maintained and
 
in good repair. A work 
order process alerts district personnel of any maintenance needed to be pe
rformed and ensures that emergencies are given the highest priority.
 
 
Safety issues are the top priority for Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors inspect school sites cont
inually and complete repairs 
in a timely manner. They use a w
ork order process to ensure an efficient, prioritized repair process. The district maintenance staff has indicated that 
100% of all toilets on school grounds are in working order.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts fro
m our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction.
 
 

he information reflects the condition of our buildings as of 
the date of the report. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

O
pportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents/caregivers support Emerson School in countless ways. Many parents help by working directly with students both during 
the school day and after 
school by chaperoning on field trips and by he
lping during specialty classes such as cooking, gardening, library and art.  Families help each other at 
Emerson by  providing meals, carpooling and coordinating support as needed.  Some family members volunteer by maintaining our
 
weekly Bear Facts 
newslet
ter and Emerson website, coordinating and working at special events such as our Walk
-
a
-
thon and Silent Auction and by participating in the PTA 
and assuming leadership positions.  Parents/caregivers also stay involved as members of our SSC (School Site Coun
cil) and ELAC (English Language 
Advisory Committee). Parents and caregivers also focus their talents on fundraising for the school, and due to their multitud
e of talents and perseverance, 
raise enough funds to support for additional Art and PE classes for 
students.  They also support our school by writing mini
-
grants to support classrooms, 
part
-
time bilingual office assistance to our teachers and field trips and special events, such as our Family Art Night.  Our Offic
e of Family Engagement and 
Equity provid
es parent/caregiver support and interaction that contribute to a wonderful partnership between home and school, benefiting th
e children 
at Emerson Elementary. To get involved, please contact our Office of Family Engagement and Equity Specialist Lily Howell
 
at (510) 295

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates
;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is very important to us at Emerson. A variety of people visit the campus to volunteer in the
 
classroom and participate in 
sch
ool events; all visitors must sign in at our office upon their arrival. During lunch, recesses, and after school, staff membe
rs, administrators, and yard 
staff supervise students and school grounds to ensure an orderly, safe environment. The school is alwa
ys fully compliant with all rules, laws, and 
regulations concerning state earthquake standards and hazardous materials. Earthquake and fire drills are held monthly, and i
ntruder drills are held 
twice a year.
 
 
Safety procedures, including elements of our Co
mprehensive Safe School Plan, are reviewed with school and district staff at the start of each school year. 
The plan was last updated and reviewed with school staff in Fall of the 2019
