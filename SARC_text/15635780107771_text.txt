By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Sequoia Elementary School provides a safe, clean 
environment for students, staff and volunteers. School facilities were 
built in 2004
-
2005 with additions built in the 2006
-
07 and 2008
-
2009 school year. They include a multi
-
purpose room, 
library, gym, two staff rooms, the office and 22 permanent classroom
s. The facility strongly supports teaching and learning 
through its ample classroom and playground space.   In the past 10 years a total of 17 portable classrooms have been 
added to the campus to support enrollment growth and to reduce class sizes.
 
 
Cleani
ng Process and Schedule
 
The District has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the District. A summary of these standards is available at the
 
school office or at the District office. The site administration team works with the custodial staff to de
velop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school. A team of four full
-
time custodians ensures classrooms, restrooms and 
campus grounds are kept clean and safe on a daily basis. A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the District 
to en
sure that all classrooms and facilities are well maintained and provide a suitable learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors and site 
administra
tors are proactive and conduct inspections at school sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the 
school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient 
service and that emerg
ency repairs are given the highest priority. The District maintenance staff has indicated that 100% 
of all toilets  and sinks on school grounds are in working order.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The District contributes to the deferred maintenance fund (Fu
nd 14) to cover annual maintenance costs that occur 
through
-
out the year or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting and flo
or systems.  These maintenance costs are 
typically for major repairs.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Sequoia 
Elementary School. All visitors must check in at the school 
office, which is the only entrance to the school (single point entry), and receive a visitor's pass to be permitted on campus
.
 
 
This year our school began using the Raptor Visitor Management Syste
m, which is a district wide initiative being observed 
at all schools within the Richland School District to strengthen our program of campus safety for students and faculty. Part 
of keeping students and faculty safe is knowing who is in our buildings at al
l times, and the Raptor system will allow us to 
do that. The Raptor system will better allow us to screen visitors, contractors, and volunteers in our schools and provide 
us with a safer environment for our students and staff.
 
 
Upon entering a 
district building, visitors will be asked to present an ID such as a Driver's License, which can either be 
scanned or manually entered into the system. If a parent or guardian for any reason does not have a US government
-
issued ID, the school staff member 
can use any form of identification and manually enter the person's name into the 
Raptor system. The Raptor system will check to ensure that registered sexual offenders are not entering our school 
campuses without our knowledge. The Raptor system checks the
 
visitor's name and date of birth for comparison with a 
national database of registered sex offenders. The registered sex offender database is the only official database checked 
by the Raptor system. No other data from the ID is gathered or recorded and th
e information is not shared with any 
outside agency. Once entry is approved, Raptor will issue a badge that identifies the visitor, the date, and the purpose of 
his/her visit. A visitor's badge will not be necessary for those who visit our schools simply t
o drop off an item in the office 
or pick up paperwork.
 
 
The safety of our students is our highest priority and the Raptor Visitor Management System allows us to quickly identify 
those that may present a danger to our students.
 
 
The school is in compliance 
with all laws, rules and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and State earthquake 

Fire drills are conducted on a monthly ba
sis, school intruder drills are held at least quarterly, and earthquake drills are 
held once a school year. When available, Shafter police department is invited to conduct the intruder drill to offer advice, 
suggestions and feedback. Bus evacuation safety 
drills are also conducted throughout the school year. Safety Kits are 
placed in all classrooms and throughout school facilities to provide proper supplies during an emergency situation. 
Monitoring of school grounds is performed by teachers, administrators,
 
custodians and yard supervisors before, during 
and after school.
 
 
A Comprehensive Safety Plan was developed by the school in consultation with local law enforcement in order to comply 
with Senate Bill 187 of 1997. The plan provides students and staff a me
ans to ensure a safe and orderly learning 
environment. Components of the Comprehensive Safety Plan include child abuse reporting procedures, teacher 
notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe ingress and e
gress from 
school, sexual harassment policy, policy to provide a safe and orderly environment conducive to learning, rules and 
procedures on school discipline, a step
-
by
-
step guide to disaster procedures, and dress code policy. Sequoia Elementary 
School re
views and updates the plan annually.
 
 
The plan is reviewed with school staff at the beginning of each school year and was last reviewed in August 2018.  This 
plan is also shared with school site council on a yearly basis. An updated copy of the plan is ava
ilable to the public at the 
school office or the District office.
