School Description
 
Belief: Every student can learn
 
Vision: Every student is prepared for success in college, career, and community
 
Mission: Every student will 
engage in rigorous, relevant, standards
-
based instruction in every 
classroom every day to ensure student learning
 
Core Values: Character, leadership, innovation, continuous improvement
 
 
Polk Elementary, named for President James K. Polk, is themed on Calif
ornia history and the 
Westward Movement. The school is a K
-
6 elementary school situated on twenty acres in a Fresno 
County rural area that is rapidly transitioning to a suburban setting. Polk Elementary was founded 
on August 11, 2004, with an enrollment of
 
360. Currently, Polk's enrollment is 795 students, with 
68.9% low income (June 2019 Data).
 
 
Professional Learning Communities (PLC):
 
A Professional Learning Community (PLC) is educators committed to working collaboratively in 
ongoing processes of 
collective inquiry and action research to achieve better results for the 
students they serve. Polk's professional learning communities, focus on learning rather than 
teaching, work collaboratively, and hold themselves accountable for results through the co
nnection 
of data, evidence, thinking critically, and transitioning that information into practice. Each grade 
level, TK
-
6, uses the following five critical questions (including the use of Common Core State 
Standards and for grades 3
-
6, SBAC data related to
 
students meeting or exceeding standards and 
how students performed within the individual claims), to guide their PLCs for the sole purpose of 
improving student learning:
 
 
What is it we expect students to learn?
 
How will we know when they have 
learned it?
 
How will the student know when they have learned it?
 
How will we respond when they do not learn?
 
How will we respond when they already know it?
 
 
 
James K. Polk Elementary is unique as the first Fresno County school to be themed on California 
hi
story and the Westward Movement. We emphasize the courage and bravery of the early pioneers 
who settled the West and hope to transmit these values to our students.
 
 
Polk uses a variety of progress indicators. Fountas and Pinnell assessments are used to obt
ain a 
reading level for all students in grades TK
-
2, three to four times per year, as well as students in 
grades 3
-
6 who have been identified as reading below grade level as a form of diagnoses and 
progress monitoring. Accelerated Reader's STAR test is giv
en four times annually to check for 
growth. Intervention students are progress monitored during the year using Acadience and Fountas 
and Pinnell. In addition, the district performance tasks are given multiple times annually and results 
are reviewed and use
d to guide instruction.

The integration of technology throughout all content area instruction and the use of adaptive curriculum is evident at Polk E
lementary 
School. Polk Elementary is proud to utilize The Mind Institute's ST Math Program, now in its ten
th year of implementation. Polk uses the 
ST Math software programs before, during, and after the regular school day. Polk also serves 80 students in the Camp Polk Aft
er School 
Program. Exemplary programs in the after school program include ST Math, the Lex
ia Reading Program, Accelerated Reader and extra
-
curricular activities. Additional technologically based programs in use at Polk are Brain Pop, Freckle, and Lexia (used to su
pport students 
with a before
-
school support opportunity as well as throughout the 
school day).
 
 
Polk has been a recipient of the Bonner Virtues and Character Education Award in 2006, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018. Polk 
has been 
recognized as a Gold Level PBIS model school in 2014 and 2015, 2016,2017, 2018 in Fresno County, and was rec
ognized at the state level 
as a Silver Level PBIS school in 2019. Polk has also been recognized for achieving a silver level school for the Superintende
nt's Model Arts 
award through Fresno County Office of Education, as well as being named as an Honor Roll
 
school in 2019 by California Business for 
Education Excellence. These programs help foster problem
-
solving abilities in our students and lay the foundation for active citizenship in 
the future. The needs of identified Gifted students are addressed in indi
vidual classrooms and through a pull out program. In grades 2 
through 6 identified students are clustered together in one classroom with students who are on or below grade level. Every at
tempt is 
made to balance the classrooms so that one class does not re
ceive all of the GATE students and all of the high achieving non
-
GATE 
identified students. We have placed GATE students with teachers who are or have participated in the District sponsored GATE c
ertification 
program. Eligible migrant students at James K. P
olk Elementary are evaluated annually with a migrant "Needs Assessment". If they are 
determined to be Priority for Service (PFS), then the migrant liaison and the classroom teacher complete a migrant Student Le
arning Plan 
(SLP), with recommended interventi
ons and alternative supports for the migrant PFS student.
 
 
Students with special needs participate in the Learning Center Model.  In this model, support is provided through both push
-
in and pull
-
out in the areas of need the student qualifies for on his or 
her IEP. Weekly core test support, accommodations for district performance

opening, art, recess, lunch, and PE. The higher
-
performing students, who are scheduled to take the CAA for the statewide assessment, 
are mainstreamed during co

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, A
vailability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Central Unified Schools maintain current and standards
-
aligned instructional materials in good repair, for all students. Materials are locally adopted and 
reflect programs currently
 
approved by the State Board of Education (SBE). All materials currently adopted reflect the most recent SBE adoptions and 
support the current California Frameworks. Every student, including English Learners, Special Education, and other special po
pulation
s have their own 
textbook. In the case of class sets, those sets augment individual texts that have been issued to individual students. These 
class sets are made based on 
a commitment of the district administration and the governing board and are not the p
roduct of any state requirement.
 
 
All instructional materials are subject to a school and district review process. Materials may be piloted and all materials t
hat are selected and 
recommended for local adoption are reviewed by teachers, administrators, and
 
any parents who wish to review the materials. The Central Unified Board 
of Trustees reviews and adopts based on the recommendation of the district adoption committees and Educational Services.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessme
nt plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they 
received a score or not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi

Polk 
Elementary teachers in their first or second year of teaching are actively participating in the Beginning Teacher Induction p
rogram, and have a 
mentor who meets regularly with the teacher. Induction program teachers are given the opportunity to observe exe
mplary teachers in the District as 
well as receive district training and attend professional workshops and seminars.
 
 
Over the past three years, components of our professional development (PD) have evolved to meet the instructional needs of ou
r students. T
his began 
with the primary focus area for Polk's staff development is the continued development of our grade level Professional Learnin
g Communities(PLCs). We 
refined our primary focus to ensure that students continue to receive intentional literacy suppor
t based on their academic needs, combined with 
providing instructional support in literacy for all grades TK
-
6 within the classroom. Over the past two years, our focus has included alongside our literacy 
development, an aligned focus for out integrated and
 
designated ELD instruction and supports. Reflective looking at both the SBAC and ELPAC data 
communicated a need for continued building of capacity and refinement of instructional practices. This professional developme
nt focus helps continued 
the process o
f building the systems and expertise in our staff to provide the best literacy/EL support on a daily basis through whole
-
class teaching and 
small group instruction while expanding that capacity into the content areas of science and social studies. Teachers
 
continue to be supported in this 
process through the Professional Development delivered, PLC collaboration, model lessons (provided by on
-
site and district personnel), and reflective 
dialogue around current data.
 
 
 
During the 2017
-
2018 school year, we con
tinued to adapt our literacy support systems to meet our students' needs. We continued the opportunities for 
staff to strengthen their capacity in the areas of reading and reading assessments. Professional Development was focused on t
he articulation and 
im
plementation of Learning Goals and Success Criteria in conjunction with Effective Feedback. Utilizing writing as the starting
 
point for this development 
allows an opportunity for each of those focus areas to have an impacting role in student performance. W
e have continued to focus on our EL students 
and strategies that benefit all students in their reading development. Becoming familiar with the new ELA adoption and enhanc
ing our ability to break 
down the text to ensure an understanding for all of our stude
nts has been threaded throughout our PD timeline for the school year.
 
 
During the 2018
-
2019 school year, we continue our focus on literacy and EL. ELPD has focused on model lesson observation of a designated less
on in 
conjunction with an opportunity to hea
r the process for the design of the lesson observed. Debrief opportunities allowed for teachers to ask specific 
questions about the lesson or the incorporation of strategies utilized into their own designated EL instruction. A valuable c
omponent of the ELP
D was 
the planning time that grade levels had at the conclusion of the debrief to build a designated lesson to utilize within their
 
classroom. PD had also focused 
on integrated ELD instructional practices and strategies. Focused on how to connect EL suppor
ts throughout the instructional day and across grade levels. 
We are also conducting the Lesson Study process as a site
-
based professional development for all grade levels (TK
-
6). This will allow all grade
-
level teams 
the ability to collectively plan, teach
 
(observe student learning), and debrief around a lesson that they identified as one' take
-
away' to will provide insight 
into their instructional practice. PD in the spring will also include sessions on Social Emotional Learning to enhance our ca
pacity to 
effectively support 
students who require additional support in this area.
 
 
As we progress through the 2019
-
2020 school year, we focus our professional development on supporting ELA and math using science and social studies 
curriculum. In addition an emphas
is on integrated EL best practices for science and social studies lesson design and instructional implementation. 
Additional topics support the use of literacy programs such as Rhyme Magic and supporting math instruction through the use of
 
identifying spec

targets that support individual standards. Student behavior and mindfulness have been supported through professional developm
ent sessions that focus 
on the identification of students' behavior needs and strategies to provide necessary support includin
g the development of calming corners, as well as 
on the implementation of Second Step. Professional development takes place both on minimum days monthly and through professio
nal learning 
communities weekly. In addition to PLC development, other professiona
l development offerings include English Learner Professional Development with 
an emphasis on good first teaching specifically on research
-
based instructional best practices which include posting an appropriate learning objective 
(measurable) and intentiona
lly teaching the learning objective and referencing it throughout the lesson. The use of SBE
-
adopted, local Board approved 
core curriculum and providing closure which intentionally provides the students with the opportunity to link their learning t
o the le
arning objective. 
Utilizing both a three
-

-
based lesson design to provide students in rigorous, 
relevant, standards
-
based instruction provides a framework for learning in an engaging,
 
applicable, and meaningful way. Using a variety of engagement 
strategies with opportunities to justify their thinking in collaborative groupings and checking for understanding is a system
 
that provides for equitable 
distribution of response opportunities.
 
A variety of response methods and providing differentiated support throughout each stage of instruction and 
finally using academic vocabulary throughout the lesson ensures that all of our students receive first best instruction. Thro
ugh the use of inquiry
, students 
are provided the opportunity to work through tasks and authentic assessments to show how they can apply their knowledge to pr
oblem solve.
 
 
Professional development training is delivered on
-
site and at the District Office by principals, District 
Office administrators or other educational 
professionals. Teachers are supported in training to practice by site administrators and our district coaches. Supports inclu
de lesson study, co
-
lesson 
planning, co
-
teaching, and follow up debrief sessions, as wel
l as educational rounds focusing on student learning. Training to practice implementation 
support is provided in grade levels, by an individual teacher or all staff professional development based on specific support
 
needs. Student learning data 
always driv
es the need for professional development. PLCs meet at least twice a week focusing on specific content areas, and to analyze 
student learning 
data which in turn drives instructional planning, lesson design, and supports in the classroom. Professional Devel
opment is ongoing throughout the school 
year in addition to weekly PLCs.

identified using DIBELS, Fountas and Pinnell, score below proficiency on ELA/Math Benchmarks, and other school assessments. T
hese students are 
provided strategic and intensive targeted intervention supports to improve their proficiency in literacy and math
. Ongoing targeted support outside of 
the school day (before school Lexia and After School Tutoring for grades 1
-
6), provides students with additional Reading Fluency and Reading 
Comprehension supports as measured by Fountas and Pinnell reading assessments
, in addition to math support. Categorical funding provides additional 
language
-
development support for our English Learners students that are struggling to close the academic achievement gap through a Pri
mary Language 
Tutor (PLT). Meeting with EL students
 
daily provides additional small group language development support to our students in the most need for language 
development. Extended instructional aide time is supported through categorical funding as well to maximize the academic syste
ms and supports i
n our 
TK and Kindergarten classrooms. ST Math (The Mind Institute), a web
-
