By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General: The district places a strong emphasis on ensuring that all schools are safe, clean, environmentally friendly, 
mechanically functional and inviting for students, staff members, and the commun
ity. To assist in this effort, the district 
utilizes Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC and local operations department developed 
inspection survey methods to keep facilities in compliance with all federal and state he
alth and safety regulations. The 
district regularly inspects and reviews the condition of the school facilities and surrounding grounds. The district places 
the highest priority on those safeguards that impact the fire, life and safety protection of the st
udents, staff, and school 
buildings. Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students 
are provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School Buildings: 
Summerdale was opened in 1975. This school has 22 regular classrooms, a multipurpose room, a 
library, and an administration building. In addition to the main buildings, there are seven portable classrooms that have 
been added to accommodate class size redu
ction, and after school community programs.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order system process is used to 
ensure efficient service and 

in good working order.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule: The district has developed cleaning standards and 
schedules for all schools in the district. 
A summary of these standards and schedules is available at the school or the Maintenance & Operations office. The 
principal, with the guidance of the maintenance supervisor works daily with the custodial team to e
nsure that the cleaning 
standards are met, and that classrooms, restrooms, and campus grounds are kept clean, safe, and well
-
maintained.
 
 
Modernization Projects: All scheduled Modernization projects were completed as a part of (Measure L) during the 2016/1
7 
school year.

through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Summerdale staff 
members believe parent involvement is an important component of school success for their students 
and recognize the importance of families as mentors in the lives of their children. Teachers collaborate with parents, 
guardians, and other significant family
 
caregivers in providing appropriate homework assignments, special enrichment 
projects, guest speakers, strategies for academic and social progress, field trips, special cultural events and/or holiday 
celebrations for the students. Parents have the opportu
nity to serve a two year term in any office on parent committees, 
such as the School Site Council, the English Language Advisory Council, the Parent Teacher Association, and the School 
Saftey Committee and participate as advisors to the staff and administr
ator. The allocation of state and federal funds 
annually determines the level of resources for special student programs, and must be written and approved by the school 
staff, the School Site Council, and the Berryessa School Board for adoption. Parents als
o represent the school at district 
meetings to help guide planning for the improvement of academic programs and services to English learners, Title I 
students and students needing additional academic support. They share updated federal, state, and district
 
information 
presented at the district meetings to other parents at site parent meetings and in the monthly newsletters. Meetings and 
events are publicized to parents in the monthly school newsletter, on the school's marquee, and by voicemail calls to all 
families. The principal, classroom teachers, and support
-
staff members join parents at monthly PTA meetings to plan fund
-
raising activities, decide on events to sponsor, and develop volunteer schedules.
 
 
Each year, teachers present the grade level standard
s and classroom expectations to the families of their students at Back 
to School Night. Teachers invite parents to assist them in the preparation of classroom materials, chaperoning of students 
on field trips, and the presentation of special enrichment act
ivities or events. In the primary grades, teachers demonstrate 
literacy and numeracy skills to parents for their use at home to help their children gain academic confidence while 
completing their homework. At several grade levels, special programs are prep
ared and presented to the parents to 
highlight student performance skills in reciting poems, instrumental music concerts, singing songs, performing dances, 
reciting speeches and making announcements. These performances also showcase student adherence to fo
llowing social 
skills and procedures during a performance.
 
 
During Open House each spring, students present special projects to families visiting their classroom. Writing samples 
from each class showcasing student skills in language arts are on display in 
the main hallway. The teachers who have been 
trained in Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL) invite parents into their classrooms for Gallery Walks
-
 
where students 
showcase what they have learned in the current unit of study. In January parents have the 
opportunity to see what their 
children are learning "live" when they attend our school wide Learning Showcase. At this event students serve as 
classroom and learning tour guides for parents and other visitors. Students have the opportunity to contribute to
 
the 
production of a class book or produce their own each year, as part of the Student Treasures program. Selected samples 
of student art annually become part of the district
-
wide art exposition at the district office and parents are invited to 
attend a re
ception to view their child's work. Families attend music concerts showcasing student talent twice a year and 
may support the district's music program by volunteering at the annual Art and Wine Festival.
 
 
Parents assist students with special community serv
ice events such as the annual Santa Clara County Second Harvest food 
collection drive. For events requiring additional parent support, such as picture day, vision, hearing, or dental screening 
days, or book fairs, volunteers give generously of their time t
o supervise students during the event. ELAC meetings for 
parents of students who are English learners allow for school updates on student achievement and sharing of school news.

In addition to a monthly school newsletter, many teachers provide weekly news
letters or use the Remind App to highlight 
special student accomplishments, high interest activities, special assessments, and other information about their 
classroom activities. The exchange of information with families through the telephone or the intern
et and parent surveys 
also helps guide the planning process for an effective program for the students. Each fall and again in March, teachers 
have a conference with the parents or guardians of every student in their class to review the academic progress pr
esented 
on their report card. Teachers plan additional conferences with parents of students still needing additional academic 
support to meet standards. All parents may request a teacher or principal conference during the year, and all parents are 
encourag
ed to join the school committees through reminders in English, Vietnamese, Spanish, and Chinese in the monthly 
newsletter.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Summerdale School makes student safety a top priority. Monthly safety drills prepare staff and students for emergencies, 
including fires and earthquakes. In addition, police officers annually review the School Saf
ety Plan which includes 
procedures on school
-
 
wide lockdowns, fire drills, and evacuation in the event of an emergency. The district and site 
principal monitor the implementation of these procedures for student safety. The school safety team meets regularl
y to 
discuss safety issues and to update our school safety plan to meet district, city, county, and state emergency guidelines. 
Teachers store supplies for use in an emergency.
 
 
Students learn and practice rules in their classrooms for citizenship and basi
c safety as part of the school safety plan. At 
the beginning of each school year, students and parents sign a contract agreeing to abide by the rules established for the 
safety of all students, and district and school rules are distributed to all families 
as part of the school safety plan. All recess 
periods and lunch periods have teachers or paid adults supervise students, in order to monitor the use of safe practices 
by students on the playgrounds.
 
 
Annually, a member of the San Jose Police Department als
o trains fourth and fifth grade students and their teacher 
coordinator to follow Safety Patrol procedures while assisting families to cross in crosswalks during the daily arrival and 
dismissal of students. Teachers also supervise the safety patrol students
 
daily during their patrol time, in order to monitor 
and enhance safe procedures for participating students.
 
 
Summerdale School adheres to the Berryessa Union School District written Board Policy in regard to bullying. Bullying is 
addressed with students i
n school wide assemblies, classroom meetings/discussions, and in small groups or on an 
individual basis with the principal and/or social worker. An additional safety component of the school is the referral of 
students to their teacher or principal for the 
violation of school rules. A plan of action is included in the school and family 
compact signed by both student and parents and reviewed with students by the principal when disciplinary actions are 
taken. Parent involvement includes a note written by the s
tudent to parents and teacher explaining the student's actions 
and consequences, and where necessary, a call to parents in addition to the note. Copies of all communications are kept 
in a binder for the school year.

Professional Development this school year occurred on many different levels 

 
before school started (summer of 2019) 
and ongoing throughout the 2019 

 
2020 
school year.  The district office working with our site principals and curriculum 
leadership teams developed the scope/sequence of the professional development.  Leadership teams reviewed student 
data produced from benchmark tests, ELPAC, and SBAC data, as
 
well as staff feedback when developing the scope and 
sequence.

At the beginning of the school year, all certificated and classified staff participated in two days of professional 
development aligned to their instructional role and needs.  TK
-
5 teachers r
eceived training on providing effective Tier 1 
instruction in math and ELA.  Special education staff, social workers and psychologists received training on topics pertinent
 
to their needs such as All Learning is Social Emotional, TCI De
-
Escalation, Instruc
tional Scaffolding to Assist and Support 
Student , and Data Collection and Behavior Management.  Middle school staff received specialized training related to the 
content they teach, that focused on the social emotional element of learning as well as recent
ly adopted curriculum.  All 
middle school teachers participated in a workshop on understanding gender.  Training for new teachers focused on 

h their 
certificated colleagues in order to have the opportunity to collaborate while learning.  They also attended other sessions 
designed to meet their specific professional needs.
 
 
During the school year middle school, science teachers were released up 
to three days to collaborate on implementation 
of the new science program.  Middle school math and writing teachers scored and/or analyze student benchmarks during 
release days for each grade.  7th grade science teachers were released for 1
-
2 days for trai

comprehensive sexuality program.  Additional training was offered on release day for special education teachers to 
support implementation of our dyslexia curriculum as well as special education components of our ELA programs.
 
 
Throug
hout the school year, we offered monthly professional development sessions in which all teachers participated (1.5 
hours on 10 early release Thursday afternoons).  Principals and district office administrators chose the topics for the 2019
-
2020 school year
 
in alignment with the District focus on developing a multi
-
tiered system of support.
 
 
The Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL) program was implemented at six of our ten elementary schools in grades TK
-
3.  The schools included were Cherrywood, Laneview, 
Summerdale, Brooktree, Toyon and Vinci Park.   Teachers in the first 
two years of implementation received three two
-
day training modules each followed by a day of unit planning.  Teachers 
in the third and fourth year of implementation participated in three
 
days of unit planning.  Contracted SEAL experts 
provided the module training sessions and three district instructional coaches facilitated the follow up planning PD 
sessions.  Teachers were released from their classrooms for all of these PD days.
 
 
Four in
structional coaches provided BTSA induction training for all teachers who qualified to receive BTSA training and 
support. Additionally, BUSD teachers provide PAR assistance to teachers who are in need of additional assistance.  All 
teachers have access to 
an instructional coach so that they can receive follow up support on implementing new learning 
attended through professional development.
 
 
An MTSS committee and Differentiated Assistance Team received 3
-
5 days of training on change management facilitated 
b
y WestEd and the Santa Clara County Office of Education.  Some members also participated in 3 training sessions of 
equity.  Team members then trained principals during monthly professional development meetings.   The focus of both 
teams aligned with the di
strict goal of developing multi
-
tiered systems of support at each site.
