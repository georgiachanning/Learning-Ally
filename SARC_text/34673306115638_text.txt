Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
School Vision and Mission:
 
At Gold Ridge, students receive exemplary academic instruction.
 
Teachers are knowledgeable and skilled at engaging and challenging students.
 
Students move on to the next grade level 
well
-
prepared.
 
Teachers believe in working together to support student success. Teachers meet and work collaboratively on a regular 
basis. Ensuring the success of all students is a team effort.
 
Learning is enriched and strengthened through technology and t
he arts.
 
We are committed to the inclusion and integration of all students.
 
 
School & Community Profile:
 
Gold Ridge Elementary is a Pre K
-
5 school located in the Broadstone neighborhood of Folsom. Kemp Park and wetland 
marshes, ponds, and creeks are 
within easy walking distance. The campus houses 25 classrooms, a library, a Student Care 
Center, and both Special Education and Adult Education preschool programs. Our multipurpose building includes a stage 
and a serving kitchen; gym facilities are shared 
with the Folsom Parks and Recreation Department.
 
 
As of California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (Calpads) 2018, our student enrollment was 612 students. 
We have a racially and culturally diverse student population representative of California
.  Our students speak 
approximately 30 different home languages; and language minority students represent 30 percent of our school 
population.
 
 
Our teachers and staff are committed to high academic expectations with individualized support to help all stude
nts 
master content standards. To compliment our academic emphasis, we believe all students benefit from a rich variety of 
experiences in music, physical education, technology, and the arts. Our teachers partner with parent volunteers and 
community groups t
o extend learning through programs such as Eagles Art (a docent led visual arts program), 3E Science, 
PC Pals (provided by Intel Corporation volunteers), and a variety of after school clubs. Our commitment to visual and 
performing arts is on display at our
 
annual Celebration of the Arts.
 
 
Parents are engaged in a wide variety of leadership and volunteer activities that enrich and support learning. Our  Parent 
Teacher Association (PTA) sponsors community events such as our Back to School Kick Off and Winter 
Wonderland, funds 
assemblies, and organizes enrichment activities such as Science Fair and our parent docent Science Technology 
Engineering and Math (STEM) program 3E Science. Approximately 300 parents sign up each year to work as science and 
art docents, 
volunteer in classrooms, and chaperone field trips.

Folsom Cordova Unified held a Public 
Hearing on December 19, 2019, and determined that each school within the District 
has sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students,
 
including English learners, are given their own individual standards

textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle 
developed by the State Department of Education, making the 
textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committ
ee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. 
The table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Gold Ridge is a safe and clean facility. There were eleven (11) student accidents reported at our school in the 2018
-
2019 
school year. Restrooms and the cafeteria are cleaned daily. Classrooms are cleaned every other day. Any safety hazard 
that is reported
 
is reviewed immediately and resolved. Emergency plans have been developed in the event a threatening 
situation should arise.
 
 
Gold Ridge has identified three overarching rules to support positive behavior at school: be safe, be respectful, and be 
responsi
ble. The school rules are published in the Student/Parent Handbook and reviewed with students each trimester 
through a broad based Positive Behavior Intervention and Support (PBIS) program. Gold Ridge PBIS includes an Eagle ticket 
program with monthly and 
weekly reinforcement activities, grade level behavior videos, special assemblies, and classroom 
based instruction. Physical education teachers present guidelines for safety using playground equipment and rules for 
games.

Gold Ridge addresses safety in mul
tiple other ways as well.  We maintain a close alliance with the Folsom Fire Department 
and with the Folsom Police Department. The safety team consists of the principal, the department chair, the Physical 
Education (PE) specialist, the head custodian, and 
the Office staff. Each member has a radio for communication during 
drills and if an unexpected emergency were to occur. The team meets monthly to review safety procedures and plan 
emergency drills. Additionally, campus supervisors are trained on campus rul
es, and crisis and safety protocols.
