School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Vantage Point Charter School provides individualized learning using an independent study model.  Students choose 
independent study for a wide variety of reasons including acceleration, credit recovery, medical reasons, fam
ily lifestyle 
choice, work schedules, and access to non
-
traditional learning.
 
 
Vantage Point Charter is located in Nevada County, 8 miles West of the communities of Grass Valley and Nevada City.  It 
began as a home school program in 1989 with one student. 
In 1993, the program was granted California Charter School 
status.  Vantage Point serves students in grades K
-
12.  It is the desire of Vantage Point Charter School to expanded 
educational offerings by providing early intervention with choices and opportuni
ties, in order to serve the diverse needs 
of students and parents.  Tutoring and enrichment classes are offered on campus.
 
 
Mission Statement:  Vantage Point Charter School's mission is to help our students attain academic, cultural, social, and 
emotional 
literacy.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

ration.
 

 
By adhering to guidelines set forth by Vantage Point.
 

 
By attending parent meetings.
 

 
By responding to parent surveys.
 

 
By participating in as a member of the Charter Advisory Council.
 
By participating in other parent involvement activities such as the WASC committee when needed.

There are five District

wide in
-
service days each year that Vantage Point teachers participate in.  There are also 
opportunities for individual staff members to attend grade level or curriculum specific workshops throughout the year.  
The primary focus for
 
the past three years has been Common Core transition and implementation, especially in the area 
of mathematics.  Lesson planning, standards knowledge and depth of questioning have all been addressed in District 
through professional days, both on site and 
off site.
