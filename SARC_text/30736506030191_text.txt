By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
University Park was the first elementary school built in the Irvine Unified School District in 1967.  The staff 
and community 
are proud of it's heritage and particularly their commitment to meet the challenges of providing a top notch education to 
a dynamic population. University Park is a Title 1 school, houses one of our district's Newcomer English Learner Program
s 
and serves our special education population with a Learning Center model, maximizing learning in the least restrictive 
environment. We celebrate the diversity of cultures as our families come from all over the world and over 20 languages 
are spoken schoo
l wide.
 
 
University Park's mission is to have ALL staff collaborate in ways that result in the creation and continuous implementation 
of a learning model that maximizes learning for ALL students in ALL learning environments. Our teachers attend 
professiona
l development to ensure the implementation of best instructional practice. We at University Park consider the 
whole child and were one of the first schools to implement Positive Behavior and Intervention Support (PBIS) school wide. 
We believe that if we te
ach expected behaviors and support that learning with positive reinforcement that we can 
maximize instructional time with a rigorous curriculum. Through PBIS, we teach and instill the habits of Punctual & 
Prepared, Respect, Integrity, Dependability and kee
ping Everyone Safe, known as Panther P.R.I.D.E. Additionally, we 
address students social and mental health concerns with a Guidance Technician who provides social skills and problem 
solving curriculum in the classroom, small group and one on one support tw
o days a week. Our Elementary Resource 
Counselor is on campus three days per week and also provides small group, one on one counseling, and lunch time social 
groups.
 
 
University Park teachers and staff focus on respect of the individual student, their lear
ning strengths, and the belief that 
while students may have learning challenges, ALL students can learn.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
University Park was built in 1967 and is one of the original IUSD schools. In 2005, the school underwent an extensive 
modernization of our campus and is slated for further improvements beginning in 2021. The modernization 
completed in 
2005 provided our multipurpose room with new acoustics and lighting for staged productions, new playground equipment 

computer lab w
as created with seating for forty students. In 2017 our computer lab was transformed into our Innovation 
Lab with flexible seating, multiple projectors, green screen, and enhanced technology for student use. Recent facility 
improvements include strengtheni
ng the technology infrastructure to support 1:1 access to technology throughout the 
entire campus, installing security cameras, and installing auto
-
lock doors to improve safety response systems on campus.
 
 
In Fall 2018 our landscaping was renovated school
-
wide including replanting the slope on Sandburg and all internal 
planters. Continued attention to ongoing maintenance keeps the school clean and well landscaped.

The
 
SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative A
ssessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participat
e in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students wh
o have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the s
chool district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Research has shown that a major contributing factor to a child's success in school 
is directly related to their parents' 
involvement in their education at home and at school. We encourage a high degree of parent involvement in every aspect 
of school life. We have a strong PTA, and parent members on our School Site Council, and English La

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We have a 
comprehensive emergency preparedness plan which was updated September, 2019. The policy includes 
detailed procedures for a variety of possible emergencies including earthquakes, fires, site evacuations, and lockdown 
situations for intruders on campus. We w
ork each year with the Irvine School District to perform monthly practice drills 
and simulate necessary communications utilizing satellite radios. Students are taught during these drills exactly what 
procedures to follow in the event of an emergency. All s
tudents are kept on campus and supervised by school staff. 
Additionally, our staff is trained annually by both district/site professional development activities and in coordination wit
h 
the Irvine Police Department. Emergency response teams have been ident
ified within our school site staff and each 
member has been trained in their responsibilities. Emergency supplies are maintained for the safety and protection of our 
students.  We have phones installed in every classroom and an electronic security system i
n key areas of the school.

The Local Control 

place of more than 40 specific funding categories, the new model has established three sources of state funding with 
increased local discretion to determ
ine how best to spend those funds in the service of students.  All districts receive a 
BASE of per
-
student funding that varies slightly depending on grade level.  All districts also receive SUPPLEMENTAL 
funding.  IUSD has used BASE and SUPPLEMENTAL funding
 
to support the following programs:
 
 
Site Programs and Services:  1) Support professional learning and teacher coaching through induction program, content 
TOSAs and teacher mentor program , 2) provide summer school and summer athletic programs, 3) Allocati
ng site funding 
and staffing to support student achievement through support of Professional Learning Communities (PLC) and site PLC 
coaches, 4) Elementary P.E. paraprofessionals, 5) Support for English language learners, 6) Elementary science, music, and 
a
rt programs, 7) Purchase textbooks and instructional materials, 8) Develop a technology rich learning environment 
including; Technology matching programs, Technology Maintenance fund and site technology support staff, 9) Maintain 
previously implemented cla

Develop mental health and wellness programs and hire district and site based staff including support for the Irvine Family 
Resource Center.
 
 
Finally, CONCENTRATION grant funding equal to 50 percent 
of the base is provided to districts in which English
-
learners, 
low
-
income students and foster youth exceed 55 percent of the total enrollment.  Irvine Unified School District is not 
eligible for concentration funding because its enrollment does not exceed
 
the 55 percent threshold.

2018: This year the focus of our 
professional development hours centered around PLC's, intervention, data and 
assessment, and social emotional learning. To support the social, emotional and behavioral needs skills necessary for all 
students, especially our at
-
risk students, to be academic
ally successful in the classroom we partnered with a non
-
profit 

opportunities for physical activity and safe, meaningful play. Our goal in br
inging the Playworks program to University Park 
is to increase our focus on the needs of our low income students and providing them as many opportunities as possible 
to help them achieve a high level of healthy play.  Research shows that play is an essenti
al developmental tool to improve 
the educational environment for every student. In the 2017/18 school year, the District adopted a new Language Arts 
series, and as a school site we have incorporated WIN (What I Need) time to assist with intervention and en
richment for 
all our students. This time allows us to provide instruction for all students based on specific learning targets.
