School Description
 
Union Street Charter (USC) is a unique K
-
5 school that balances arts and academics in a family 
atmosphere. The school began operation in August of 2006 and is housed on a rural campus that is 
an integral part of the surrounding community. It is within walk
ing distance of Humboldt State 
University, the Arcata Community Center, a marsh and forest. We believe we are high performing 
in part because we attract highly qualified, dedicated and enthusiastic teachers, as well as invested 
parents and students from th
e surrounding communities. The teachers and principal collaboratively 
choose engaging research
-
based curriculum. USC is a highly sought after school for multiple 
reasons: small class size (17 students), parent involvement, engaging academic content, and tw
ice 
weekly instruction in Spanish, art and music.
 
 
The initial school years are crucial to a child's educational attitudes and future success in learning. 
We are committed to providing a nurturing environment and fostering high self
-
esteem and 
confidence. 
The students are part of a learning community that emphasizes collaboration, critical 
thinking, and creativity. Student success at Union Street Charter is based on academic growth, a 
well
-
developed sense of self worth, and a willingness to accept challenge
s.
 
 
At Union Street Charter, we believe in the unique value of each student, family, and teacher 
-
 
both 
as individuals and as members of the school community. We work together to create an 
environment that minimizes the pressures of popular culture and the
 
use of academic competition 
as motivation. Our ultimate aim is to turn a child's natural curiosity and desire to explore into a 
lifelong love of learning. We value the trust that families place in us, as we guide students toward 
a deeper understanding of 
themselves and the world around them.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
