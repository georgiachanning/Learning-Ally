By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Marigold serves families in the northeast area of Chico. In ad
dition to regular program students, Marigold houses one 
resource classroom. Marigold is a neighbor of Loma Vista, a CUSD Special Education school, and Pleasant Valley High 
School.  Marigold has a mainstreaming  program with Loma Vista's TK class and an eff
ective student aide program with 
the high school's education career pathways program.  With the passing of Measure K in November of 2016, plans are 
moving forward with a complete renovation of the campus. As of September 2019, we have eight fully renovated
, like
-
new classrooms designed for kindergarten and first grade complete with new furniture and interactive teaching 
technology. We also have a new two
-
story building in the center of campus. It includes a new media center/library and 
sixteen classrooms se
t to house second, third, fourth, and fifth grades. Loma Vista moved in to their new facility on the 
Manzanita Avenue side of campus in March 2019. Construction is progressing on Marigold's main parking lot, new 
administration building and cafeteria comple
te with a full basketball court and stage. After the relocation of the 
administration office and cafeteria in year 2020, construction will begin on a full renovation of the old cafeteria to create
 
two large special education classrooms and many new office 
spaces. Please stop by our office to view blueprints, follow 
us on Facebook, or look on the CUSD website for more details.
 
 
The following statements were developed by our School Site Council and Marigold Leadership Team in order to 
communicate our ideals
 
to the community:
 
 
Marigold's mission is to ensure the academic, emotional, and social success for every student in a safe, responsible, and 
respectful learning environment. We provide a sound education emphasizing Language Arts and Mathematics, as well
 
as 
Social Studies, Science, Visual and Performing Arts, Physical Education and Technology while promoting self
-
esteem. Our 
goal and motto is to ensure that "Every Student is Academically, Emotionally, and Socially Successful Everyday".
 
 
It is the vision
 
of the Chico Unified School District and Marigold Elementary School to teach students to be confident 
individuals with positive self
-
esteem; educated, responsible, enlightened citizens; effective communicators; creative 
problem solvers, critical reflectiv
e thinkers; self
-
directed life
-
long learners; users of appropriate technology; and 
productive members of the workforce. In our vision, all students will be successful academically as measured by the State 
wide SBAC assessments as well as district benchmark
 
achievement data.

Updated and readily available resources are important for students to perform at their best in clas
s. The State of California 
adopts textbooks that meet quality standards established by the State Board of Education. The Chico Unified School 
District selects textbooks and other instructional materials from these state adoptions. All of the textbooks curr
ently in 
use meet these standards. They were selected to match the needs of Chico students by a Task Force comprised of teachers 
and administrators and approved by the Board of Education. The CUSD convenes curricular task forces to review textbooks 
in core
 
subject areas on the Kindergarten through 8th grade state adopted list concurrent with the adoption cycle. These 
standards aligned textbooks are in the hands of all students when the textbooks are adopted and delivered.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Marigold was originally built in 1960. For many years the growth of the student population was met with relocatable 
classrooms. With the passing o
f Measure K in November of 2016, plans are moving forward with a complete renovation 
of the campus. All relocatable classrooms have been removed or demolished as part of the renovation. As of September 
2019, we have eight fully renovated, like
-
new classroo
ms designed for kindergarten and first grade complete with new 
furniture and interactive teaching technology. We also have a new two
-
story building in the center of campus. It includes 
a new media center/library and sixteen classrooms set to house second, 
third, fourth, and fifth grades. Our kindergarten 
has a new playground and a new track was created with sod in the far field for all to use. Loma Vista moved in to their 
new facility on the Manzanita Avenue side of campus in March 2019. Construction is pro
gressing on Marigold's main 
parking lot, new administration building and cafeteria complete with a full basketball court and stage. After the relocation 
of the administration office and cafeteria in year 2020, construction will begin on a full renovation o
f the old cafeteria to 
create two large special education classrooms and many new office spaces. Please stop by our office to view blueprints, 
follow us on Facebook, or look on the CUSD website for more detail.
 
 
The Chico Unified School District works to
 
ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. District maintenance staff 
ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed. A work order 
process is used to ensure efficient service and that eme
rgency repairs are given the highest priority. The district 
maintenance and operations department and site administration work with the custodial staff to develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school. Visitors are required to check in with 
the school office when entering the 
school grounds. The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program and the newly acquired 
Measure E funding, to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existin
g school building 
components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, floors and technology.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety plan is updated annually by the School Site Council in accordance with Senate Bill 187. The 
School Safety 
Plan includes emergency procedures for traumatic incidents, imminent danger, evacuation, civil defense, bomb threat, 
earthquake, chemical spill, crime, fire/explosion plans, and community use of facilities. An emergency drill schedule is 
deve
loped and implemented annually.  We hold a minimum of one fire drill a month, two earthquake drills a year, and 
four code red drills a year.  A School Crisis Team has been identified and trained.  The School Site Council meets about 
three times throughout 
the year to address school safety concerns and monitor the safe schools budget.
