Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Profile:
 
The Ready Springs Elementary School is located in Pe
nn Valley, California and is in the Penn Valley Union Elementary 
School District.  Ready Springs Elementary School was established in 1868.  Currently, Ready Springs serves TK
-
8 students.  
We have a full day Transitional Kindergarten class and a full day K
indergarten class.  Our ASES funded After School Program 
is available to all families at no charge.  We also offer before school care at no charge to families beginning at 7:15 a.m. 
 
Ready Springs is a rural school that sits adjacent to some of the only av

We have one of the County run Family Resource Centers housed on our site where families can get support to access other 
available resources such as counseling, mental health services, in
-
home support ser
vices, as well as parenting classes and 
supports. During the 2019
-
2020 school year the district has fully implemented Universal Access, which we have titled Me 
Time, (Meaningful Enrichment). This dedicated block of time is intended to meet the individual s
tudents' academic and 
social
-
emotional needs within mixed age level groupings. The dedication and commitment of all district staff has earned 
the highly sought ofter, Golden Bell Award.
 
 
School Mission Statement: To understand each child and promote indivi
dual success, we will build relationships with 
knowledge, enthusiasm, and patience. By advocating, encouraging, and modeling with compassion and respect for our 
students, they will learn that life
-
long growth and change are achievable through hard work and
 
perseverance.
 
 
School Vision: The Penn Valley Union Elementary School District inspires a passion for learning and promotes engagement 
and belonging while maximizing the potential of every member of our school community.
 
 
Ready Springs is a school

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents play a very imp
ortant role at Ready Springs School through their active participation and involvement in School 
Site Council, Parent Teacher Committee (PTC), various annual events, advisory committees, and by regularly volunteering 
their services in the classrooms. Paren
ts are considered a vital link in the success of our children and our school. Through 
these organizations and our Roots and Wings Educational Foundation, parents and community members help shape 
curriculum and policies, in addition, funding special project
s to purchasing equipment and supplies to benefit our students. 
All take a supportive, active, and collaborative role in every aspect of our school. The school's website links to a parent

Through the use of Title II funds, teachers have access to professional development that aligns with District, school and/or 
teacher goals.  Nevada County Superintendent of Schools also supports teachers and 
administrators with various 
professional development classes.   Over the past three years, the District provided four professional development days 
with a focus on topics of current relevance as well as time for development of professional learning communi
ties in the 
district.  This year the emphasis has been on social
-
emotional learning and the impact of trauma on education.  There has 
also been an emphasis on assessment data and several teachers in the District have attended workshops on this topic. 
Every
 
Wednesday students are on early release to allow for teacher collaboration time to support with implementation 
for Me Time and intervention groupings.  First and second
-
year teachers participate in 90 hours of mandatory professional 
development each year 
through the North Coast Teacher Induction Program for beginning teachers.
