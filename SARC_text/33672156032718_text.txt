School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The table displays information collected in in September 2019 about the 
quality, currency, and availability of the 
standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school.
 
 
It was determined that each RUSD school had sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab 
equipme
nt, where appropriate, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core 
subjects for use in
 
the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a 
6
-
year cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most 
current available. Materials approved for u
se by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to 
the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to a
doption
 
 
Riverside Unified School District adopts instructional materials on a regular schedule based on State adoptions. All 
students receive appropriate, up
-

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are encouraged to be an active part of their child's school experience. 
 
 
Parent
-
Teacher Association (PTA) meetings are held several times each year, usually in conjunction with another school 
event such as Back to School Night and Open House. All 
parents are encouraged to attend. PTA Board Meetings are held 
once per month, after school. Please call the office for contact information.
 
 
School Site Council Meetings are held 8 times per year. All parents are welcome to attend.
 
 
Our English 
Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) meets throughout the year. Please call for specific dates and times.
 
 
Teachers invite and encourage volunteers in the classrooms. Visits to classrooms are scheduled one day in advance 
according to RUSD School Board Policy.
 
All visitors on campus need to check
-
in at the school office and check
-
out at the 
office after the visit.
 
 
Communication with parents is given a high priority on our campus. Communication is made via flyers, notes home, phone 
calls, individual meetings/co
nferences, autodialer, and through the school website. Parents are encouraged to meet with 
teachers on an ongoing basis. We appreciate parents' ideas, observations, and suggestions. PTA events, other school 
events such as band concerts, as well as Principa
l's Coffee meetings are all opportunities for parents to connect with the 
school. Magnolia believes that the stronger the team between teacher, parent and student, the more successful the 
student will be.
 
 
Parents are encouraged to attend all parent meetin
gs, parent workshops and volunteer in their child's classroom. A 
parent's interest in, and participation in, his or her child's education will have a lasting impact.
 
 
Training will be held for parents:
 

 
Math training on the use of manipulative,
 

 
Using techno
logy to enhance parent opportunities to be active participants in their child's learning,
 

 
Increasing access to school programs, meetings, and training for all parents including bilingual parents.
