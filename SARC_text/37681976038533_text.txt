About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains informatio
n about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they in
tend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requireme
nts, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Murray Manor Campus is a strong example of res

higher levels of success, and satisfaction. Simply put, there is a positive and convincing relationship between family involv

ed 
academic achievement. This relationship holds true across families of all economic, racial/ethnic, and educational background
s. In addition to parent 
involvement at school, family involvement at home appears to have a great achievement impact. We want a
ll families to feel welcome and important at 
Murray Manor. Parents are critical to our success. We ask that parents/guardians be our educational partners in their scholar
's education because 

uragement. By being involved, active, and working together, we will continue the 
tradition of excellence at Murray Manor Campus. Scholars who feel encouraged and cared for are able to achieve at higher leve
ls

the best news is that 
it is within our power to
 
help them do so. Together, as educational partners, we will continue to make this a remarkable school by putting our scholars
 
first in all we do to be the difference.
 
 
We highly encourage parents to become involved in and outside of school, including Pare
nt Educational Presentations, Parent/Teacher Association (PTA), 
School Site Council (SSC), English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), School events (Back
-
To
-
School Night, Open House, Peace Corral, MUM PTA 
activities, etc.). Also, there are other parent com
mittees that are formed for specific programs and/or needs throughout the school year including our 
Art, Physical Education, Garden Docent programs, and the Oasis Tutoring program. Our partnerships with City Hope, Grossmont H
igh School, community 
agencies,
 
and local businesses provide a strong link to our community. Parent/Guardians are always welcome to volunteer, and there are 
many ways to 
be involved such as volunteering in/outside the classroom, assisting with school
-
wide events, helping with projects, 
making copies, etc.

Professional 
learning in La Mesa
-
Spring Valley continues evolving to cultivate capacity and efficacy of teachers so that they can ensure high levels of 
learning for each and every student. In recent years professional learning has emphasized developing a common languag
e around high quality teaching 
and learning and building collaborative cultures that promote high levels of learning for all students through professional l
earning communities. This 
work has included a deeper dive into content standards through the selecti
on of essential standards and discussions around mastery and effective 
assessment. In response to student performance data and classroom observation, current professional learning focuses on align
ing instruction to 
standards and student experience, with ex
tra time and resources dedicated to mathematics and English learners.
 
 
New for the 2019
-
20 school year is our Blended Professional Development program which will offer online professional development options while
 
still 
offering face
-
to
-
face professional d
evelopment. Some of the professional learning that we will offer includes: Igniting ELD multi
-
year seminars where 
teachers learn and implement strategies for designated and integrated ELD and using formative assessment to guide standards
-
based instruction,
 
Mindful 
Math where participants will develop deeper understandings of math teaching and how to enrich it while making the District ma
th curriculum more 
accessible to their students, and ProAct, which teaches participants techniques they can use to deescal
ate a child's behavior.  Additional professional 
development continues to address professional learning communities, curriculum adoptions, differentiation, special education,
 
NGSS and effective 
integration of technology into instruction.
 
 
With professional
 
learning communities as a foundation, professional development is approached from multiple angles to ensure that it is releva
nt, 
timely, and targeted to both student and teacher needs. Teachers meet weekly, as a grade level or discipline, to analyze stud
e
nt data and discuss best 
practices to address the needs of each and every student.
 
 
The district offers workshops and multiple
-
day seminars, after
-
school workshops, online courses, and one
-
on
-
one coaching and modeling. Select teachers 
also attend conferenc
es and workshops offered through outside agencies.  District staff also partners with principals providing professional devel
opment 
at site learning days and staff meetings.
