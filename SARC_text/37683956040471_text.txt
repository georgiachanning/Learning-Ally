By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or
 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
pr
incipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Central's enrollment is at student capacity. Security is bolstered by the presence of a security residen
t who lives on the 
property and inspects the property during nights and weekends to prevent vandalism and theft. In addition, surveillance 
cameras are located throughout the campus.
 
 
District Maintenance and Custodial staff take great care in ensuring that
 
all schools are clean, safe, and functional. Lawns 
are mowed on Saturdays in an effort to minimize any classroom disturbances. Cleaning schedules are developed by the 
Principal and the Facilities Director to guarantee daily cleaning of campus. Restroom fa
cilities are inspected three times a 
day by the Head Custodian to ensure they are fully stocked and in full working order. Any needed repairs are addressed 
in a timely manner. Copies of inspections are available at the school and facilities offices.
 
 
The H
ead Custodian also performs a safety inspection on a monthly basis. The monthly report is submitted to the facilities 
office. Regular and preventative maintenance is ongoing. The district employs a computerized online work order system 
for efficiency and b
etter record keeping.
 
 
As per Education Code, the district is required to include in this document, a description of any needed maintenance to 
ensure good repair as specified in statute. "Good Repair" means the facility is maintained in a manner that assur
es that it 
is clean, safe, and functional as determined pursuant to a Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of 
California Office of Public School Construction (OPSC). The FIT will evaluate the conditions at a school site with ratings of
 
"
good," "fair," or "poor." The FIT also provides an overall summary of the conditions at each school on a scale of 
"exemplary," "good," "fair," or "poor." The instrument shall not require capital enhancements beyond the standards to 
which the facility was d
esigned and constructed.
 
 
SCHOOL FACILITIES GOOD REPAIR STATUS
 
Central Elementary was built in 1951. The following table displays the results of the most recently completed school site 
inspection to determine
 
the school facility's good repair status. The areas listed below as in need of repair are minor and 
expected to be completed during winter break.
 
 
OVERALL SUMMARY OF SCHOOL FACILITY GOOD REPAIR STATUS
 
At the time of the above inspection on August 9, 2019,
 
the average ranking for Central Elementary was 94.44%, giving the 
school a rating of "Good." The rating is determined by the average of the 15 categories addressed. Below are the 
percentages, descriptions, and ratings, as per the Facilities Inspection Too
l (FIT).
 
 
Please note that all needed repairs or deficiencies identified in the August FIT report have been completed and/or 
resolved.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information 
relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general ed
ucation population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs
 
items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses tha
t satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
South Bay Union School District has developed a Crisis Response Box for each of its school sites. Each box contains a 
comprehensive Emergency Procedural Guidelines binder specific to each site. The b
inder includes state required disaster 
procedures such as, but not limited to, bomb threat, earthquake, fire, medical emergency, missing student, and shootings. 
Evacuation maps, evacuation sites, key phone numbers, district/site communication plan, are jus
t a few of the elements 
included within the plan.
 
 
At the site Central has provided each classroom and student space (cafeteria, library, multipurpose rooms) binders that 
include emergency procedures for the site, maps, key phone numbers and the communicat
ion plan. Student rosters are 
provided and updated as students are enrolled/disenrolled. School staff reviewed the school safety and emergency 
procedures prior to the start of the school year during teacher preparation week and again on 7/18/19 and again o
n 
11/6/19. School sites conduct various types of drills on a regular basis throughout the year and record the exercise on the 
Emergency Drills Record form, which is submitted to the district office monthly or upon completion of the drill.

19 School Accountability Report Card for Central Elementary

Based on
 
recent reading comprehension data from CAASPP and Fountas and Pinnell reading data, the focus on reading 
and writing instruction has been necessary at Central Elementary. The overall focus that has developed is on balanced 
literacy, currently emphasizing 
Teachers College Readers and Writers Workshop. All classified and certificated staff that 
directly work with students have been trained in all the components and structures of the workshop. Certificated staff 
have been trained in the administration and ana
lysis of data derived from the Fountas and Pinnell Assessment System. All 
certificated staff have also been trained in guided reading, based on the data derived from the Fountas and Pinnell 
assessment. To support the implementation of these frameworks, the
 
district and school leaders have implemented 
labsite learning opportunities and a TOSA for literacy supports PLC on a monthly basis. Furthermore, staff have 
participated in peer observations to support one another in their efforts to implement the highest
 
quality instruction to 
their students.
 
 
Math is an area of concern for Central with the most recent data from CAASPP indicating a decline in scores. The site 
leader, in conjunction with the district TOSA for math will provide an ongoing cycle of professio
nal learning in order to 
develop teacher skills sets in understanding and applying the math framework standards through the SBUSD developed 
math units of study.
 
 
In addition to literacy it has been determined through LCAP survey that staff and parent stake
holders are in favor of 
continuing the implementation of a school wide Positive Behavior System. Professional development opportunities are 
being offered in this area and a Social Emotional Learning curriculum has been adopted. PD includes school workshops
, 
conferences and individual supports. Progress is being monitored through several measures including data gathered 
through individual class awards, student SMART awards, attendance data and Behavior and Suspension data.
 
 
English Language Learners and ELL 
instruction has also been identified as an area that staff would like increased 
professional development. The data from the previous year's ELPAC testing indicates that students moved at a higher rate 
than in previous years and therefore the school's ELD c
ommittee continues to meet monthly. The ELD committee will 
attend conferences and workshops designed to support the effective implementation of ELD at the site level including 
addressing and professional development needs of teachers and support staff.
 
 
Ce
ntral school, through a needs assessment, equity audit and a variety of surveys has developed the following areas of 
focus for the professional learning and development cycle:
 
 
1. Build a cohesive school wide community by providing Central Way professional
 
learning and development
 
 
2. Provide rigorous & consistent learning for all students by;
 

 
Developing Success Criteria through professional learning and development
 

 
Developing High Functioning Teams through professional learning and development
 
3. Provide 
Professional Learning with a specific focus on Intentional English language development in all content areas
