By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg

.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Calimesa Community, Parents and Students:
 
 
YCJUSD is honored to serve students in two wonderful communities. We, as a team, continue to prepare our students to 
be successful in the 21st century.  We work collaboratively with community partners, businesse
s and colleges to provide 
the best possible education for each and every student. The district employs high quality employees, who care for student 
well
-
being as well as academics.  The school sites have a variety of clubs and programs to suit student inte
rests and all our 
elementary schools have an after school  care program.   We strive to provide a wide variety of high quality services and 
programs in a safe environment.
 
 
As you become a partner of the YCJUSD, please take the opportunity to be involved. 
It is our desire to work hand in hand 
with parents to support our children. The best way to get involved is to start at the school site. Our principals can help 
guide you to the many opportunities that exist. No amount of involvement is too small!  We also
 
offer classes for parents 
that will help you and your child in their educational journey.  We have the Family Learning Center which offers a host of 
classes that support parents in learning strategies to work with children in grades K
-
12.  Please take an 
opportunity to 
view the website to learn more about the classes.
 
 
The role of educating children in our two communities is taken very seriously and we appreciate your trust. My goal, as 
your Superintendent, is to ensure that high quality instruction is del
ivered daily, our campuses are secure and well 
maintained, money is spent wisely, and students graduate from Yucaipa High School prepared to be successful!
 
 
This school year is the opportunity to work with you in supporting education of our children.   Ple
ase do not hesitate to 
contact your principal or the district office if you have questions about the district or how to become involved.

The Yucaipa
-
Calimesa Joint Unified School District sets a high priority to ensure that sufficient and current textbooks and 
materials are available to support each school's i
nstructional program. The district went through an evaluation on October 
1, 2019, and has sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, and/or science lab equipment pursuant to 
the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. The d
istrict determined that there are also sufficient visual and 
performing arts materials.
 
 
All students, including Special Education and English Learner students, have access to adopted instructional materials in 
core subjects.  These materials are for use i
n the classroom and/or to take home to complete required homework 
assignments.  All textbooks and instructional materials used within the district are aligned with the California State Conten
t 
Standards and Frameworks.
 
 
Instructional materials in all subje
cts were approved by the Board of Education. Although the Board
-
adopted instructional 
materials in Mathematics are not on the State Board of Education list, the materials were recommended by an adoption 
committee of staff and community members following ex
tensive research on the alignment of the materials to California 
State Content Standards and Frameworks, and a pilot of the materials to study their positive impact on the children we 
serve. The district has not yet adopted instructional materials in Histo
ry
-
Social Science in the time since the State Board 
approved History
-
Social Science programs in November, 2017. The district is collaborating with community stakeholder 
groups to determine the most appropriate materials for implementing the state standards
 
and framework in History
-
Social Science.
 
 
Chapman Heights Elementary continues to develop an excellent library that currently houses nearly 6,000 titles, not 
counting textbooks, leveled readers, and teacher material available in an adjoining book room.  T
he collection includes 
library bound books, paperbacks, big books, picture books, DVDs, as well as reference and professional materials.  The 
library is staffed by a 15 hours
-
per
-
week library technician, and all classes in grades kindergarten through six v
isit the 
library every other week.  A wide range of picture books are regularly read to students in primary grades and upper grades 
access books for recreational reading and for research.  Two computer stations enable the students to access the collection 
through an online catalog system called InfoCentre, and Internet service is available for additional research.  Students and 
parents may also search the school library's collection from their home computers via the school web site.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents 
continue to play a significant role in establishing and improving the traditions and practices we have started at 
CHES.  Our Parent Teacher Student Association (PTSA) has been a tremendous resource for our students and teachers as 
they have assisted with a
nd sponsored countless school events from August 2008 through June of 2019.
 
 
School staff and PTSA have worked together and provided a family event called, "Chill Out with the Chargers" prior to the 
opening of school.  Parents and students have the opportu
nity to visit the CHES campus, meet teachers, play on the 
playground, and enjoy ice cream and popsicles.  During the first month of school  parent volunteer meetings are held and 
information is shared about all the opportunities that are be available throu
ghout the school year to help in and outside 
the classroom.  Huge Undertakings Great Success (HUGS) assemblies were established when CHES opened in 2008 and 
are held each Friday morning at the start of the school day in order to praise and recognize studen
ts, school staff, and 
parent volunteers for their work, effort and successes at Chapman Heights.  HUGS assemblies and HUGS certificates are 
specifically to celebrate individuals on our campus whose behaviors represent one or more or the Six Character Count
 
Traits.  As a result of the tremendous efforts and energy of our PTSA, school staff members, and some amazing parent 
volunteers, there were dozens of opportunities for parents to attend and/or participate in school activities.  Some of the 
parent involvem
ent activities over these past eight years included:

The Chapman Heights Elementary School Safety Plan is updated annually in July, August, and September, discussed with 
staff at staff meetings in August, September and/or October, and includes evacuation, student supervision, and emergency 
team descriptions 
and duties.  Each month, school
-
wide safety drills are conducted and documented during school hours.  
Drills practiced include exercises for fire, earthquake, and lockdown emergencies.  Annually, CHES participates in the Great 
American Shake
-
Out exercise i
n the middle of October.  The CHES campus classroom exterior doors and gates remain 
locked during school hours for an additional measure of safety.  School ingress and exit points are monitored by school 
staff before school and at dismissal.  All adult vol
unteers working with and around CHES students at anytime during the 
school year must be cleared through the Megan's Law background checks annually.  Visitors to our campus must sign
-
in
