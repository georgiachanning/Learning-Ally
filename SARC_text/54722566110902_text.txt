By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Hurley Elementary School takes great effort to ensure a 
safe, clean, and functional physical environment for students, 
staff, and volunteers. Sufficient space is provided for students and staff to support teaching and learning. This includes 
space provided by classrooms, playgrounds, and the staff workroom. To 
assist our school in this effort, the district uses a 
facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of this 
survey are available at the district office. Additional information about the co
ndition of the school's facilities may be 
obtained by speaking with the school principal.

Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely ma
nner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
In addition to custodial staff on duty during the school day, a team of maintenance specialists come in
 
after hours for daily 
cleaning. District and school maintenance staff work cooperatively with administrators to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Program
 
The district participates in the State School Defer
red Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a 
dollar for dollar basis to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school build
ing 
components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heati
ng, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. The deferred maintenance program ensures that all class¬¨rooms and facilities are maintained 
to a degree of adequacy that allows for a good learning environment.
 
 
Fa
cilities Improvement
 
During the 2013
-
2014 school year, routine maintenance was completed. Additionally, new lighting in the hallways was 
installed to improve visibility for evening events, and the Marcin parking lot was resurfaced to improve safety. One of
 
the 
kindergarten classrooms was improved through the removal of a wall to allow for more instructional space. All classrooms 
in buildings 7 & 8 received minor updates to their entrances to allow for wheelchair accessibility. The sound system in the 
cafete
ria was also repaired and improved. A variety of smaller improvements were made to promote safety in the event 
of a fire as a result of a comprehensive fire inspection that took place in November of 2014. During the 2015
-
2016 school 
year, the floor of the 
cafeteria was replaced. This was followed by modernization upgrades made to the walls of the 
cafeteria during the 2016
-
2017 school year. During the summer of 2017, the roofing on all original buildings on the campus 
was updated. Lighting in the cafeteria w
as improved in January of 2018. Underground piping for the HVAC system was 
improved and repairs were made to the south parking lot and basketball courts during the summer of 2018. During the 
summer of 2019, the AC/Heating systems were updated and modernize
d with the removal of the old Chiller system.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Calif
ornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternat
e achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for e
ntrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Hurley Elementary School. Campus
-
wide supervision ensures students 
are safe on school grounds before, during, and after school. Entrances to schoo
l grounds are secured during the school 
day. All visitors must sign in at the office and wear appropriate identification while on campus.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is designed to assist in maintaining a safe school environment and preparing for
 
emergencies. The plan requires identification of security needs, development of prevention and intervention techniques, 
evaluation of physical facilities, and communication with staff and students. The safety plan is reviewed annually, updated 
as needed, 
and fully compliant with federal and state regulations. The plan was discussed with staff in August of 2019 and 
brought to the SSC in October 2019 for approval. An updated copy is available to the public in the school office from the 
administrative team.

Each year, the District dedicates three full days to Staff Development. In addition, five days a year are designated as Early
 
Release days for staff development. The following areas of professional development have been provided to staff: 
professional lear
ning communities, PBIS, effective math and literacy instruction and other areas as indicated by school 
data.  Our district provides professional development based on data from both the district and school level to ensure that 
areas of need are being addres
sed.  Professional Development occurs at the district, school and classroom level dependent 
on teacher goals.  The district provides Teachers on Special Assignment at all grade levels to provide on
-
site coaching and 
support after professional development h
as occurred.
 
 

 

 
challenge and in compliance with the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, Visalia Unified offers a robust 
support and training system for these novice educators including differentiated professional development and continuous 
professional growt
h opportunities.  The professional learning system begins with the New Certificated Staff Summer 
Institute which is a five
-
day interactive training offered in August one week before school begins.  This training covers 
classroom management, classroom cultu
re, curriculum frameworks, and lesson design. In addition, a four
-
day workshop 
on student engagement and cooperative learning is offered during winter break so that teachers may implement new 
structures and strategies during the spring semester.  All novic
e teachers receive ongoing support and individualized 
training throughout the year via weekly meetings with their assigned mentor at their respective school sites.  Mentors 
and district teachers
-
on
-
assignment support implementation of new knowledge by prov
iding in
-
class coaching, 
collaborating on lesson design, accompanying novice teachers on classroom tours, and assisting with student data analysis 
to drive instructional decisions.  In addition, novice teachers and their mentors attend monthly after school
 
training in 
action research and are provided time to reflect on their instructional practice.   Mentors and teachers on assignment are 
carefully selected experienced educators trained in how to facilitate the individualized professional growth of novice 
t
eachers.  Novice teachers who have preliminary credentials participate in the VUSD Teacher Induction Clear Credential 
Program which is accredited by the Commission and is offered at no cost to the candidate.
 
 
Support for Veteran Teachers:  Veteran teachers
 
in need of classroom management assistance also have access to one
-
on
-
one mentor support as may be needed in the case of a new grade level assignment or challenging class.  Visalia Unified 
also offers a Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) program which is a 
formal system of mentoring and accountability.
