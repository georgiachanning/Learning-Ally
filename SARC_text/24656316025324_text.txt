By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Bellevue Elementary School is a TK
-
6 school serving approximately 690 students. It is located in the community of Atwater 
just off Highway 99. It is one of ten schools in the Atwater Elementary School District.
 
 
Bellevue is comprised of the foll
owing demographics:  85% Hispanic/Latino, 6% White, 2% African American, 2% Asian, 1% 
American Indian or Alaska Native, and 4% Filipino/Pacific Islander/Other.
 
 
Two major subgroups include Socioeconomically Disadvanted students at 94 % and English Language
 
Learners at 48%.  
Since the English Language Learner population is so high, teaching reading and promoting the use of academic language 
is a high priority. Bellevue prides itself on its high standards of success for all students.
 
 
Bellevue's Mission State
ment is the following:  "As part of the Atwater Elementary School District, Bellevue School is 
committed to providing a high quality academic core program in an educational environment that promotes each 

ial growth and that prepares each student to become a productive and 
responsible citizen".  Focusing on these areas supports the needs of Socioeconomically Disadvantaged students.
 
 
Students who are identified as needing remediation and additional support i
n English Language Arts and Math are targeted 
for academic intervention.   The administrative staff,school leadership team, and grade level Professional Learning 
Communities closely monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the academic program by re
viewing student work, 
observing teaching practices, analyzing assessment data, and providing direct feedback to staff, students and parents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Bellevue School has 35 classrooms, one library, one building for support personnel, one cafeteria and kitchen facility, and 
one office 
complex. Four custodians clean these facilities and restrooms daily and handle minor repairs. Sixteen primary 
classrooms have undergone major remodeling and a new fire alarm and intrusion system were installed.
 
 
During the summer of 2005, Bellevue School r
eceived modernization in the intermediate classrooms (4th
-
6th grades), the 
school office, and in bathrooms in order to be ADA compliant. At this time a school
-
wide expansion project brought an 
additional kindergarten building (which houses four classrooms)
, a new library, and six middle school classrooms were 
added.  A second project 

 
re
-
figuring the school parking lot, also completed in August of 2005, ensures a safer driveway, 
parking areas and bus loading zones for students, parents and staff.
 
 
A new sc
hool gym was built in the summer on 2012 and the installation of a centralized/computerized centrally controlled 
HVAC system was installed alongside with upgraded light fixtures to improve energy efficiency at the end of the 2013 
school year.  During the s
ummer of 2014 a new roof was built on sixth wing.  At the start of the 2016 school year a new 
school track was completed.
 
 
The main school parking lot was again reconfigured in 2018 to improve traffic flow.  New roofing was completed on the 
kindergarten an
d intermediate wing classrooms in the summer of 2019 as a part of the district maintenance plan.  These 
projects ensure the school provides safe, clean and adequate facilities.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There are continuing opportunities for parent involvement at Bellevue School, offered in both English and Spanish. Our 
School Site Council, which includes membership of staff and parents, oversees and develops the 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement. The E
nglish Language Advisory Council provides parents of English Learners a format for input and 
participation. Another committee with parent membership includes our parent volunteers, that work closely with our 
Student Leadership Team.  We offer Parent Knowle
dge Nights, Family Movie Nights, and other family events to encourage 
participation and involvement in school activities.  Parents volunteer regularly at the school in classrooms, the library, or
 
other school
-
organized events.  In collaboration with outsid
e organizations we offer many opportunities including but not
