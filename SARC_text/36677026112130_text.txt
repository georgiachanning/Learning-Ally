By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions 
and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
East Heritage Elementary provides a safe and clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance and 
campus supervision. Original school buildings were constructed in 1994. Ongoing maintenance 
ensures school facilities 
are kept safe, in good working condition, and continue to provide adequate space for students and staff.
 
 
East Heritage Elementary is proud of its high standards regarding campus maintenance and general housekeeping 
practices. Sta
ff and students enjoy the benefits of having a well
-
maintained and beautiful campus.
 
 
School staff and the maintenance department work together to ensure playgrounds, classrooms, and campus grounds are 
well
-
maintained. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) over
sees a work order process enabling school staff to 
communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. The school custodian and school 
secretary coordinate efforts to prepare and submit work orders to M&O for resolution. Emergen
cy situations are given 
high priority and resolved immediately by site or district custodial staff.

upcoming events, work orders (submitted and outstanding), and special requ
ests. Schools are required by state law to 
conduct a formal inspection annually of designated areas and systems and then prepare a report of the current condition 
of facilities.  The School Site Inspection table illustrated in this report identifies the st

ents arrive on campus. Any 
graffiti or signs of vandalism are removed immediately. Restrooms are checked twice a day as a proactive measure in 
keeping facilities stocked, safe, and sanitary.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The
 
SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative A
ssessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participat
e in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students wh
o have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

At East Heritage we 
believe parent engagement is crucial in attaining increased student achievement for all students. Our 
plan for parent engagement is strategically organized throughout the school year to ensure our parents feel welcome, 
valued, and stay informed about their
 

learning by attending school events, serving on a school committee, and volunteering at the school.  The staff welcomes 
parent assistance in the classroom, chaperoning fiel
d trips, supporting fundraising projects, PTO, and organizing school 
wide activities. Back to School Night, Open House, student performances, Family Nights, Parent Education Nights, and 
bookfairs provide opportunities for parents to interact with school st

Site Council (SSC), Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), and African American Parent and Educator Advisory Committee 
(AAPEAC) enable parents to provide oversight and input on the school budget, activitie
s, and educational programs. Our 
Watch D.O.G.S. program actively engages our dads by providing daily opportunities to volunteer and remain active on our 
campus.  Parents who would like to get more involved or volunteer their time in any school program may 
contact their 
child's teacher, the school office personnel, or a PTO representative at (909) 823

School Safety Plan (School
 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of our school site. All visitors to the campus must sign in at the offi
ce 
and wear a visitor pass at all times. Supervision is provided to ensure the safety of each student before 
school, during 
breaks, at lunch, and after school. Supervision is a responsibility shared among parent/guardian volunteers, teachers, and 
administrators. The school is always in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous mater
ials 
and state earthquake standards. Safety drills including fire, earthquake, and intruder on campus are held monthly. To 
further safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, a comprehensive School Site Safety Plan has been developed. The 
Comprehensive
 
School Site Safety Plan was originally developed for East Heritage Elementary in collaboration with local 
agencies and district administration to fulfill Senate Bill 187 requirements. Components of this plan include child abuse 
reporting procedures, teach
er notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for 
safe arrival and departure from school, sexual harassment policy, and dress code policy. The most current school safety 
plan was updated and reviewed by the school 
staff and safety committee in November  2019 and approved by School Site 
Council in December 2019.
