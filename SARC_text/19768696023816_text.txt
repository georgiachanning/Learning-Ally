School Description
 
Peter Burnett Elementary is one of three elementary schools located in the Wiseburn Unified 
School District (enrollment: 4,000) located just south of LAX.
 
 
Burnett serves 442 3rd
-
5th grade students: 41.1% qualify for FRPM: 16.6% are ELL, 21% identify as 
wh
ite; 59% Hispanic/Latino; 7% Black, 10% 2 or more races, and 2% Asian. There are 21 classroom 
teachers which include ELD, RSP, and SDC, counselors, credentialed music teachers, Assistant 
Principal and Principal. Since 2010, Burnett has been identified as a
 
Title 1 school and now 
implements a school
-
wide 1:1 Chromebook initiative.
 
 
At Burnett Elementary we strive to bring out our BEST in all we do. While our BEST acronym guides 
us within our positive behavior reinforcement system (B
-
be responsible, E
-
effort 
all the way, S
-
safety first, T
-
treat all with respect), it also stands for something more. As 21st century learners, 

students, teachers, and staff are all commit
ted to putting their BEST foot forward and are eager to 
jump into learning with an open and curious mind. We see a culture of continuous improvement in 
all aspects of school life at Burnett. Students are learning to be flexible in their thinking, valuing 
m
istakes as learning opportunities, and using one another as resources to enhance their learning.
 
 
The learning community at Peter Burnett is supported by all parents, teachers, students, and staff. 
Through our PTA and Wiseburn Education Foundation we are a
ble to provide our students with a 
curriculum that is well
-
rounded and rich with hands
-
on, engaging learning opportunities. Our 
community partnerships through local businesses such as Chevron, provide PLTW resources to help 
our students learn 21st
-
century 
science and engineering skills.
 
 
The staff continues to work together at improving our Professional Learning Community, whereby 
teachers and other support staff collaborate by using local assessments to improve student 
achievement. Our teachers at Burnett 
are also on a path of continuous growth and modeling to 
their students the growth mindset in action. Teachers are taking the time to collaborate and think 
critically as we introduce our new Language Arts series, Wonders, and continue to develop and 
enhance
 
our CGI curriculum. This process is showing our students that we are ALL lifelong learners 
and our capacity to be flexible and adapt and change over time, leads us to make deeper 
connections and insights into our learning.  In addition, students who requi
re more intensive 
support reading and language support receive intervention before or after school. Our students 
utilize programs such as Lexia, Literably, and Accelerated Reader 360 to strengthen students 
decoding, fluency, and comprehension skills.
 
 
In M
athematics, we continue to deepen our understanding of mathematical concepts and practices 
through the lens of Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI). The CGI philosophy emphasizes a student
-
centered approach to teaching mathematics that focuses on problem
-
s
olving, collaboration, and 
reflection. Students and teachers engage with concepts at a deeper level and utilize a wide variety 
of strategies to demonstrate their learning and understanding. Teachers are provided support 
through the Cotsen Foundation. Now i
n our fourth year, the focus has evolved to include training 
and support for all teachers in the area of CGI and to provide teachers with more opportunities to 
share practices with one another and look at student work to help guide instruction. In addition
, 
My Math is the adopted textbook used by teachers as a primary component of their math 
instruction. Both ST Math and Simple Solutions are supplemental resources that help build students 
knowledge in key math concepts.

A Multi
-
Tiered System of Support continues to be 
implemented to allow students to receive immediate and specific academic and 
behavioral assistance where needed.  Students are identified for intervention by test results, teacher recommendation, and sc
hool and 
district assessments. Our Student Study Team 
added new procedures for staff members to review supports for students and provide 
strategies for parents to support their children at home. These procedures include utilizing both formative and summative ass
essments, 
classroom observations, as well as, co
nsidering a student's social
-
emotional well
-
being to best determine the appropriate course of action 
for support. This process involves our school counselor,  intervention specialists, parents, and classroom teachers in collec
tively 
developing strategies t
o support positive student outcomes.
 
 
This success is evident in our students' 2018
-
19 test scores. Burnett students demonstrated growth school
-
wide in English Language Arts 
and closed the achievement gap in ELA and Math two years in a row. Burnett's scores reflect positive growth as our teach
ing practices 
aligned with the state standards and curriculum and instruction became more student
-
centered and interactive within the classroom. 
Teachers collaborate to reflect on and refine best practices and use local assessments (observations, surveys, 
student work) to improve 
student achievement. In the Spring of 2018, Burnett was awarded the honor as a California Distinguished School.
 
 
Being our BEST is a continuous process that involves compassion, collaboration, creativity, and community. The learnin
g community at 
Peter Burnett strives to reach those goals each and every day.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School A
ccountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Contr
ol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data rep
orted in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF o
r LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the

Parent participation and engagement are essential components to our success at Peter Burnett. The prominent marquee posted ne
ar the front entrance 
informs our school community about important upcoming events, as well as, sever
al areas where information is displayed and shared.  Weekly and 
monthly emails inform parents of the current events taking place within the school and highlight the strong partnership betwe
en District and community 
members.  Parents can join our School Sit
e Council, which works with the administration to develop goals and allocate resources to support our students 
and staff.  Parents of English Learners are vital to our English Language Advisory Committee and to outreach efforts on behal
f of new families.  
Teachers 
use parent volunteers to help with special projects in the classroom and to chaperone field trips.
 
 
The Wiseburn Education Foundation provides funding for programs that enrich our arts and music opportunities. Our PTA help st
aff members in 
classro
oms and supports programs throughout the school.   Parents participate in our annual Talent Show, Father/Daughter Dance, Moth
er/Son Game

Staff Development continues to play a pivotal role in the Wiseburn
 
Unified School District. In 2018
-
19, the focus for Peter Burnett Elementary and the 
District was the deep study of Cognitively Guided Instruction in Math. Teachers participated in three Staff Development days 
where they received training 
to support Distri
ct goals related to Math, aligning targeted instruction to the math standards and standards for mathematical practices.. Thro
ugh our 
continued partnership with Talking Teaching Network, the focus was on supporting teachers in their implementation of CGI st
rategies, and provide 
opportunities for increased collaboration within and across schools and grade levels. In addition, Burnett is utilizing the s
upport from a Math TOSA to 
support professional development in math across school settings.All teachers in gr
ades 3
-
5 participated in 3 lab days with a content expert in math to 
support unpacking the standards and developing cohesive lessons to support their daily math instruction. Teachers co
-
plan and co
-
deliver lessons with 
the site coach and debrief on student
 
work and outcomes to plan next steps in their instruction.
 
 
We also continued our focus on student
-
 
centered work as teachers utilize grade level reading assessments through the Accelerated Reader (AR) program. 
Teachers collect and review AR data four tim
es a year to monitor student progress in reading comprehension. Each Wednesday, students have an early 
dismissal to designate ample time for teacher, grade level and site level planning activities. From this, student strengths a
nd learning needs are identi
fied 
and strategies for improving delivery of services and instruction which are aligned to professional development groups. When 
planning staff training, 
teachers and administrators look at student work, test scores and review the most pressing issues of 
the previous year to choose specific topics to focus 
on and refine instruction.

We are in our third year or utilizing TCT (Teacher Collaboration Time) as a model to support grade level collaboration within
 
a specific content area. In 
2018
-

sed on the newly adopted ELA curriculum Wonders, NGSS and CGI strategies.  In 2019
-
 
20, we will continue the focus on 
understanding the math standards and SMP's (Standards for Mathematical Practices).With that in mind, we aspire in our TCT's t
o continuousl
y question, 
investigate, share learning, and act on it. This process takes place daily on an informal basis and one a month TCT meeting t
imes. Our principal takes the 
lead in creating a school
-
wide culture of inquiry and improvement. This is a professional
, nurturing, environment that encourages collaboration among 
staff and other stakeholders as we reflect on strengths and growth areas through analysis of self
-
assessments, feedback from peers, parents, and 
partners. Data collected is being used to develop 
a strategic site plan in professional development in the 2019
