By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card 
(SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan
 
(LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For mo
re information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP
, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
princip
al or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Sunnyslope's enrollment is at student capacity. Security is bolstered by the presence of a security resident who
 
lives on 
the property and inspects the property during nights and weekends to prevent vandalism and theft. In addition, 
surveillance cameras are located throughout the campus.
 
 
District Maintenance and Custodial staff take great care in ensuring that all 
schools are clean, safe, and functional. Lawns 
are mowed on Saturdays in an effort to minimize any classroom disturbances. Cleaning schedules are developed by the 
Principal and the Facilities Director to guarantee daily cleaning of campus. Restroom facilit
ies are inspected three times a 
day by the Head Custodian to ensure they are fully stocked and in full working order. Any needed repairs are addressed 
in a timely manner. Copies of inspections are available at the school and facilities offices.
 
 
The Head C
ustodian also performs a safety inspection on a monthly basis. The monthly report is submitted to the facilities 
office. Regular and preventative maintenance is ongoing. The district employs a computerized online work order system 
for efficiency and better
 
record keeping.
 
 
As per Education Code, the district is required to include in this document, a description of any needed maintenance to 
ensure good repair as specified in statute. "Good Repair" means the facility is maintained in a
 
manner that assures th
at it is clean, safe, and functional as determined pursuant to a Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT) 
developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction (OPSC). The FIT will evaluate the conditions at a 
school site with ratings of "good,
" "fair," or "poor." The FIT also provides an overall summary of the conditions at each 
school on a scale of "exemplary," "good," "fair," or "poor." The instrument shall not require capital enhancements beyond 
the standards to which the facility was design
ed and constructed.
 
 
OVERALL SUMMARY OF SCHOOL FACILITY GOOD REPAIR STATUS
 
At the time of the above inspection on August 13, 2019 the average ranking for Sunnyslope Elementary was 97.39%, giving 
the school a rating of "Good." The rating is determined by th
e average of the 15 categories addressed above. Below are 
the percentages, descriptions, and ratings, as per the Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT).
 
 
Please note that all needed repairs or deficiencies identified in the August FIT report have been completed 
and/or 
resolved.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4
):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [
CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, whic
h are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
South Bay Union School District has developed a Crisis Response Box for each of its school sites. Each box contains a 
comprehensive Emergency Procedural Guidelines binder specific to each site. The b
inder includes state required disaster 
procedures such as, but not limited to, bomb threat, earthquake, fire, medical emergency, missing student, and shootings. 
Evacuation maps, evacuation sites, key phone numbers, district/site communication plan, are jus
t a few of the elements 
included within the plan. School staff reviewed/revised the Safety Plan on October 9, 2019. School sites conduct various 
types of drills on a regular basis throughout the year and record the exercise on the Emergency Drills Record f
orm, which 
is submitted to the district office each December.

Based on student achievement data, reading comprehension is a primary area of focus for 
staff development. Professional 
development is delivered through a variety of methods and modalities, for example, after school workshops, individual 
mentoring, team PLC, release days and specialized conferences. Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) ar
e at the heart 
of all staff development, ensuring a deeper implementation of effective instructional strategies and driven by student 
achievement data. In addition, the South Bay Union School District academic calendar includes two full days for staff 
prof
essional learning and 37 minimum days that are dedicated to staff professional learning and/or professional 
collaboration. Sunnyslope School provides 26 minimum days for professional collaboration, and 11 minimum days for staff 
professional learning and de
velopment. The two full days are placed at the start of the academic school year, while the 
minimum days occur throughout the year.  Teachers receive coaching and specific feedback from the school principal, 
literacy and math TOSAS to support teachers in i
mplementing new instructional strategies learned and to improve their 
instructional practices in the classroom.  In addition, Sunnyslope is an affiliate school with Teacher's College Reading and 
Writing Project (TCRWP) and has contracted 10 days of on site
 
professional development and coaching with TCRWP staff 
developers.
