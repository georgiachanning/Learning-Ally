By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Montera Elementary believes we are a collaborative community of empowered learners.  We practices being safe, 
responsible and respectful as we focus on being college, career and life ready.  Here at Montera we proudly offer two 
prog
rams unique to our district.  Mandarin, duel immersion, and Inclusion, special education classes that model 
inclusionary practices.  We believe that every student can learn.  We strive to meet their unique needs by individualizing 
their school experience a
nd celebrating the diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds our students come with.
 
Teachers and support staff are provide many platforms to develop as professionals.  Student data, district, and state 
testing are the primary factors in guiding and dete
rmining staff development areas. Teachers work in grade level 

Professional development occurs throughout the school year including after
-
school workshops, conference attendance, 
individual mentoring, and after
-
school professional study meetings multiple times per month. Site administration 
facilitates grade level meetings, and provides support to teachers on an individual base by assisting 
in reading instruction, 
observing, and providing feedback via a weekly walk through.  All non
-
instructional support staff including clerical, 
custodial, and proctors meet with an Administrator each trimester in their respective groups to present informatio
n and 
for collaboration and training. The goals of these meetings are to contribute to a positive and collaborative school culture 
and to facilitate continuous improvement.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

instructional staff are provided with training opportunities through the district office as well as the school site. 
We focus on understanding what positive student interactions are, with a
n emphasis on positive reinforcement, student 
safety, responsibility, and respect.
 
 
District level professional development includes workshop sessions and classroom support for beginning teachers (BTSA), 
courses for teachers working towards their teaching 
credentials, support for veteran teachers through the Peer Assistance 
and Review program (PAR), technology training and classroom support, leadership development for administrators, 
compliance workshops, and a variety of job
