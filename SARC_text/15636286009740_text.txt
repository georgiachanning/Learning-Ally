By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-

Maricopa Unified School District has embarked on a mission to revitalize the district by adopting a new overarching 

xploring 
future trends for the year 2030 and beyond, analyzing student, community, and staff surveys and input, the staff 
cooperatively arrived at a focus on future Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics, and Science (TEAMS)! This will help 
our current
 
and future students to be prepared for participation in a changing global economy that extends far beyond 
the boundaries of their local community experience. A Visioning Task Force (teachers, classified staff, parent, 
administration, Board member) was ass
embled and met for two full
-
day meetings to discuss the TEAMS concept. The task 
force decided on a motto of, Maricopa Unified School District
-
Powered by TEAMS to guide, the T.E.A.M.S. approach.   The 
Task Force developed a draft strategic plan based future
 
trends to meet the needs of students and the community for the 

Tenets with the new TEAMS focus.
 
 
OUR VISION (Promise for Tomorrow

Maricopa Schools are TEAMS of adaptive learners, ready for future challenges and careers.  Using Technology, Engineering, 
Arts, Mathematics, and the Sciences (TEAMS), our students will solve real

learning, 
students are engaged, self
-
 
motivated, and self
-
directed. Students will gain technical expertise, balanced with 
collaborative communication skills to meet the everchanging demands of the future.
 
 
Staff are facilitators in learning to support student achiev
ement in all curriculum areas.  Staff enhance technology 
competence by working with students to design high content, engaging, and satisfying student work. This supports the 
project
-
based learning involving TEAMS philosophies.  Staff provides opportunities
 
for students to create learning 
interests through content curriculum integration and connections.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Board, 
administration, and staff recognize that parents and community play a vital role in the success of our school.
 
 
Maricopa Elementary School prides itself on involving the parents and community members in every aspect of our school. 
We welcome our parents on
 
our campus for many different reasons including student assemblies, and other special 
events. We believe that teachers cannot educate children alone without the active support and involvement of parents 
and community members.
 
 
The Maricopa Unified School 
District welcomes and encourages all parents to get involved at our three schools. Any 
teacher or administrator can be contacted for parental involvement. Parents may become involved in many ways,

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
A Safe School Plan has been developed for the school district, which is reviewed and updated annually by March 1 by the 
administration, staff, and School Site 

students and staff safe on school grounds as well as the safe ingress and egress of pupils.
 
 
Key Elements:
 
Emergency Numbers
 
Fire
 
Explosions
 
School Crime
 
Child Abuse 
Reporting
 
Dress Code
 
Safe Ingress/Egress
 
Earthquake
 
Active Intruder
 
Lockdown
 
Bomb Threat
 
Dangerous Pupils
 
Suspension / Expulsion
 
Harassment/Antibullying
 
 
The District has monthly fire drills, bi
-
annual earthquake/evacuation drills, and intruder drills. Sta
ff attend training and 
workshops on health and safety issues held by the district and county office of education
 
.
 
Students are supervised throughout the day by teachers, administration, and instructional aides. All visitors must sign in 
at the main office

the day. The district has a 24 hour surveillance camera system to support a safe and secure campus environment.
 
The District has implemented a Positive B
ehavior Intervention System (PBIS) program called "Time to Teach." Each year 
all staff members are trained in the program strategies for district
-
wide consistent implementation for student 
management. Administration and staff deal with campus student manag
ement in a firm, fair and consistent manner. Each 
situation is considered important and is dealt with in a timely manner. Being a small campus, few major discipline issues 
take place each year. The campus is a safe place for our students and staff.
