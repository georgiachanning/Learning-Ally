By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievem
ent (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternat
e Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement 
standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the
 
University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At La Veta Elementary School, there are multiple ways that parents are involved in their child's education.  The La Veta 
PTA is an established unit of parents who plan and implement family activities and fundraisers to support the instructional 
needs of th
e students.  Parents also support their children's learning by volunteering in the classroom, or by volunteering 
in our weekly Viking Volunteer program.  The Viking Volunteers meet every Wednesday to help prepare materials for 
teachers and students.  They 
help support the instructional program while they are meeting and getting to know other 
parent volunteers. The School Site Council (SSC) is another opportunity to work collaboratively with the principal and 
school staff . The SSC writes and approves the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement, the Safety Plan and all items regarding 
the site budget and school goals. Lastly, the English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) consists of parents who have a 
student that is an English Learner.  The ELAC discusses the n
eeds of English Learners and their parents while informing the 
members of curricular and budget decisions pertinent to their children. There are many opportunities to be involved in 
any of these groups and we welcome the volunteer support our parents provi
de. To participate in organized parent 
involvement opportunities, please contact the school at 714

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Each school within the Orange Unified School District (OUSD) develops and adopts, in accordance with Education Code § 
32280 

 
32289, a Comprehensive Safe School Plan (CSSP) specific to their site. Each school site is required to annually 
review and update 
their CSSP. Each school forwards the CSSP to the district through the office of Student and Community 
Services. The office of Student and Community Services provides assistance to the schools in developing the plan and 
maintains a file of individual school
 
plans available for inspection by the public.
 
 
Our CSSP, integrated with the District Safe Plan, is reviewed and updated yearly by the Instructional Leadership Team, 
staff, ELAC, PTA, and approved by SSC.
 
 
La Veta's CSSP was last updated and reviewed in F
ebruary 2019. The current goals include: 1. Implement a Character 
Education plan that includes John Wooden's Pyramid of Success and Harper for Kids resources; 2. Promote regular 
attendance and arriving to school on time by providing incentives and positive
 
reinforcements; 3. Conduct regular drills 
for each type of emergency.

La Veta Elementary staff will implement a Pyramid of Excellence which will provide high quality best first instruction to all
 
students, supplemental academic and behavioral supports to students in need of targeted intervention, individualized 
academic and 
behavioral supports to students in need of intensive intervention, and supplemental enrichment 
opportunities for advanced learners.

Pyramid of Excellence not only provides academic and behavioral interventions, it also focuses on tiered enrichment 
opportunities for all stude
nts. This model can be thought of as a three
-
dimensional pyramid comprised of 3 faces: 
Response to Instruction and Intervention (RTII), Positive Behavioral Intervention and Support (PBIS), and enrichment for 
advanced learners.
 
 
Through the Pyramid of Excel
lence underperforming student subgroups (English Learners, Hispanic, Students with 
Disabilities and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged) are targeted for Tier 2 and Tier 3 academic and behavioral interventions 
as needed.  Tier 2 interventions include in
-
class 
small group instruction, differentiated instruction, in
-
class intervention 
software, social skills group lessons, periodic parent conferences regarding academics and/or behavior, School Attendance 
Review Team (SART) meetings.   Tier 3 interventions include
