By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

cooperation, courtesy, and acceptance of others. Parents and students are informed of school rules and discipline policies 
through the student h
andbook which is sent home at the beginning of the school year. The school
-
wide expectations at 

rules assemblies are conducted monthly to rev
iew rules and procedures and to celebrate students who show the "Wildcat 
Way". Northridge students are taught to recognize, refuse, and report bullying behaviors. Each month, students are 
rewarded for perfect attendance and for showing our Successful Pract
ices.
 
 
Students at Northridge also participate in our House System. The purpose of the Northridge House System is to promote 
a positive and welcoming environment in which students, staff and community members feel a strong sense of belonging. 
This supports
 
the Northridge mission of valuing every student and empowering student leaders. Through the Northridge 
House System, students are taught the Essential 25. Learning these essentials offers opportunities to learn and practice 
social emotional skills to prep
are for college and career readiness. Students will become intrinsically motivated to do their 
best and take responsibility for creating and sustaining a positive environment for our community. 
 
 
PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE
 
Welcome to the 2019
-
2020 School year, Wi
ldcats!
 
 
We are looking forward to another year of laughter, teaching, and learning. Our teachers and staff have been busy getting 
our campus ready for everyone and we are excited to see all our Wildcats back again in just a few days!
 
 
We are excited to we
lcome new staff members joining our Northridge team. Please welcome the following teachers and 
staff when you see them on campus: Mrs. Lydia Truitt (K/1st grade), Mrs. Mary Durbrow (1st grade), Mr. John Naranjo 
(5th grade), Mrs. Carissa Enriquez (6th grade
) and Mrs. Jill Soto (ELD). 
 
 
In addition to new staff members, we are excited to open up our newly remodeled Kindergarten Playground! 
 
 
This year, we have a big surprise in store for our students, staff and families! As a school staff, we are 
committed to 
building a community in which we value every student, empower student leaders and cultivate academic and personal 
growth. As a way to embrace these beliefs, we will be rolling out a Northridge House System this year, similar to that 
found in H
arry Potter. In the fall, your student/s will be assigned a house with 60 other students across grade levels. Each 
house has a specific character trait, color, and animal to represent their house and will hold 8
-
9 adult mentors from across 
campus. Students
 
will work towards earning points for their house and the house with the most points per trimester will 
be declared the Winning House and will be treated to a field trip off site! Your student/s will participate in weekly house 
meetings as well as monthly 
house rallies. All house events occur every Friday from 8:55
-
9:25 and families are welcome 
to join in the fun! We hope you will consider stopping by during a house event. 
 
 
If you have not already done so, please consider joining us on social media, where 
you will receive updates on upcoming 
events as well as pictures posted of our Wildcat adventures throughout the day. You can find us at @NRWildcats on 
Instagram and Twitter and join our family page on Facebook at Northridge Elementary or the closed group, 


 
 
As your site principal, please know that I am committed to ensuring that all families and students feel welcome and safe

ble. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at t
he district office prior 
to adoption. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the quality, currency, and availability of

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Northridge Elementary was modernized in 1995, and a new multi
-
purpose room was added in 2001. The scope for 
modernization included roof/repair or replacement, interior, and exterior painting, selected window system replacement, 
energy
-
efficient lighting sy
stem upgrade, new doors with handicapped accessible hardware, restroom restoration, 
electrical infrastructure upgrade to provide for internet, cable, telephone, new fire/intrusion, and intercom system 
throughout the school.  Currently there is sufficient s
pace to house the student population. There is a site custodial staff 
that cleans the building, along with district support for major/minor repairs. The district provides gardening and landscape 
services on a regular schedule. Regular fire/emergency drills
 
are held, and badges are required for all visitors and 
personnel.   Complete HVAC system installed in Summer 2007 (Measure
-
J). The exterior was painted in 2009 with Deferred 
Maintenance funds.
 
 
The pod B and pod C interior student restrooms were remodeled
 
in Summer 2012 (Measure
-
J).  At the same time the pods 
interior drainage and cement work was replaced and  cement work in front of the office was improved (Measure
-
J).
 
 
The Board of Education and the Superintendent's policy is to ensure that all 
students are provided with a safe and well
-
maintained learning environment. The board approved resolutions in 1998 and 2002 to adequately fund maintenance 
activities and preserve the repairs and improvements funded by two facility bond measures. The school
 
buildings, 
classrooms and grounds are safe, clean and functional. An inspection of the facility was conducted in August 2019 and 
determined that there were no unsafe conditions that required emergency repairs. District maintenance staff ensures 
that the r
epairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
computer automated work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs and health and 
safety repairs are given the highes
t priority. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards and custodial staffing 
requirements for all schools in the district. This school meets the Board's standards for custodial staffing and cleanliness.
 
The school's custodians are trained in th
e proper use of cleaning chemicals and Integrated Pest Management techniques. 
They are managed day to day by the Principal with assistance from the district's maintenance department. The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Progra
m, with funding allocated for major repair or replacement 
of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. Annually the dist
rict budgets $2 million dollars for deferred 
maintenance activities.

Professional development is a key part of the continuous improvement process for educators. The goal of our quality 
professional development is to support the learning of teachers and paraprofessionals to positively impact student 
achievement.  Annually, t
eachers and site administrators participate in professional development in a variety of 
opportunities.  Seventy
-
five minutes per week are dedicated to staff collaboration and training planned by site leadership 
teams. The District also provides a cycle of 
continuous professional development for Administrators through Principal 
Networks as well as Leadership Academies.
 
 
The District provides professional development opportunities for teachers and administrators that support the 
implementation of Common Core 
State Standards in English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and the 
ELA/ELD Framework.  Specific professional development initiatives include: Culturally Responsive Practices, Critical 
Literacy, TK
-
2 Reading, Supporting Independence and
 
Engagement through Reading and Writing, Math to the Core, 
Expository Reading and Writing Course, and ELD Foundations.  District departments, Center for Teacher Support, grant
-

ing opportunities.  Professional 
development opportunities are voluntary for teachers and are provided throughout the year in a variety of formats: during 
the school day, after school, on Saturdays, and during summer and vacation breaks. Many teachers and 
administrators 
also take advantage of opportunities with Sacramento County Office of Education, California Department of Education, 
the college/university programs, state/national education organizations, and private educational institutes.
 
 
What grounds t
he professional development in the district is the District Strategic Plan and the Local Control 
Accountability Plan. Professional Development is further determined using one or more of the following: (a) student 
achievement data, (b) staff survey data, an
d (c) district
-
identified goals.  Professional development addresses the Common 
Core State Standards, teaching strategies, curriculum, assessment, technology, classroom management, safety, and 
leadership. Administrator training accompanies professional dev
elopment in district focus areas, providing 
implementation support for teachers on site.  Content
-
area coaches are available at some schools.  Additional classroom 
support is provided to new and struggling teachers by consulting teachers from the Center fo
r Teacher Support.

Paraprofessionals are encouraged to participate in professional development at the district and site level.  Specifically 
designed training is also offered to non

instructional support staff such as clerical and custodial staff that inc
ludes both 
operational and instructional topics.
