School Description
 
School Description
 
 
Ruhkala Elementary School is one of seventeen schools in the Rocklin Unified School District. The 
school serves students from preschool through sixth grade, with an enrollment of approximately 
400. The school is located in the center of a dynamic and suppo
rtive community which expresses 
its values toward education through a high level of participation. Ruhkala Elementary School 
opened in 2005. Roger Stock is District Superintendent and Lara Kikosicki is Principal.
 
 

s, and parents make up an exemplary community of 
learners. The focus is on the development of lifelong learning skills in a caring, exciting environment 
which fosters self
-
esteem and individual development. A great deal of value is placed on the many 
ways 
to approach learning and the different experiences and opinions each person brings to the 
learning process. The staff recognizes that making learning meaningful to the student enhances the 
learning. Therefore, subjects are presented in thematic or integrat
ed units whenever possible.
 
 
Along with the academics, emphasis is also placed on the development of student responsibility, 
initiative and character education. Ruhkala uses a tiered system to support students with behavior 
through a Positive 
Behavior, Intervention, and Support school (PBIS) and academics through an 
intervention and extension model.
 
 
Parents play an important role at Ruhkala Elementary School through active participation and 

Club (PTC) and as classroom volunteers. They 
share information with classes about professional lives, teach special skills (art, music, and sports), 
work on school or playground improvements, conduct fundraisers and make donations. Parents 
regularly volunt
eer their services in the classrooms. Ruhkala Elementary School has become a focal 
point and center for students and the community. Our facilities are used frequently by our 
community.
 
 
Ruhkala Elementary is a California Distinguished School. It has also b
een recognized as a Scholar 
School by the California Business for Educational Excellence Foundation for the past four years. 
Ruhkala recently received a gold award from the PBIS coalition.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
The mission of Ruhkala Elementary, a community o
f inspired leaders, is to ignite the passion in each 
individual student for learning and leading through engaging innovative opportunities, challenging 
education experiences, and cohesive partnerships with families.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.
