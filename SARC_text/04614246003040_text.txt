By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 2019
 
 
Neal Dow is continuing the use of data that is generated by the reports in IReady, Accelerated Reading, Lexia, and STAR 
Early Literacy to track student growth and achievement. Progress monitoring helps plot a student's progress toward goals 
set. Learning p
rogressions assist in identifying skills needed in the next lessons.
 
 
Our curriculum focus has undergone some significant changes in recent years. Common Core State Standards have 
become the key ingredient of our teaching, while writing ties all of langu
age arts together as stated in our belief that 
writing is a way of developing thinking skills, of generating ideas, and of helping one to survive in an increasingly dynamic
 
and complicated society.
 
 
During the 2019
-
2020 school year our staff will continu
e to focus on having all children reading at grade level by jr. high. 
Time for staff to assess curriculum and articulate across tracks and grade levels is accomplished through staff collaboration
 
during release time during the day and called timed after sc
hool. Staff efforts in developing a Professional Learning 
Community will continue, especially in the area assessment through Illuminate and IAB assessments to drive instruction.
 
 
Updated and readily available resources are important if students are to pe
rform at their best in class. The State of 
California adopts textbooks that meet quality standards established by the State Board of Education. The Chico Unified 
School District selects textbooks and other instructional materials from these state adoptions
. All of the textbooks 
currently in use meet these standards. They were selected to match the needs of Chico students by a Task Force comprised 
of teachers and administrators and approved by the Board of Education. The Chico Unified School District convene
s 
curricular task forces to review textbooks in core subject areas on the Kindergarten through 8th grade state adopted list 
concurrent with the adoption cycle. These standards aligned textbooks are in the hands of all students within two years 
of adoption.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Neal Dow School was built in 1964 and is currently under renovations that are scheduled to be completed in the spring of 
2020. We have two Special Day Class prog
rams, one room is for a Mod/Severe class and another for the Resource 
Specialists program. The Guidance Counselor, the PIP program, Speech Therapist, School Psychologist and Nurse are all 
located in our newly renovated administrative offices.  Our mission 
is to have every child reading by the end of third grade, 
and we provide interventions for students who are struggling academically in the form of daily RTI and a school based 
Learning Center. In addition to the regular classroom space, small group reading
 
and workstations are available for 
individual or small group support. Adequate playground space, equipment and fields are available for outside activities 
including a new playground structure and two new basketball courts. Teachers have both a staff room 
and work room to 
prepare materials and work. Although our campus is still under renovations, it is still attractive, clean, safe, and function
al. 
Our custodians and district maintenance staff ensure that repairs necessary to keep the school in good working
 
order are 
completed. Each building has adequate restroom facilities.
 
 
The school makes an effort to keep students safe on school grounds by offering a breakfast program, homework help and 
playground supervision before school; classroom instruction, superv
ised learning activities, and playground supervision 
during the school day; and bus and playground supervision after school. School personnel and volunteers wear 
identification badges, everyone visiting the school must check in at the office, and volunteer
s are required to fill out 
qualifying forms. During the school day, door lock blocks are used and gates to the campus are locked. During the 2019
-
2020 school year, our school is able to offer four hours of supervised help with homework, academic instructio
n, 
recreation and enrichment. American Disability Act compliance construction improved the entry point in two places along 
the sidewalk in front of the school. The Handicap parking area was renovated and received new striping to make the 
parking locations 
more visible.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information 
relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general ed
ucation population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs
 
items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses tha
t satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Site Council has developed a Safe School Plan, which consists of four components: tolerance for diversity; 
well
-
maintained and attractive school site; appropriate behavior; and safe and nurturing environment. Our plan stresses 
prevention; our goal is to be prepared. Ongoing training and drills allow us to increase our ability to deal with conflict an
d 
other thr
eats to safety. We have established a crisis response team, an emergency phone tree, and specific emergency 
plans. Neal Dow has received training and will be implementing the Catapult Emergency Management System to make 
reporting and managing emergency inc
idents more efficient. This year, our School Safety Plan was approved by the School 
Site Council on Sept. 11, 2019.
 
 
A disaster plan includes emergency procedures in case of Traumatic Incidents, Imminent Danger
--
Code Red, 
Evacuation/Relocation, Civil Defen
se/Disorder, Bomb Threat/Bomb Emergency, Earthquake, Chemical Spill, Crime in 
Progress,Shots Heard or Fired, and Fire/Explosion.
 
 
In an effort to ensure student safety while traveling to and from school, a crossing guard is located at the corner of Fifth 
A
venue and Downing. A walkway was constructed leading from the campus to the gate on Downing Avenue, and the gate 
is opened morning and afternoon to ease congestion at the front of the school. One
-
way traffic takes place in the school's 
parking lot, a cross
walk has been marked, and a drop
-
off zone for students has been established.
