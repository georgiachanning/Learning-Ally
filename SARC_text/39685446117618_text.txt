By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

 
 
Tom Hawkins Elementary School is a tr
ansitional kindergarten (TK) through eighth
-
grade school within the Jefferson 
School District. Our school is a unique learning community where teachers, parents, students, and administrators enjoy 
the mutual respect and care essential to growth and learnin
g. Our school is a place where students not only feel cared for 
and safe, but academically challenged as well. Students develop the knowledge, skills, relationships and character 
necessary to be successful beyond their school years, and they leave Tom Hawk
ins prepared to be lifelong learners. We 
encourage our students to excel in all areas of their development including art, music, leadership, character and athletics. 
Our professional staff is committed to high academic and behavioral standards, assisting s
tudents in reaching their goals, 
and ongoing staff development to enrich their teaching expertise and research
-
based repertoire of teaching practices. We 
are committed to ensuring all of our students are college and career ready and armed with 21st
-
century
 
skills by infusing 
technology and digital literacy in all of our classrooms. The Character Education program focuses around 10 pillars of 
character: Safety, Respect, Compassion, Sportsmanship, Cooperation, Perseverance, Trustworthiness, Creativity, 
Leader
ship and Excellence. Students also receive weekly social
-
emotional learning instruction using research
-
based 
Second Step curriculum.
 
 
What makes Hawkins a unique educational experience is the focus on student
-
centered events. On the first day of school, 
th
e staff greet students with a red
-
carpet welcome. There are many student events throughout the year, such as 
Walk/Bike to School Day, Day of the Writer, spelling bee, Fun Fridays, dances, rallies, Fund Run, Jump Rope for Heart, 
Halloween Parade, Hawkapaloo
za Music Festival, Red Ribbon Week, artist in residence, Family Science Night, Science and 
Math Olympiad, science fair, talent show, Read Across America, and College Week. It is our belief that school should foster 
the passion of students in multiple disci
plines beyond academia. We greatly value writing, science, art, music, leadership 
and athletics. The Hawkins community greatly values field
-
trip experiences. All grade levels take at least one field trip per 

ties go beyond the classroom.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Hawkins Elementary School began as a portable campus, and the permanent campus opened in the fall of 2002. The 
campus has a 
large athletic gym, and a library. We continue to purchase books and resources for the library to further 
enhance student learning and encourage a lifelong love of reading.
 
 
The campus has grown in size throughout the years. Construction of 10 additional c
lassrooms for sixth, seventh and eighth 
graders was completed in August 2005. Students and staff help keep the campus clean and litter
-
free. The Associated 
Student Body Officers also lead campus wide recycling each week. Three full time custodians take gre
at pride in 
maintaining organized, clean and safe facilities. There are three playgrounds on campus: kindergarten, primary and 
intermediate. A new playground structure was installed in July 2017. A team of student and parent volunteers stenciled 
and painte
d games on the Primary blacktop as part of the implementation of a recess program called Peaceful Playground. 
The staff is deeply committed to guaranteeing student safety. The Peaceful Playground program was implemented and 
has greatly improved the quantit
y and diversity of games being played on the playground.  As well as greatly reduced 
playground discipline. We continue to add playground equipment to ensure students will have multiple options for 
activity. Each playground is well supervised during recess
 
and lunch. Six campus aides supervise students during lunchtime. 
Although some students are bused to and from school, this is a neighborhood school. Most students walk, ride their bikes 
or are driven to school by their parents.
 
 
During the 2012
-
13 school 
year, Measure J bond money allowed for the construction of a track and field for all students 
to use during their physical education classes and recess time. Measure J also provided funding to improve campus 
lighting, interior courtyard modernization, a gy
m divider, grades 6
-

for student use. In the summer of 2017, character trait banners were installed on flagpoles to highlight the focus traits. 
The administrative office and staff workroom were modernized
 
in 2019.
 
 

custodial team ensures the school facilities comply with all federal and state health and safety regulations. A scheduled 
m
aintenance program is administered by Jefferson School District to ensure all classrooms, restrooms and facilities are 
well maintained and in good repair. Jefferson School District is firmly committed to providing and maintaining a safe and 
healthy work en
vironment.
 
 
In order to achieve this goal, Jefferson School District has developed an Injury and Illness Prevention Program for all 
employees to follow. It is designed to increase training and minimize workplace accidents, injuries and illnesses. By making
 
safety a high priority for every employee, we can reduce injuries and illnesses, increase productivity, and promote a safer 
and healthier environment for all individuals at Jefferson School District. Staff members receive yearly training for EpiPen 
use, d
iabetes, mandated reporting, sexual harassment, and bullying prevention.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety procedures and routines are reviewed with staff, students and parents. Key elements of the plan include providing 
for the safety and welfare of its students and staff, especially in a disaster situation, and to work cooperati
vely with other 
community agencies to prepare for and effectively deal with a disaster situation in our community. Our major goals are 
to save lives, protect property, and give aid to those in need in the event of a disaster. We hold practice drills monthl
y to 
ensure all staff, students and parents are aware of the necessary procedures to follow should a disaster or emergency 
arise. The Safety Committee meets to update and revise the School Safety Plan annually.
 
 
The school safety plan was last reviewed, up
dated and discussed with the school faculty in September 2019.

We encourage teachers to attend outside conferences and workshops to further their education and stay current in recent 
educational research. Minimum days are scheduled throughout the year for 
teachers to participate in ongoing staff 
development at both the site and district levels. Professional development methods include: after school workshops, 
conferences, and individual mentoring and coaching, and professional learning communities. Grade le
vel collaboration 
teams also worked together to develop Essential Standards, Learning Targets, and assessments.  Teams meet regularly to 
reviewed student assessment data and plan instruction and intervention accordingly.
