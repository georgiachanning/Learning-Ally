By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

365 K
-
6 students from all over the city of Pomona and Diamond Bar attend Pantera in grades Kindergarten through grade 
6. Departing sixth grader
s transition to Lorbeer Middle School and then to Diamond Ranch High School. All three schools 
perform exceptionally well on crucial state testing. Additionally, the area principals meet regularly to align their programs
 
to foster maximum academic and pers
onal success for all students.
 
 
Vision 

 
the vision of Pantera Elementary School is to prepare each student with the skills necessary to become successful 
21st century citizens.
 
 
Mission 

 
the mission of Pantera Elementary School is to provide an exception
al educational experience that focuses on 
the core curriculum enriched by visual and performing arts, physical education, technology, and character values for each 
student.
 
 
Message from the Principal
 
At Pantera, high priority is placed on academic 
achievement. Since Pantera opened, we have consistently ranked in the 
top 10% of all California public schools according to the Academic Performance Index. Our dedicated and creative teachers 
work hard to deliver the best possible classroom instruction. Mo
st of them hold advanced degrees and all of them attend 
ongoing professional development. Additionally, they collaborate at grade level, school level and district level meetings 
to align and balance their instructional programs.
 
 
To maintain and improve ou
r student success, we continuously evaluate our curriculum and are constantly looking for 
new ways to update and improve our strategies. Our curriculum has transitioned to the use of the Common Core Standards 
in English Language Arts and Math with emphasis
 
on academic vocabulary, informational text, and rigor. This sets the 
stage to help them absorb a diverse range of knowledge.
 
 
We believe this also enables them to master grade
-
level proficiency standards, but most importantly, excel at a level 
appropriate
 
to their individual ability. Additionally, technology has been integrated into the curriculum at all grade levels. 
In this arena, our objective is to provide our students with marketable skills. To keep our technology program fresh, our 
staff receives fre
quent training to keep current with real
-
world computer advancements.

Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
In addition to our focus on academics, the routines, structure and physical surroundings that are in place here create a 
total educational setting. We place a priority on providing a safe, secure environment. Our safety procedures are the 
cumulative result
 
of input from government resources, district guidelines, safety consultants and the efforts of our own 
administration, staff and community support groups and appear in our Comprehensive School Safety Plan. This plan is 
reviewed and updated annually and th
e information within is presented as appropriate during a September School Safety 
Assembly. The material covers a variety of subjects, including policies on disaster preparedness, student discipline, the 
components of a safe and orderly school environment,
 
including suspension/expulsion procedures, child abuse reporting 
procedures, student dress codes, and sexual harassment. Our children are provided with consistent rules, regulations and 
policies. Safety fundamentals are presented to each grade level durin
g the September Safety Assembly and reviewed 
throughout the school year as an intrinsic component of daily classroom activities, through general and focused assemblies 
and through regularly scheduled practice drills. We also make sure that each concept is 
clearly described and understood 
by our students. This way each child is confident with what our expectations are and what they would need to do in the 
event of an emergency or conflict. Our staff and volunteers are highly trained and well aware of what th
eir roles are as 


 
and 

incorporated into daily life and/or reviewed systematically, our children and adults are prepared to smoothly respond 
with appropriat
e decisions or learned routines to ensure the best possible outcome to any threat, be it a national 
emergency or a potential playground fight. Exact information about the tenets that we follow can be found in our 
Comprehensive School Safety Plan which is r
eviewed annually and approved by the school safety committee in March 
2016.
