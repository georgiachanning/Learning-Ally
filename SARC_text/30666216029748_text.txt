Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

32289, a Comprehensive 
Safe School Plan particular to their site. Each school site is required annually, by March 1st, to have reviewed, and if 
necessary, updat
ed their Safe School Plan. Each school forwards its Safe School Plan to the district through the office of 
Student and Community Services, which provides plan development assistance to the schools and maintains a file of 
individual school plans available f

A comprehensive disaster plan is in effect and fire and/or earthquake drills are conducted monthly. All schools in the 
district are linked through an emergency radio contact system, and radio drills are held periodically to be
 
prepared in case 
of an actual disaster. Providing a safe environment for our students is of paramount concern at California Elementary 
School. California Elementary School has an extensive disaster preparedness plan. Playground supervision is provided by 
certificated staff and noon supervisors to ensure student safety. All gates are locked during the day and visitors report 
through the office to sign
-
in and receive a pass.  Parent groups, as well as the school faculty and staff have opportunities 
to give f
eedback and input into updating the Safe School Plan annually to ensure everyone's safety and well being on the 
campus.

Below are the Academic and Behavioral Interventions provided for students at California ES:
 
 
Academic 
Interventions:
 
California has an extensive Multi Tiered System of Support (MTSS).  We have a block schedule with staggered intervention 
time that allows our Resource Specialist to push into grades K
-
3 to provide targeted Reading support. Students grade K
-
5
 
utilize one
-
to
-
one iPads to provide a customized learning pathway for all students.  In addition, students in grades K
-
5 take 
their iPads to and from school with the purpose of extending the learning time and providing equitable access to 
technology.  Stu
dents utilize Lexia Core 5, a research based software based Reading Intervention program, during the 
school day for 80 minutes a week and an additional 40 minutes a week as homework.  Teachers utilize the data on a daily 
basis to provide targeted intervent
ion to students.  Our "Mind The Gap" data team consisting of the principal, Instructional 
Coach, Resource Specialist, and RSP teacher meet weekly to an analyze the intervention data, shift resources as needed, 
follow up with teachers of struggling students
, and determine immediate response to next levels on the MTSS.  In addition 
to the Mind the Gap meetings and an established Student Study Team (SST) referral process, California holds  three CAST 
meetings annually with all teachers to discuss students that
 
have not responded to interventions and make referrals to 
SST meetings. From the SST process and direct Special Needs referrals, referrals are systematically made for Special Needs 
testing and conducted within legal timelines.
 
 
Behavioral Interventions:
 
C
alifornia ES implements Positive Behavioral Intervention Systems (PBIS) school
-
wide and has completed all three levels 
of training through the Orange County Department of Education.  In addition to clearly establish school
-
wide expectations 
we have a schoo
l
-
wide positive reinforcement system in place, a Check In Check Out (CICO) system for Tier Two students, 
customized Behavioral Intervention Plans (BIP) for general education students, and social skills classes for social 
pragmatics and a separate social sk
ills class for aggressive behavior.  We have a .2 Counselor that meets with students 
referred for Mental Health Services.  In addition, our part
-
time Community Liaison and our .2 Counselor provide parents 
with community resources to aid students in need of
 
additional Mental Health Services.

At California ES we implement Coaching cycles in which teachers receive training based on the
mes and instructional 
strategies focusing on school
-
wide best practices during pull out PD, Modified Wednesday PD, and/or virtual learning.  
Our Instructional coach meets with teachers the day after the training to reflect on the previous coaching cycle, r
eflect on 
the PD, and establish goals for the current cycle.  Over the next coaching cycle, which lasts from 3
-
6 weeks, the 
Instructional Coach pushes into the classroom and models the strategies of the PD in the teachers' classes, comes back 
and implement
s the strategies alongside with the teacher, and visits again when the teacher demos the strategies 
independently with their students.
 
 
During the 2019
-
2020 school the focus of the Coaching Cycles is on providing differentiated small group Math Instruction
 
utilizing a Blended Learning model.
 
 
We implement Modified Wednesdays in which we "bank" instructional minutes on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and 
Friday to release students earlier on Wednesday so teachers may expand their professional growth from 1:30 PM 
-
 
3:00 
PM.  Teachers are involved in site based professional learning one Wednesday a month, district based PD one Wednesday 
a month, Professional Learning Community meetings one Wednesday a month, and classroom preparation one 
Wednesday a month. The focus
 
of the district Professional Learning is on integrating of the new ELA Wonders adoption.  
The focus of the site Professional Learning is on deepening Mathematical practices.  The focus of Professional Learning 
Communities is on sharing best practices, ana
lyzing student achievement data, developing best 1st instruction, and 
interventions.
