By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Musick was built in several phases beginning in 1956 with modernization through 2003. With the passing of the bond and 
Prop 39, the District has begun assessing all sites to address c
oncerns.
 
District maintenance staff ensures that minor maintenance, repairs or upgrades necessary to keep the school in good 
repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. Monthly inspections are performed which includes general, 
electrical, me
chanical and playground safety. A work order system is used to ensure efficient service and emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority.
 
The school has two full time custodians, including a senior day custodian as well as a night custodian. Custodial 
staff work 
year round to maintain a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information 
relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general ed
ucation population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs
 
items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses tha
t satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Newark Unified School District has a tremendous amount of parent and community support, and there are many groups 
that provide support to the schools, students, and programs in the district. The Musick Parent, Teacher Association (PTA) 
is engaged in fundra
ising, open houses, and celebration festivities that support families in seeking connections with our 
school. Parents and community members are encouraged to volunteer as tutors, classroom helpers, and teacher and 
student partners. There are also opportuni
ties that
 
offer
 
family outreach programs/classes. In addition to parents, AARP 
(Association of American Retired Persons) members volunteer in the classrooms. Community members and parents have 
the opportunity to be directly involved with the governance of 
the school through serving on one of the many leadership 
teams that guide the district, including: 
 

 
School/District English Learner Advisory Committees
 

 
PTA
 

 
School Site Council
 

 
Classroom volunteering
 

 
Office volunteering for special projects
 
Please contact t
he school office for more information on opportunities for parent involvement.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety
 
is our #1 priority. When students feel safe at school, they can focus on learning. Staff monitors the school grounds 
ten minutes before and fifteen minutes after school and at all recesses and lunchtimes. Teachers supervise after school 
for 15 minutes whi
le students wait for their parents or guardians. Noon Supervisors monitor recess and lunchtime to 
ensure that students are safe and respectful to each other. Teachers regularly review the rules for safe, responsible 
behavior in school and on the playground
 
with their classes.
 
 
Visitors are directed to enter and exit the campus through the front office door and sign in and out. They receive a white 
one time use stick
-
on tag to wear throughout their stay. We review being safe from dangerous incidents, as well
 
as lock
-
down procedures with staff and students, and publish our drill purpose and plan on DOJO and our Website.

Musick revises our Disaster Preparedness Plan annually. The Safety Plan was last revised in the spring of 2020. The plan 
includes procedures 
for emergencies, exit routes, and inventories of emergency supplies.  We share the plan with all staff 
during a school
-
wide staff meeting. We practice fire drills every month and earthquake drills and lockdown drills 
bimonthly.  All personnel has a disaste
r assignment: supervise children, search and rescue, first aid, record keeping, 
communication, etc.  We are well prepared!
