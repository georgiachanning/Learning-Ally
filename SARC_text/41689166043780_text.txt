School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Fernando Rivera has earned the California Distinguished School in 2001, 2009 and 2013. With an enrollment of 
approximately 500 sixth, seventh and eighth graders, Fernando Rivera School can be said t

who come from homes where English is a second language.
 
 
Our school has a strong academic program. We have an elec

program, exemplary classes in art, computer literacy, web page design, Yearbook and Publications, and Student 
Government. We offer an after care and enrichment program to assist student learning. We have 
a collaboration the 
Peninsula YMCA to provide after school services to our school.
 
 
Visitors to our campus often comment on its warm and friendly atmosphere, where it is easy to see enthusiastic students 
and staff at work. Our schools mission is to challen
ge and nurture every student, every day. At Fernando Rivera

adults and students alike

can t
hrive. We believe all students can learn and 
that every student has a unique voice. Our goal is to reach all learners and prepare them for the challenges of an ever
-
changing world. Together we create and model for our students a positive spirit of inclusio
n that is beyond the attitude of

students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and

The major focus areas for staff development are implementation of our new 
curriculum (ELA, Math and SS), instruction 
and restorative practices.   This area was decided as a focus for professional development based on a new adoption cycle, 
school achievement data, and analysis of student surveys and discipline data. Professional 
development is provided 
through full day sessions, after school meetings, and optional professional development days.  Some staff have also 
attended conferences in addition to the professional development offered to all staff. Teachers are supported with 
i
mplementation through principal/vice
-
principal meetings and class visits, coaching as needed and site visits from the 
Teaching and Learning Department.
