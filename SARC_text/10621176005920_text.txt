About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
TK is more than 60 years old and has been maintained in a highly efficient 
manner. We provide a clean, safe learning environ
-
ment for our students. Our 
custodians perform basic cleaning operations daily and maintain the grounds and buildings in an exemplary manner. In addition
, deep cleaning is 
conducted two times a year at our s

and restrooms on a regular basis to pro
-
vide feedback on the care of our facility. When asked to grade how well the build
-
ings and grounds ar
e maintained 

evenings has helped to reduce 
the flow of unwar
-
ranted traffic on campus, and through increased community awareness, p
ride and an open
-
campus policy, we have been able to keep 
vandalism and burglary low. Security gates, parking areas, a new phone system and fire extinguishers have all been installed 
for additional safety and 
security.
 
 
Temperance

Kutner grounds span more 
than 20 acres and accommodate 24 permanent classrooms and 11 portables. The site includes a library media 
center, computer/technology lab, athletic fields, conference room and staff work space. Regular cleaning and maintenance take
s place to ensure that 
th
e school is safe and in good repair. The site custodial staff includes the plant supervisor and three support personnel. Dist
rict grounds and maintenance 
personnel help to perform the many tasks to keep the site in exceptional condition. The play yard and 
equipment are regularly checked and serviced, 
helping to keep the grounds safe and looking nice. Supervision is provided for safety and security purposes before, during an
d after school hours.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of 
study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site

Parent involvement is valued, respected and encouraged at TK. We believe involved parents have a positive and significant imp
act on our staff, students 
and school community. Parents may elect to volunteer in classrooms, chaper
one study trips and support co
-
curricular activities. We provide the parent 
involvement policy to parents annually.
 
 
TK also offers multiple opportunities to provide input and feedback and get involved. The School Assessment Review Team (SART
), Parent Teac
her Club 
(PTC), English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) and School Site Council (SSC) are all groups available to families and commu
nity members to be a part 
of at TK. All committee meeting dates and times, agendas, minutes and general information are re
adily available in the weekly school newsletter and on 
our website.

School Safety Plan
 
 
Temperance
-

e final 
document. The Safe School Plan was last updated and discussed with the school faculty in December 2019. Key elem
ents of the plan include monthly 
safety drills and crisis
-
intervention plans. To supplement the Safe School Plan, an Emergency Procedure Guide has been developed. Students, staff and 
parents are all involved in meetings to discuss, evaluate and practice al
l school emergency procedures and programs. In the event of a major school 
emergency, staff members would proceed to follow established plans and successfully evacuate all students from the site. Comm
unications systems, 
emergency care provisions and commun
ity services have been well planned in the event of a serious site emergency.
 
 
In addition to the emergency plan, student behavior and complaint policies are also posted. The suspension and expulsion poli
cy is outlined in the Safe 
School Plan, along with d
iscipline procedures and the discrimination and harassment policy. Students are involved in safe school programs dealing with

Staff development is an integral component for improving student achievement. Extensive time and effort has
 
been put into training on Balanced Math, 
reading and comprehension strategies, structured engagement, and English language development.
 
 
Professional development is based on student, teacher and district needs and programs. Our site focuses trainings and 
staff development around the 
assessed needs of students and teachers. The staff is actively engaged in on
-
site staff training sessions each month and can elect to attend additional 
district trainings that are offered weekly, ranging from classroom technolo
gy use to lesson design. Professional conferences and county, state and 
national trainings are also made available. The focus at TK continues to be around solving mathematical problems. An ad
d
itional focus this year includes 
social/ emotional support for s
taff and students.
 
 
The Induction program connects a beginning teacher with a veteran teacher for mentoring and guidance. Support providers commi
t to providing service 
to a new teacher for two years in order to help the incoming staff member be successful 
for students. We have five staff members receiving Induction 
support.
 
 
In order to monitor and assess the effectiveness of professional development, teachers are observed formally and in
-
formally in the classroom. Reflective 
conversations take place betwee
n teachers, instructional coaches and administration. Teachers can request in
-
class coaching, opportunities to participate 
in peer observations, and use district self
-
assessment tools to advance their own learning. Ultimately, student performance data comm
unicates the 
overall effectiveness of professional development opportunities offered and applied.
 
 
The district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mast
ery learning, multi
-
tiered syste
m 
of supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In t
he 2018
-
19 school year, 
the district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered 
professional development opportunities on staff 
development days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after
-
school workshops were also offered throughout the school 
year.One hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty
-
five parti
cipating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching 
through the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site
-
based training and district sponsored training that included:  
curriculum tr
aining, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi
-
tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.

Types of Services Funded
 

 
On an annual basis, Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) submits the Application for Funding Consolidated Application and Re
porting System for 
Categorical Aid Programs commonly called CARS. The application is submitted in two (2) parts:  Part I, which con
tains program and demographic 
information, is submitted by June 1 each year; and Part II, which contains the budget information and additional program data
, is submitted by January 
31 each year.  The categorical programs included in the application are Tit
le I, Part A 

 
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged 
Improving, Title I, Part C 

 
Migrant Education, Title II, Part A 

 
Preparing, Training and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals, and Title III 

 
Language Instruction for Limi
ted English Proficient and Immigrant Students.  Essentially, these funds are designed to assist students in mastering state 
standards.
 
 
Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community
.  CUSD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive differences in the lives of the children we all support.  We know from research tha

education will not only bring success to your child but other children 
in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending
 
on the type of categorical 
funding a site may re
ceive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and guidelines.  Such adviso
ry 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each a
nd every student.  Parental involvement is a necessary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall program.  At the district level, parent committees provide input into each of the 

Local Education Agency P
lan (LEAP).  If you would like additional information on any of the District Parent Councils or Committees, please call your 

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: 
to 
http://www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed
 
of parents, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.

District Adviso
ry Committee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves as an advisory
 
committee 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school c
ommunity. They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs are supplemental education opportunit
ies that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  The SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are 
required to form an ELAC. The ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding ser
vices for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two 
years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall 
be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a D
ELAC representative and arrange to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/gu
ardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) 
currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) elected to serve as the DELAC 

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meet
s four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achievement of our students, comm
unity agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan
 
Native students in grades K

assists eligible students to achieve at the same challenging state performance standards expected of all students in grades p

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP a
nnually that works to better align the academic plan with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to 
participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participa
tion of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, District Meetings and 
Community Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share 
their ideas on how CUSD 
ca
n provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in the forums wi


 
 
These forums are designed to provide an opportunit

provide input and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to sha
re new ideas to support 
identifi
ed groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical funding and programs in CUSD.  These funds are further discussed and outlined
 

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 
Gen

ics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economic
ally disadvantaged homes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they have a primary language other than English.  Ch
ildren, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally
 
provided through the base/core curriculum program.  The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Catego
rical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support t
o meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of high quality learning opportunities and access to the co
re curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additiona
l assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom program (base/core curriculum) 
and address any learning gaps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff dev
elopment.   Staff development 
activit
ies are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other staff to challen
ge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
