Gregory

reviews
 
and
 
revises
 
the
 
Comprehensive
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
for
 
our
 
school
 
site
 
annually.
 
The
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
includes
 
the
 
process
 
for
 
addressing
 
serious
 
situations
 
such
 
as
 
malicious
 
intruders,
 
fire,
 
earthquake,
 
and
 
other
 
events
 
that
 
may
 
impact
 
our
 
school
 
and
 
community.
 
An
 
element
 
of
 
this
 
plan
 
is
 
parent
 
communication
 
through
 
the
 
automated
 
School
 
Messenger
 
system.
 
Parents
 
are
 
also
 
encouraged
 
to
 
subscribe
 
to
 
the
 
local
 
NIXLE
 
information
 
system
 
through
 
Pleasant
 
Hill
 
Police
 
Department.

In
 
recent
 
years
 
the
 
school
 
has
 
experienced
 
poor
 
air
 
quality
 
due
 
to
 
smoke
 
from
 
regional
 
fires.
 
This
 
has
 
kept
 
students
 
inside
 
for
 
recesses.
 
The
 
processes
 
for
 
what
 
was
 
formerly
 
"Rainy
 
Day
 
Recesses"
 
have
 
been
 
updated
 
and
 
improved
 
to
 
provide
 
more
 
comprehensive
 
coverage
 
for
 
students.
 
A
 
system
 
for
 
pairing
 
volunteers
 
with
 
staff
 
to
 
assist
 
with
 
supervision
 
was
 
implemented
 
this
 
year.
 
Finger
 
printed
 
volunteers
 
are
 
also
 
encouraged
 
to
 
participate
 
in
 
recess
 
activities,
 
to
 
encourage
 
physical
 
activity
 
and
 
good
 
sportsmanship.
