Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The safety of students and staff is of utmost importance to Lincoln Learning Community. Supervision is provided to ensure 
student safety on school 
grounds before, during, and after school. School entrances are secured or monitored during 
school hours and visitors report to the office first.  Emergency and evacuation procedures are posted across the campus 
and practiced regularly.
 
 
The Comprehensive S
chool Safety Plan, developed by the school in partnership with the School Site Council (SSC), provides 
additional information regarding maintaining a safe environment and preparing for emergencies. The plan is revised and 
approved by the school board each 
year. It was last reviewed/updated in January 2019 and discussed with staff in January 
2019.

Professional development at Lincoln Learning Community is focused on providing teachers, coaches, and administrators 
with the necessary training to ensure quality classroom environments, curricula, instruction, and
 
assessment at all grade 
levels. Specific topics are identified through a review of student academic achievement data, observation records, and 
self
-
identification of needs. Professional development also addresses issues specific to the performance
-
based s
ystem 
(PBS). Professional development opportunities include: district
-
wide in
-
services; site specific in
-
services; observations and 
training by site or district coaches; grade
-
level or department meetings; and more. The Beginning Teachers Support and 
Asses
sment (BTSA) and Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) programs also provide assistance to beginning and veteran 
teachers, as necessary. In 2018 
-
 
2019, the district offered early release/late start Staff Development meetings on 
Wednesdays, as well as 5 days of
 
Professional Development.  Learning Facilitators have received professional learning in 
Guided Reading, English Language Development, and Math.
