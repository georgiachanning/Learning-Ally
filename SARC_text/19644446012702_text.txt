By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
La Ballona Elementary School is located in the ethnically an
d socially diverse community of Culver City. One of the oldest 
elementary schools on record in Los Angeles County, its original wood frame building was constructed in 1865, before the 
city was established. It served as the elementary school to the children
 
of the surrounding rancho community. Since that 
time, Culver City has evolved from a rancho community to a motion picture industrial center and a prominent arts and 
business center. Currently, La Ballona Elementary school serves a diverse population of st
udents, nearly half of whom 
come from homes where Spanish is the primary language. Multiple other home languages are represented, bringing a 
richness and understanding of different cultures to the educational experience. Beginning in the 09
-
10 school year,
 
La 
Ballona Elementary School introduced a Spanish dual language immersion program. The program is now fully 
implemented, K
-
5, and runs parallel to our TK
-
5 English curriculum program.
 
 
At La Ballona, we believe in a whole child/whole community approach. W
e understand that hunger and instability are 
barriers to success. With support from our parent and local communities, we have been able to implement Backpacks for 
Kids

a weekend food program for our neediest families, a Wednesday Farmers Market that provid
es fresh produce free 
of charge thanks to the Culver City Farmers Market held on Tuesdays.  A Family Center which serves close to 20% of our 
school population; the PTA School Smarts parent education program to facilitate parent involvement. This year La Ba
llona 
has replaced the Character Counts with the CHAMPS system of positive behavior.This program is designed to  to reduce 
discipline referrals by focusing on recognizing and rewarding the positive behaviors we expect. Our classes in grades k
-
2 
are receivi
ng "Second Step" lessons which gives all students a common language to use when dealing with social situations. 
Teachers and staff reinforce this as well by reinforcing the same language in common areas of the school.
 
 
Students at La Ballona Elementary Sch
ool have continuously attained higher levels of proficiency. While many practices 
have been successfully implemented, staff have continued to work to identify areas for growth, as well as strategies and 
techniques to address remaining needs. Strong in lite
racy and mathematics instruction, staff at La Ballona Elementary 
School understood the need to work toward greater levels of student engagement and differentiation as a means to 
addressing the needs of an ever changing student population. Additionally, sta
ff identified a need to strengthen existing 
models of intervention so that our most at risk students continue to have the same opportunity for success as their grade 
level peers. Through collaborative work in Professional Learning Communities, the staff at
 
La Ballona continues to reflect 
upon their practice through team planning, common formative assessment, data analysis, and targeted intervention and 
enrichment.
 
 
Additionally, we have committed parent groups dedicated to enhancing and supporting the educa
tion of our students. 
Many of our classrooms have parent volunteers who help students and teachers meet and surpass their goals. After
-
school enrichment, homework, and academic intervention programs are located on our campus. The PTA provides 
assemblies an
d field trips that The 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement.
 
address content standards for all classes and raise needed funds to enhance our school. Our ELAC members advise 
administration on issues related to English language acquisition and the new ELPAC t
esting.
 
 
All stakeholders at La Ballona work intently to fulfill our vision through a focus on the whole child. At La Ballona Elementa
ry 
school, there is no doubt that we all, as a community, expect and demand the best for our students, and we work toward 
the common goal of providing the best possible academic, social, and emotional education for them.

Reading/Language Arts and Content Standards
 
La Ballona School uses the district adopted kindergarten through fifth grade reading and writing curriculum that follows 
the California State Content Standards.  Each g
rade level has standards for reading, writing, written and oral English 
language conventions, listening, and speaking.  Students are provided instruction at their grade level with differentiation 
for those that are stuggling or are above grade level.  The 
Culver City Unified School District uses Houghton Mifflin Harcourt 
Journeys as our reading and language arts core instructional program.  Teacher have been trained as well in Guided 
Reading/Daily 5/CAFE for language arts instruction and Writer's Workshop f
or writing instruction.  Reading and writing 
are assessed throughout the year using publisher and district benchmark assessments.  English Language Development 
(ELD) is provided to English language learners and instruction targets their English language le
vels.  Intensive training in 
ELD instruction is part of the site's professional development plan.
 
 
Mathematics and Content Standards
 
Culver City Unified School District uses the adopted kindergarten through fifth grade mathematics curriculum that follows 
the California State Content Standards.  Our math program is Bridges Math.  La Ballona teachers have been trained 
extensively in Cognitively Guided Instruction and this is evident in every classroom.  In addition, La Ballona Elementary 
School uses the ST M
ath+Music program to supplement the district adopted standards
-
based mathematics curricular 
materials.  This program develops student's inate ability to visualize and manipulate images 
-
 
and problems in space and 
time using Spatial Temporal Reasoning.  Spa
tial temporal reasoning refers to every person's ability to solve multi
-
step 
problems by visualizing components and processes in space and time, recognizing the structure of the problem, and then 
planning a sequence of steps that overcome the obstacles to 
arrive at a solution.  Because ST Math+Music is non
-
language 
based, it is immediately helpful to English Language Learners.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of 
Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathem
atics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] 
for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career
 
technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

At La Ballona Elementary School, the school leadership team and grade level 
Professional Learning Communities study 
student achievement, analyze needs, identify areas for intervention and/or enrichment, and identify topics for staff 
development. Over the past several years, a comprehensive staff development program has included si
te and district wide 
assistance to teachers on ELD instruction (Integrated and Designated ELD time), Common Core content standards, 
Professional Learning Communities, use of assessments such as Common Formative Assessments, data analysis, 
interdisciplinary
 
curriculum, high engagement strategies (Instructional Quality), special needs students, differentiation, EL 
students, the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program, Caring School Community program, Technology, paraprofessional 
training and additional topics impa
cting instruction, such as classroom management and use of technology. Professional 
development days have been utilized for discussion and training on instruction and assessment. New teachers have 
attended Los Angeles County workshops and the Beginning Tea
cher Support and Assessment program (BTSA) offerings.
 
 
Teachers at La Ballona Elementary School regularly meet in Professional Learning Communities to collaborate and analyze 
formative assessment data.  Teachers work together to design and implement academ
ic interventions in the classroom to 
support students who struggle with achieving grade
-
level benchmarks. These meetings are also designed to support and 
further the two programs that we house here at La Ballona; our Dual Language Immersion and English Onl
y programs.
 
 
Whole staff and in Professional Learning Communities, teachers regularly participate in the reading and discussion of 
research articles about literacy and pedagogy.  Teacher training in research
-
based strategies for enhancing instruction in 
re
ading and written language as well as in strategies for working with English Language Learners has been provided by the 
District as well.
 
 
At La Ballona Elementary School we take very seriously the mandate of legislation to close the achievement gap. It is
 
our 
goal to work with our students to maximize their potential and instill in them a love of life
-
long learning.
