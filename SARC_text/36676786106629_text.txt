About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
On October 3, 201

 
textbooks 
and instructional materials have been provided to students. The Board of Education adopted Resolution 2019/2020
-
18 which
 
certifies as required by 
Education Code 60119 that (1) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials have been provided to each student, including 
English learners, that are 
aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with the cycles and c
ontext of the curriculum frameworks in the following subjects: 
history/social science, mathematics, reading/language arts, and science, (2) sufficient textbooks or instructional materials 
were provided to each pupil 
enrolled in foreign language and/or heal
th classes, (3) laboratory equipment was available for science laboratory classes offered in grades 9
-
12, inclusive.
 
 
Textbooks and instructional materials are provided for each student for use in class and to take home. It was determined that
 
each pupil i
n each school 
has sufficient textbooks and instructional materials that are aligned to the academic content standards in the core subject a
reas for the 2019/2020 school 
year. Additionally, sufficient textbooks and/or instructional materials were provided t
o each pupil for visual and performing arts.*Please note: In 
reference to materials not from a most recent State Board Adoption (SBE): In November 2017, the California State Board of Edu
cation approved a list of 
History/Social Science programs for district
s to consider for their new adoption. CVUSD elected to continue to use current District adopted materials 
while further studying program options provided on the SBE list to consider for a future piloting process. CVUSD reviewed cur
rent District adopted 
mat
erials and determined that they meet current history/social science standards.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Chino Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) makes it a priority to maintain safe, clean, and effective school sites for our 
students, staff, and parents. The 
safety of students is of paramount importa
nce to CVUSD. In the morning, staff supervision is provided to watch the cafeteria, entrance gates, and 
playground activities. During lunch and recess times, noon ground supervisors and teachers monitor students to ensure student
s interact safely. At the 
e
nd of the school day, staff supervises student dismissal. The staff and student workspaces for this site are cleaned on a reg
ular basis by the school site 
custodial staff. In addition to regular cleanings, deep cleanings are scheduled and carried out durin
g breaks and vacation periods. The school facility is 
adequate and has sufficient classrooms, playgrounds, and staff spaces in order to operate efficiently. A planned or recently 
completed school 
improvement for this site is a full school modernization pro
ject planned beginning in the 2020/2021 school year and a schoolwide security camera and 
keyless access system planned for the 2020/2021 school year

To ensure sites are clean, safe and functional, Maintenance and Operations department staff conduct inspec
tions at the school sites on a continual basis. 
School sites may also enter maintenance requests by accessing the School Dude system. After the school site request is entere
d into the system, a work 
order is generated, and the Maintenance staff works dilig
ently to complete all work orders in a timely manner.  The Maintenance team utilized the Facility 
Inspection Tool (FIT), a survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction (OPSC), 
to record inspection results. 
The
 

ciated repairs were 
completed on or before December 30, 2019.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca

Parents are an integral part of Eagle Canyon, and they are critical to the success of our pro
gram. We have a very active, supportive parent group that 
continually volunteers in classrooms, Art Pals program, library, and training sessions for volunteers and the many activities
 
sponsored by our very active 
PTA. Our annual Fall Family Festival event 
is evidence that our parents are actively engaged and appreciate being a part of the Eagle Canyon community.
 
 
Special events are built into our year to bring our families together, building a sense of community. We begin our year with 
an annual Back to Sch
ool; 
Open House is preceded by a dinner with entertainment by our school chorus and school band; we end the year with a wonderful 

PTA and School Site Council meet every other month during the school year. Our English Language Advisory C
ommittee meets at least four times a year. 
Our Accelerated Reader Program is sponsored by our PTA. All parents and community members are invited to attend any school me
eting or activity. We 
are extremely proud of our parent participation and support.

Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Each school has a detailed Scho
ol Site Safety Plan for emergencies that is annually reviewed, updated, and discussed by the School Site Council. The date 
on which the School Site Safety Plan was last annually reviewed was March 2019, and the plans are reviewed monthly by the Sch
ool Site
 
Council.  Each 

onents and procedures. 
Fire, earthquake, and intruder drills are held on a regular basis so that all students and s
taff are familiar with emergency procedures. Emergency supplies 
are located on each campus in the event of an emergency.
 
 
Assigned staff monitors school grounds daily before, during, and after school.  The District policy regarding campus visitors
 
is enfor
ced by requiring 

-
in log is located in the school office and all visitors must sign in before 
going onto the campus. In addition, all visitors must wear an identifying ba
dge while on campus. To increase security, all gates remain locked during the 
school day, so visitors must enter campus through the school office.
 
 
The Chino Valley Unified School District is committed to providing an environment that fosters health and safety, in both for
m and function. This 
commitment extends to the process of developing and maintaining a comprehensive Emergency and Disaster Prepare

Safe Schools Plan and is evident from the individual site to the overall District. These plans delineate actions to protect a
ll students while they are at 
school. The plans are designed with the help of security staff
 
members, local law enforcement, local fire, and emergency management, and public health 
officials as required by Education Code 32280
-
32282.
 
 
Plans are reviewed and updated yearly in accordance with Education Code 32286. These plans include procedures to 
respond to critical incidents, such 
as fire, earthquake, or intruders. School personnel practice these drills regularly.
 
 
The primary purpose of the Chino Valley Unified School District Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan is to define roles a
nd respon
sibilities at the 
site and between the site and district office management. The Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan establishes the minimu
m requirements for 
school and site plans throughout the District. This Plan meets the requirements of the Standar
dized Emergency Management System (SEMS) as mandated 
by California Code of Regulations, Sections 2400
-
2450, and the National Incident Management System (NIMS) as mandated by Government Code 8607. 
It also meets the requirements for earthquake preparedness f
ound in Title 5 (California State Education Code, Sections 35295
