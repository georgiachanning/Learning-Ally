About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publis
h a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a
 
Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent w
ith data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abou
t the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school 
principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Ac

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides
 
the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
San Onofre School is committed to working with our parents to extend and enrich the school experience for all students. We be
lieve in providing parents 
and families with regular communication through our school website, 

our monthly school newsletter. Opportunities for parents to engage in the school are outlined annually in our Parent and Fami
ly Engagement Plan. We 
welcome parents on our c
ampus and annually offer a "Meet and Greet" before school begins, a Fall "Back To School Night," student
-
led parent 
conferences, Coffee and Conversation with the Principal, a "Leadership Day," Family STEM events, and a Spring "Open House." W
e offer a varie
ty of 
parent volunteer, education, and engagement opportunities at our site. We encourage parents and community members to join the
 
Parent Teacher 
Association (PTA), and to participate by attending various school committee meetings such as School Site Coun
cil (SSC), English Learner Advisory 
Committee (ELAC) and Lighthouse Leadership Meetings. For more information regarding parent involvement opportunities please s
ee the school site 
Parent and Family Engagement Plan, contact the site administration or your c
hild's teacher.
 
 
State Priority: School Cli
mate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Each Fallbrook 
Union Elementary School District site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP), including a disaster preparedness 
plan 
annually. School administrators work closely with local law enforcement, fire department and/or the Provost Marshall's Office
 
on Camp Pendleton who 
review the plans and also participate in emergency drills, provide feedback, attend site and district safety meetings and col
laboratively help to improve 
overall campus safety, climate, and security.  Copies of the Comprehensive Schoo
l Safety Plans are available for review at each school office. The plan 
includes emergency procedures for school safety, natural disasters, and campus intruders. It also contains appropriate strate
gies and programs that will 
provide or maintain a high leve

teachers, and staff are trained to prepare for a wide range of emergency situations, and frequent drills help to refine emerg
ency sk
ills, policies, and 
procedures at all school sites. Following each drill, specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to co
ntinually improve emergency 
procedures, and improve campus safety.
 
 
Finally, school and district administrators
 
immediately investigate threats of harm. Teachers and administrators seek to foster lines of open 
communication so students and parents feel comfortable reporting inappropriate activity including bullying, harassment, or th
reats. All FUESD staff take 
a st
rong stand against threatening behavior or bullying and investigate complaint matters fully. Many positive programs exist dis
trictwide to enhance 
and continually improve school culture and climate, including Positive Behavior Intervention and Support, Rest
orative Practices, Suicide Prevention, Anti
