Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Courreges Elementary School was originally constructed in 1974 and is currently comprised of 26 classrooms, a computer 
lab, a library, and a spacious playground. The campus underwent a modernization project 
between summer 2003 and fall 
2005, at which time all facilities were renovated. In 2018
-
19, the campus is undergoing another modernization project, 
which provides further upgrades, including new carpet, windows, airflow, and air
-
conditioning.  The facility
 
supports 
teaching and learning through its ample classroom and recreational space.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 

Education has adopted cleaning st
andards for all schools in the District. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily 
basis throughout the school year with an emphasis on classrooms and restrooms. A joint effort between students and 
staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-
free

sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.

Maintenance & Repair:
 
A routine maintenance program is administered by Courreges Elementary Schoo

more complex maintenance functions occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program 
is administered by Fountain Valley School District's Maintenance & Operations Department to ens
ure that school grounds 
and facilities remain in excellent repair. A work order process is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. 
Emergency repairs are given the highest priority; repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order
 
in which they 
are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
Deferred maintenance includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. Fountain Valley School District did not participate
 
in the State School Deferred Maintenance 
Budget Program. Fountain Valley School District sets aside funds each year to specifically address deferred maintenance 
needs. The passing of Measure O provided additional, much
-
needed funds for these types of proj
ects.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The safety of students and 
staff is a primary concern of Courreges Elementary School. Students are supervised before/after 
school, during lunch and recess periods by teachers, administrators, trained aides, and classified staff. All visitors to the
 
campus must sign in through the Ra

times during their stay on school grounds.
 
 
The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and State earthquake 
standard
s. The Safety Committee reviews and updates the Safe School Action Plan each year by March 1st. Any and all 
revisions to the plan are immediately communicated to classified and certificated staff.
 
 
The Goals and Objectives in the Safe School Action Plan fo
cus on three areas:
 
1)
 
School climate characterized by caring and connected
-
ness,
 
2)
 
Safe and orderly physical environment of the school, and
 
3)
 
The health and wellness of students.
 
 
To supplement the Safe School Action Plan, every school also has a disaster preparedness plan that includes steps for 
ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire, disaster, and lock
-
down drills are conducted on a rotating basis 
throughout the
 
school year.  Courreges staff participated in extensive professional development related to safety during 
the 2019
-
20 school year.

Staff development is a priority in the Fountain Valley School District.  We value the impact highly skilled instructors have 
on student achievement. Three days are reserved specifically for this purpose for al
l employees in FVSD, and an additional 
three days are reserved specifically for professional development related to supporting ELA, Math, and Science.  During 
the school year, there are numerous other opportunities for teachers to attend training either be
fore, during, or after the 
school day.  Throughout the District, there are both school level and district
-
wide initiatives.  Recent training initiatives in 
Fountain Valley School District and Courreges Elementary School include:
 
 

 
Cognitively Guided Instruc
tion (CGI) in Mathematics
 

 
Balanced Literacy (i.e. Reading Workshop, Shared Reading, etc.)
 

 
Fountas and Pinnell Assessment Kit and Leveled Literacy Intervention (F&P)
