School Description
 
Maie Ellis Elementary is a TK
-
6th grade Dual Language School of Choice Program located in the 
Fallbrook Union Elementary School District.  Dual Immersion education is an innovative, research
-
based approach in which children develop the ability to speak, re
ad, and write in English and a 
second language.  Dual language programs use two languages for literacy and content instruction 
for all students.  Each day all students will receive 50% of instruction in English and 50% in Spanish.  
All teachers are highly 
qualified and all self
-
contained classrooms have BCLAD credentialed 
teachers.  Maie Ellis Elementary has advisory committees to help support our vision and mission 
statements through School Site Council, English Learner Advisory Committee and Parent Teache
r 
Student Association.
 
 
OUR GOALS:
 
Bilingualism and Biliteracy: Students develop proficient levels of listening, oral, reading, and writing 
proficiency in both Spanish and English for the purpose of communicating effectively both inside 
the 
classroom and in the wider global community.
 
 
Academic Excellence: Students achieve academic excellence in all subject areas as they learn 
educational content in both languages.
 
 
Multicultural competence: Students develop positive cross
-
cultural understand
ing and 
demonstrate the ability to appreciate the traditions and values of various cultures in our society 
and around the world.
 
 
MISSION:
 
To provide a bilingual academic approach, giving our students greater opportunities while 
educating them in a positiv
e socio
-
cultural learning environment and instilling leadership skills to 
be successful in a globally competitive world.
 
 
VISION:
 
All students will be high achieving bilingual, biliterate leaders, with positive socio
-
cultural values.

About the SARC
 
By Febr
uary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fund
ing Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state 
and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority
: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priori
ty 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Maie Ellis Elementary is committed to working with our parents to
 
extend and enrich the school experience for all students. We believe in providing 
parents and families with regular communication through our school website, Peachjar flyers, "all calls," social media feeds,
 
and our weekly 
communication folders. Opportuni
ties for parents to engage in the school are outlined annually in our Parent and Family Engagement Plan. We welcome 
parents on our campus and annually offer a "Meet and Greet" before school begins, a Fall "Back To School Night," student
-
led parent conferen
ces, Coffee 
and Conversation with the Principal, a "Leadership Day," Family STEM events, and a Spring "Open House." We offer a variety of
 
parent volunteer, 
education, and engagement opportunities at our site. We encourage parents and community members to j
oin the Parent Teacher Student Association 
(PTSA), and to participate by attending various school committee meetings such as School Site Council (SSC), English Learner 
Advisory Committee (ELAC) 
and Lighthouse Leadership Meetings. For more information regar
ding parent involvement opportunities please see the school site Parent and Family 
Engagement Plan, contact the site administration or your child's teacher.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priorit
y 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Each Fallbrook Union Elementary School District site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP), including a disaste
r preparedness plan 
annually. School administrators work closely with local law enforcement, fire department and/or the Provost Mar
shall's Office on Camp Pendleton who 
review the plans and also participate in emergency drills, provide feedback, attend site and district safety meetings and col
laboratively help to improve 
overall campus safety, climate, and security.  Copies of the Comp
rehensive School Safety Plans are available for review at each school office. The plan 
includes emergency procedures for school safety, natural disasters, and campus intruders. It also contains appropriate strate
gies and programs that will 
provide or maint

ty. Students, 
teachers, and staff are trained to prepare for a wide range of emergency situations, and frequent drills help to refi
ne emergency skills, policies, and 
procedures at all school sites. Following each drill, specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to co
ntinually improve emergency 
procedures, and improve campus safety.

Finally, school and district administrators immediately investigate threats of harm. Teachers and administrators seek to fost
er lines of open 
communication so students and parents feel comfortable reporting inappropriate activity including bullying, harass
ment, or threats. All FUESD staff take 
a strong stand against threatening behavior or bullying and investigate complaint matters fully. Many positive programs exist
 
districtwide to enhance 
and continually improve school culture and climate, including Posit
ive Behavior Intervention and Support, Restorative Practices, Suicide Prevention, Anti
