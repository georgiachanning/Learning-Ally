About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to 
publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to pre
pare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consis
tent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more informatio
n about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school prin
cipal or the district office.
