By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
As the proud principal of Berlyn Elementary school, I would like to welcome you to our school.
 
 
Berlyn Elementary serves students from Transitional Kindergarten through 6th grade. We currently have approximately 
74
5 students who are served by 32 dedicated certificated teachers and an additional support staff of approximately 45. 

 

 
 
The mi
ssion of Berlyn Elementary is to inspire innovative life
-
long learners who can pursue college and career. We provide 
challenging instruction to all students through the development of skills in technology, positive behavior, and higher level 
thinking.
 
 
Ber
lyn Elementary School offers an academically rich program for TK
-
6th graders utilizing technology as an avenue for 
learning. We focus on technology skills, positive behavior and higher level thinking strategies to ensure students are 
engaged in learning to
 
move forward towards college and career as 21st century learners.  We utilize devices at a minimum 
ration of 3 students to every device in primary classrooms, and in 3rd
-
6th grades every student utilizes a device to support 
their learning.  Our Berlyn Bad
ge program challenges students to learn new technology concepts as well as frequent visits 
to our Innovation Studio, our version of a makerspace.
 
 
Our school implements Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports, commonly known as PBIS.  One 
component is the 
use of our five behavior expectations.  The Students at Berlyn Elementary School will: Be Safe, Be Kind, Be Respectful, Be 
Responsible, Be Persistent.  We were proud recipients of the Gold PBIS award recognition in 2019.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Berlyn School opened in 1955 on 9.2 acres of land. Eighteen of the classrooms are in portable buildings installed at various 
times between 1986 
and 2009 to house the student population. In 2008, a Multipurpose Building, that houses a kitchen, 
storage areas, and two restrooms were completed.Students are allowed on campus at 7:20 a.m. for breakfast and are 
allowed on the playground at 7:40 a.m. Teac
hers, administrators, and support staff supervise all student recesses, arrivals, 
and dismissals. The entire front of the school is fenced in. All gates are locked during school hours. All visitors are requi
red 
to check in and sign in at the school office 
and wear visitor badges while on campus. During drop
-
off and dismissal, 
teachers and administrators monitor three gates that are open for student pick
-
up by parents. Anyone checking out 
students early from school is verified by office staff as authorized a

officially sign the student out of school. The school has a total of 34 classrooms, a library, a Makerspace, an administratio
n 
building with a staff workroom, a separate office building, and a multi
-
purpose ro
om. The school facility offers a safe 
learning environment with fully functioning lighting, heating, and cooling  systems, and noise negation. Wireless and 
network internet access is available in the office and all classrooms. Each portable classroom is ap
proximately 850 square 
feet. Our permanent classroom structures are approximately 1000 square feet. There are 20 restrooms available for 
students and staff, all of which are in working condition. The school has two lunch shelters where students eat breakfa
st 
and lunch, as well as a large field with sufficient playground equipment for student engagement.
 
 
Ontario
-
Montclair School District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in
 
a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that 
emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
The Ontario
-
Montclair School District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To a
ssist 
in this effort, the Ontario
-
Montclair School District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California 
OPSC. The results of this survey are available at the school office or Ontario
-
Montclair School District office.  The LEA 
gov
erning board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the Ontario
-
Montclair School District. A summary of 
these standards is available at the school office or at the Ontario
-
Montclair School District office. The principal works daily 
with the cust
odial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 

assist schools with the expenditures for major repairs and u
pgrades. Typically, this includes the following: roofing, 
plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, floor, and carpeting. Each year the 
district matches the required allotment set by the state in order to parti
cipate in the deferred maintenance program.
 
 
During the most recent Facility Conditions Evaluation conducted on September 3, 2019, by the County's Williams Team, 
facilities and buildings, rooms, and grounds were found to be in "good repair."  The Facility 
Inspection Tool was used 
throughout a walk through of our school. There were no insufficiencies or deficiencies observed at the time of the 
inspection.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the
 
total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Student learning is enhanced by an orderly, drug
-
free and safe school climate. The safety of all students is handled through 
a school
-
wide Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS) program. Berlyn has an active Associated Student Body 
(ASB) that f
ocuses on government, philanthropy, and student advisory decision making.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan was developed for Berlyn Elementary School in collaboration with local 
agencies and the district office. Components of the plan include: ma
intenance, security and safety of the physical 
environment, school climate which addresses disaster procedures and routines, an action plan that ensures a safe physical 
environment and safe school climate, as well as our school safety compliance that ensur
es required child abuse reporting 
procedures, suspension and expulsion policies, due process, notification to teachers about dangerous pupils, sexual 
harassment policy, school
-
wide dress code, procedure for safe ingress and egress from school, procedures t
o ensure a 
safe and orderly environment and rules and procedures on school discipline. Monthly disaster drills are scheduled and 
practiced school
-
wide to ensure student safety procedures. The plan was recently reviewed and discussed with the staff 
in Octob
er 2019. School Site Council last approved the Berlyn Elementary School Safety Plan on February 22, 2019. An 
approved copy of the school site safety plan may be obtained at Berlyn Elementary School's main office or the Ontario

procedures during emergencies. Updated Emergency Response Booklets and Earthquake Procedures Booklets are 
available to all Berlyn staff m
embers. Plans include: 
 

 
Detailed procedures for fire and lockdown situations
 

 
First aid and lifesaving procedures
 

 
Duties and responsibilities of the different emergency response teams
 

 
A detailed inventory and location of disaster supplies
 
Students are 
instructed about and continually practice procedures for such occurrences as fire, earthquakes, intruder, and 
lock downs on a monthly basis. The district has provided Berlyn with training in light search and rescue, disaster 
preparedness and efficient emer
gency procedures. Emergency equipment and supplies are checked periodically. Parents 
are informed of the emergency procedures on an annual basis through our Parent/Student Handbook, SELPAC, SSC, and 
other parent meetings.
 
 
Staff members at Berlyn are commi
tted to providing all students with a safe, orderly, and drug
-
free environment. Safety 
plan and disaster drill training was conducted on 10/19/2019 to include staff and students. Annually, parents are invited 
to meet with site administration to review our 
safety plan as well as participate in our drills. We are implementing parent 
communication following each drill through Connect Ed phone messages and utilizing an Emergency Text messaging 
feature. This will allow the administration to communicate with fami
lies important information once it is safe to do so 
during the event of an emergency. Berlyn School encourages students, staff and families to follow the Ontario
-
Montclair 
School District's "See Something, Hear Something, Say Something" safety campaign. Th
is campaign is shared with parents 
in newsletters as well as students multiple times each school year.

Berlyn Elementary certificated and classified staff members have the opportunity for continued professional growth.
 
 
Annually staff provides input on the Staff Development that they would like to engage in. We also 
utilized assessment 
data to determine areas of need for continued professional development and planning. Berlyn has developed an 
instructional leadership team that consists of administration, support staff and teachers who meet regularly to plan our 
profes
sional development offerings.
 
 
Professional Development occurs in a variety of forms, whole staff meetings and training, virtual sessions, OMSD district 
workshops, data and planning release days, and individual coaching cycles with an administrator or Teac
her On 
Assignment. Through our professional development plan, teachers are monitored and supported with co
-
teaching, 
teacher/administration meetings, formal and informal visits to classrooms and student performance/data decision
-
making.
 
 
Certificated Staff

of the Common Core State Standards, implementation of Learning Targets, research based best practices, planning for 
individualized support and interve
ntion, and various grade levels are attending additional training in the areas of 
Mathematics, Literacy and Fluency. During Previous school years (2017
-
