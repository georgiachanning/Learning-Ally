By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Coronado Elementary School believes that public education provides opportunities and experiences t
hat are essential to 
the future and success of our community.
 
 
We believe we must:
 

 
Treat everyone with courtesy, dignity, and respect;
 

 
Provide a safe and nurturing environment;
 

 
Develop lifelong learners and contributing members of society;
 

 
Take 
responsibility for our behavior and performance;
 

 
Provide equitable and essential communications and support; and
 

 
Celebrate the diversity, uniqueness, and contributions of all our community members.
 
At Coronado Elementary School, we are very proud of our ac
ademic accomplishments. We have received a California Title 
I Academic Achievement Award for the school year 2007
-
2008. We also received the designation of being a California Gold 
Ribbon school for our school
-
wide implementation of the social emotional Too
lBox program for the school year of 2015
-
2016. The past two years Coronado has had a school
-

acquire an intrinsic value for reading. The focus on reading assisted us in seeing an improvement i
n our early testers on 
the SBAC. Another part of our school success is the fact that we have had monthly Parent Nights for more than ten years, 
where we provide information to our parents about their child's education and celebrate their child's success wi
th Perfect 
Attendance, Good Citizenship, and Honor Roll Awards.
 
 
We currently have approximately 410 students in grades TK
-
6. We also currently have both a SPED preschool and a state 
preschool class. We are proud that our school is
 
95% students of color, with approximately 25% African American students, 
70% English language learners and 5% white. This is the 7th year of our Transitional Kinder program, where younger 
students attend a full
-
day in preparation for success in kindergart
en and/or first grade. We also have full
-
day kindergarten 
for 3 classes. In addition, we have an after
-
school program that serves 140 students. In addition to a strong academic 
school, Coronado is proud that we have a music program partnered with the Oakla
nd Youth Chorus. Every child in our 
school receives music instruction once a week. The program teaches music appreciation, band, chorus, and the class is 
integrated with the content of classroom instruction. Our music teacher works closely with the classro
om teachers. In 
addition, we believe that this program enhances our academic program and provides a creative outlet for our students. 
Our students also participate in a yearly performance with the San Francisco Opera and enjoy many musical performances 
thr
oughout the year. We have Instrumental Music for students in grades 4th
-
6th.

In addition to our strong music program, we have Toolbox. Another highlight of the Toolbox Learning Program is our 
Toolbox Coaches; students in upper grades who help monitor game
s during recess and coach students in how to play 
safely and cooperatively. To provide our students with tools/strategies for their socio
-
emotional well
-
being, the Toolbox 
program teaches students twelve tools (i.e., Breathing Tool, Patience Tool, Empathy 
Tool, etc.). Toolbox supports our 

-
rounded and can achieve both academically and socially. We 
also participate in the Kennedy Family Sports League participating in various sports. Finally, we have s
everal different 
programs that provide intervention and tutoring assistance to our students. Read
-
Aloud volunteers read to students in 
grades kinder through grade 2 twice a week and are also mentors for the students. This program has been successful at 
Cor
onado for the past ten years. We have a variety of graduate tutors and volunteers who teach students one
-
on
-
one and 
in small groups, to reinforce what is taught in the classroom. Our Learning Center provides support to more than fifty 
students in small gro
ups throughout the week and provides instruction in both language arts and mathematics. Also, we 
have a highly successful After School Program which currently enrolls 200 students.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school us
es 
the Facility Inspec
tion Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service a
nd that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The school personnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

ucation population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs
 
items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses tha
t satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of the 
School Site Safety Plan is to provide a unified template for school sites to respond and recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the disruption of normal school operations.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan guides a coordinated school staff 
response to an emergency, disaster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over time and those that ma
y occur without warning.
 
 
The objectives of the School Site Safety Plan are as follows:
 
1.
 
Protect the safety and welfare of students, school staff, and visitors.
 
2.
 
Provide for a safe and coordinated response to emergencies.
 
3.
 

d properties.
 
4.
 
Enable the District to restore normal conditions with minimal confusion in the shortest time possible.
 
5.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between sites and the District Emergency Operations Center (DEOC).
 
6.
 
Provide for the interface and
 
coordination between the District EOC and the Cities of Richmond, El Cerrito, San 
Pablo, Pinole, Hercules, and Contra Costa County Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
 
7.
 
Provide for the orderly conversion of pre
-
designated District sites to mass care sites, w
hen necessary.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is updated annually.  Our school safety plan was last annually reviewed, updated, 
and discussed with school faculty and a student representative in January 2020.  A copy of the Comprehensive School

Every other Wednesday, the staff is trained on a variety of issues. Teachers meet with their grade level colleagues to share 
successful teaching strategies, review student data, plan instruction, and plan intervention. We also have Monthly Staff 
Meetings w
here teachers and other staff receive important training and staff development. In addition, we have a strong, 
collaborative Instructional Leadership Team that facilitates instructional leadership, plans staff development for teachers, 
and brainstorms solu
tions to issues at school (i.e., ways for teachers to better collaborate, train staff by having veteran 
teachers provide workshops, find smoother processes for recess and lunchroom supervision, etc.) All staff members are 
encouraged to attend as many distr
ict training and workshops as is possible, and we have most of our teachers attending 
workshops during the summer to prepare for the upcoming school year. Our two areas of focus for this year are:
 
1) Language Arts: Increasing student discourse/collaborativ
e conversations, and increasing vocabulary; and
 
2) Multiple Methods for Math.
 
We have several teachers who are informally and formally mentoring our new teaching staff.
 
 
Quality instruction and instructional leadership are at the heart of the district's ac
hievement efforts. To ensure this, the 
Academic Support Division engages teachers, administrators, and other personnel in ongoing professional development 
focused on improving teaching and learning. Training is provided to principals and other administrato
rs to improve their 
ability to provide strong instructional leadership and guide teaching and learning at school sites. The principal, in turn, 
provides support to teachers through staff conferences, opportunities for collaborative study and planning, and 
individual 
coaching based on ongoing classroom observations. Teachers and other staff are provided with both on and off
-
site 
professional development in all standards
-
based curriculum content areas. Beyond the content areas, professional 
development is pro
vided in English Language Development, Gifted and Talented Education (GATE), differentiated 
instruction, educational technology, the incorporation of music into the core content areas, and Toolbox/Mindful Life 
training. In addition, training is made availa
ble in classroom management/restorative practices and the effective use of 
assessment data and teacher data teams in meeting the needs of all students. A primary goal of the professional 
development program is ensuring that all students are served by skill
ed, highly qualified teachers and that teachers are 
supported by strong, knowledgeable instructional leaders.
