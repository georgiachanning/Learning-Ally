By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The strength of our school lies with the knowledgeable, thoughtful, and caring staff who share the belief all
 
students can 
learn. Our teaching faculty of highly qualified, fully credentialed, and Cross
-
Cultural Language and Academic Development 
(CLAD) certified teachers is dedicated to teaching students a core academic curriculum based on state standards. Staff 
c
ollaborates regularly to produce a focused approach to instruction. Cornell Elementary School is made up of a diverse 
student body. Currently, there are approximately 575 students enrolled with more than 28 different languages spoken. 
The school serves stu
dents in grades K
-
5 with 24 general education classrooms and three special
-
education classrooms. 
Additional resources are allocated to serve students in need of reading and math intervention, English Language 
Development (ELD) instruction, speech and langu
age support, special education resource services, adapted physical 
education, occupational therapy, and counseling. Students also participate in music, physical education, science, and 
library classes taught by specialists. These specialists provide instru
ction that enhances the classroom curriculum.
 
 

resources and services are effectively coordinated to meet the needs of all students. Th
rough the Student Success Team 
(SST) and Individualized Education Plan (IEP) process, we identify students who have special needs and then determine 
specific strategies that will best support their academic, social and emotional growth. The staff strives t
o provide students 
with a curriculum that is rigorous, meaningful, relevant, appropriately challenging and allows students to develop their 
critical
-
thinking skills. Instruction is focused on state standards, and all students are making progress toward mas
tery of 
these standards. Cornell teachers differentiate their instruction to meet the individual learning needs of their students. 
Recognizing the need to focus on the whole child, our teaching faculty provides learning experiences which foster social 
and 

 
 
We offer one fee

based enrichment program to students during the Early Bird and Late Bird reading periods in grades 1

Center, at (510) 559

At Cornell Elementary School, our mission is to create a community of self
-
sufficient lifelong learners who are cooperative, 
respectful, and responsible. We create safe, inclusive, 
and engaging classrooms as places of exploration and creativity. We 
have routines and procedures that foster students taking responsibility for learning and achieving their personal best. 
Students reflect on themselves as learners in the roles of readers, 
writers, mathematicians, scientists, historians, 
sociologists, athletes and artists. Our students see their own individual strengths and set goals for their learning. They 
develop the skills to empathize with others through active listening and group work.
 
This helps them see themselves as 
unique and part of a larger diverse society. As we tend to their learning, we emphasize critical thinking, problem solving 
and the ability to express themselves clearly. All of our students are moving toward mastering the
 
essential skills and 
grade
-
level standards so that they can thrive as learners in school and throughout their lives.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
A Facilities Master Plan was 
approved in 2014. Plans are in progress to utilize Bond Measures B & E approved by Albany 
voters in June 2016. In general, our district needs to prepare for anticipated growth in enrollment and the addition and/or 
replacement of existing facilities. The sa
fety of students and staff is a primary concern at Cornell Elementary School. The 
school site safety plan is updated
 
annually.

The key elements of the school site safety plan encompass student safety and evacuation procedures. Fire, earthquake 
and 
lockdown drills are conducted on a regular basis. To ensure student safety, staff members supervise students at all 

office. The scho
ol was built in 1948, and the last building was added in 1974. There are a total of 24 K

5 general
-
education 
classrooms, with 10 of them being portables. The school is in good overall condition. There are sufficient classroom, 
playground and staff spaces t
o support teaching and learning. The school has a multipurpose room, a library, two play 
areas and sufficient classrooms to meet current needs. The principal works with custodial staff members to ensure the 
cleaning of the school is maintained to provide a
 
clean and safe school. District maintenance staff members ensure the 
repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair, and work orders are completed in a timely manner. A work order 
process is used to ensure efficient service and the highest priority t
o emergency repairs.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety is a priority at Cornell School. We have implemented a school 
wide positive
-
behavior program called BEST. Using 
the BEST program as our guide, Cornell staff has developed behavior expectations for common areas around the school. 
Classroom and common
-
area behavior expectations are framed around three core ideas, which
 
serve as our Big Three 
Rules: Be Safe, Be Responsible and Be Respectful. We have also developed and annually update the Peaceful Playground 
Handbook which specifies the guidelines for safe and cooperative play on the play structure and playground. In addi
tion, 
our school has a Conflict Manager program, where 3rd
-
5th grade students assist their peers in resolving conflicts at recess. 
In the classroom, Cornell teachers integrate the Welcoming Schools anti
-
bias curriculum into their instructional programs 
to 
address issues of bullying, diversity and accepting differences.

The Cornell teaching faculty is offered three districtwide staff development days each school year. Along with meetings 
held every Wednesday afternoon, these professional
-
development days offer teachers the opportunity to 
collaborate 
with one another about their curriculum, instruction and assessments, to share best practices with colleagues, and to 

collaborate 
with the faculty at Marin School and Ocean View School in order to align our work across the district. An 


nother means of supporting ongoing professional development, we also meet in professional 
learning communities so that teachers are able to share their expertise with each other and step into the role of learners.
