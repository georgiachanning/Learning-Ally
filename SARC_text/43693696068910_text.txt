By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Joseph George Middle School, a Visual and Performing Arts Academy, is located in East San Jose wit
hin the community of 
Alum Rock. George is designated a Visual and Performing Arts Anchor School (VAPA). The integration of visual and 
performing arts instructional strategies are used in the Social Studies, English Language Arts, Science, and Math. Each cl
ass 
will have opportunities for students to present their artistic skills and integrate 21st century learning.  On top of art 
integration, we are proud to offer the following elective classes: Band, Drum Corps, Choir, Beginning and Advance Art, 
Digital Art
, guitar. MESA, and Leadership. Joseph George provides the staff, students, and parents a showcase of student 
talent a minimum of twice a year at scheduled VAPA Showcase Events.
 
 
Joseph George Middle School is a California 2015 Gold Ribbon School for our S
AFE (Strategic Academic Focused Education) 
Program. Our SAFE Program is built around student engagement in a rigorous academic program with blended learning 
as a tool to support and differentiate our student learning. It provides extra support for our Engl
ish Language Learners. It 
incorporates a continuous improvement in our school culture with positive behavior supports and the emphasis on the 
arts.We utilize state approved curriculum in all subject areas and provide technology resources in the form of Pro
methean 
Technology interactive classrooms, computers, and teacher resources to enhance instruction. Each student receives core 
subject supplementary materials along with guides to effectively utilize them according to the standards being taught.
 
 
Our teach
ers utilize data to inform instruction by creating formative assessments through our academic data management 
systems. Through this process, we take steps to collaborate by department and create methods to increase student 
achievement. Departments have bro
ken down the Common Core State Standards into Essential Learnings. This endeavor 
is in the beginning phase, but we anticipate further enhancement in the future. In addition, trainings have been offered 
and completed by teachers in Direct Instruction.
 
 
A sc
hool wide positive behavior intervention system was created and adopted. The Viking Acts were created by a team of 
staff members in order to build a positive community environment. To promote social and civic responsibility, students 
participate in Charact
er Counts monthly activities. The use of restorative Justice practices provides students the 
opportunity to problem solve and support social
-
emotional learning. We offer a variety of extracurricular programs such 
as organized sports, arts and music. Studen
ts also participate in local VAPA Showcases and music concerts.
 
 
Our 6th grade students participate in Extended Learning Time through Citizen Schools. This provides students with 
homework assistance, master skills building, and apprenticeships with local b
usiness volunteers with a college and career 
focus. This program builds a sense of community and also brings in families for a variety of activities. To completely suppor
t 
our students we offer after school interventions. MESA (Mathematics, Engineering and
 
Science Achievement) is a 
community
-
based after school math and science program that is offered in conjunction with our science club. These 
students go to local, regional and state level competitions.
 
 
Parents are important and valuable partners in the fo
rmal process of educating children. The majority of our parents are 
working parents.  We have a core group of parents that are regular volunteers and participants in our various parent 
engagement activities. We all work together towards increasing our stud
ents achievement. Our Back

School night, book 
fairs, English Learner Advisory Committee, Parent Coffee, School Site Council, Turkey Trot, sports events, awards 
assemblies, Open House, VAPA Showcases and promotion ceremonies are all well attended. We wel
come parents to visit 
classrooms and participate in the planning and implementation of our activities and programs.

Mission:
 
Students will produce portfolios through their time at Joseph George 
Middle School Visual and Performing Arts Academy, 
which will display their work in one of three strand
-
 
visual arts, performing arts, or a combination of the two.  The portfolio 
will showcase their growth, creativity, and academic development through their
 
timed at George.
 
Students will engage in academic opportunities that expand the creative mind, foster and build self confidence, develop 
critical thinking and prepare students for an ever changing world.
 
Teachers will integrate culturally and linguistical
ly responsive visual and performing arts into their curriculum.
 
The school will provide equitable opportunities and full access to a wide array of visual and performing arts electives which
 
will allow students to develop skills and passions within the arts
.
 
Parents will support students through the arts by engaging in parent workshops, running parent organizations that help 
fund the efforts, and attend arts events their student is partaking in.
 
Partnerships with agencies will help to build the divide and br
ing greater access to the school both inside the classroom 
and outside of the normal day.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Joseph George Middle School has a very detailed, comprehensive school safety plan that outlines protocols,
 
systems, and 
procedures in the event of any/all emergencies. School grounds are carefully monitored by school staff at all times. Joseph 
George Middle School has a School Resource Officer (SJPD) five days a week for four hours a day, strategically coordin
ated 
around brunch, lunch and student dismissal times. Teachers supervise selected areas of the school before school, at 
brunch and lunch, and at student dismissal. All outer gates are closed during the school day. The plan also contains the 
yearly safety 
goals as determined by the students, staff, and parents. The Safety Plan is developed by the George Safety 
Committee before it is presented to the Alum Rock Union Elementary School District Board of Trustees for annual 
approval.
 
 
The Safety Plan and drill 
procedures are reviewed during the year with all staff. Safety alerts are shared with all staff as 
needed throughout the school year. In addition, all required drills are calendared and completed, and the results are 
shared with staff. The George Safety Pl
an has a comprehensive, enforceable, and continuous behavior policy, set of rules 
and regulations, dress code policy, set of protocols for safety/emergency drills, tardy policy, attendance policy, referral 
policy, non
-
discriminatory policy on student right
s and responsibilities, campus security policy, harassment policy, and 
Internet safety policy.
 
 
All visitors are required to check
-
in at the school office. Fire drills and disaster procedures are specifically outlined and 
regularly updated and practiced. S
afety programs include drug awareness, personal safety, and personal growth. To 
ensure a safe environment, the district provides SJPD School Resource Officers. The school grounds and playground are 
safe because they are well
-
supervised by staff before, dur
ing, and after school.
 
 
The physical safety of the facilities is supervised through a district manager who supports two custodians. Our safety plan 
is part of our School Site Plan and is revised twice a year using a cycle of inquiry process. School Site Co
uncil members 
approve the plan and participate in its management. School rules are published in the free student handbook, posted on 
the school website, and available at any time in the front office.
 
 
The staff reviews how to recognize and intervene in 
harassment and bullying at staff meetings each semester. We stay up 
to date with current research by attending a variety of conferences and professional development focused on bullying. 
We participated school wide in Anti
-
bullying week where students made 
a pledge against bullying and teachers provided 
a variety of lessons in their classrooms on the topic. The use of restorative justice techniques to problem solve and work 
with students is new this school year. Our Newsletter address bullying and students a
re reminded consistently at a school 
wide expectations assembly. Our on site counselor worked individually with students and helps set up counseling groups 
to address issues.As part of our safety plan we have a positive behavior incentive program with our 
Viking Bucks to 
encourages student to be on task and follow the Viking Acts. Students are recognized for good behavior, dedication to 
their work and effort among other things.
