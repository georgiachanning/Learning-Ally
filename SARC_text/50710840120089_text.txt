About the SAR
C
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Con
trol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to addre
ss 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Gratton School held a public hearing on September 9, 2019 and determined that each school within the
 
District has sufficient and good quality textbooks, 
instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs the State of California. All stud
ents are given their own 
individual standards aligned textbooks  and/or instru
ctional materials in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the State Department of Education, making the textbooks
 
used in the school the 
most current av
ailable. Standards aligned materials are reviewed by the certificated staff   and a recommendation is made to the School Boar
d.  All 
recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. The table displays inf
ormation about the quality, 
currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or 
programs of study
