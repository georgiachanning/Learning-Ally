Principal's Message
 
O
n behalf of the entire Muscatel Middle School family, I welcome all of our students to an exciting 
educational experience. It is 
our goal to provide an engaging learning environment where all 
students are able to participate in challenging activities that promote academic achievement, 
personal growth, and a sense of belonging. In order to help achieve this goal, parents, students, 
s
taff, and community leaders work together as a team to create an outstanding educational 
organization.  We are happy to have you join the Muscatel family!
 
 
Mission Statement
 
Muscatel Middle School is dedicated to student success by providing a rigorous edu
cation, 
leadership opportunities, and collaboration between students and the school community.
 
 
Community & School Profile
 

Rosemead School District educates ju
st under 2400 pre
-
kindergarten through eighth grade 
students in the diverse community of Rosemead. Founded in 1859, the district is proud of its long 
tradition of academic excellence. There are currently four elementary schools (pre
-
K
-
6) and one 
middle sch
ool (7
-
8) in the district; students from Rosemead School District attend Rosemead High 
School, which is part of the El Monte Union High School District. Rosemead School District believes 
in providing a challenging academic environment with high expectation
s and placing student needs 
as its number one priority.
 
 
At Muscatel, it is our belief that students do their best when a challenging academic environment 
is combined with fun and engaging activities. We are dedicated to providing the very best programs 
fo
r our students.
 
 
Muscatel Middle School is proud to offer the Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) 

-
 
3.5, and who may be the first of their 
family members to attend college. We provide a
n engaging curriculum with enrichment classes and 
supplemental activities to prepare students with the skills required to be successful in post
-
secondary education. Our goal is to become a demonstration school for this program.
 
 
Muscatel makes use of the M
y Access writing program.  This technology
-
based program allows 
students to write compositions on a regular basis and receive feedback on their writing within 
minutes. Students are enthusiastic about writing 
--
 
and their writing skills have improved as a r
esult.  
This has led to a significant increase on state test scores.  Our school also offers 1:1 chrome books 
in every classroom for students to use for writing, research, and classroom assignments.  Many 
teachers utilize google classroom and have students
 
engage with texts and assignments in a 
creative way, learning the skills required for the use of such a platform.  These skills are in 
compliance with our goal of preparing students to be successful in the world of work and academia 
in the  21st century. 
 
We have also just opened a Maker's Space for students to go to during lunch 
time and after school.  In this environment, students are encouraged to be creative with art or use 
their imaginations to build projects of their own designs, such as cars and rob
ots.  We are dedicated 
in continuing to adopt new and exciting programs to stimulate a love of learning and academic 
success in all of our students.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every schoo
l in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local edu
cational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additional
ly, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde
.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
comm
unity members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

al programs. Rosemead 
School District held a public hearing and determined that textbooks, instr
uctional materials, and science lab equipment were sufficient and of good 
quality at each school within the district, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students,
 
including English learners, are 
given their own  standar
ds
-
aligned textbooks and instructional materials in core subjects for use in the classroom and at home. All textbooks and 
instructional materials are aligned with the California State Content Standards and Frameworks and have been approved by the 
Board of 
Trustees. 
Rosemead School District follows the State Instructional Materials Adoption Cycle that reviews instructional materials in eac
h curricular area within a six
-
year cycle. The chart below illustrates the textbooks currently in use at our school. All 
textbooks are in adequate supply and fair to excellent condition. 
100% of students in each core subject area possess the necessary textbooks and instructional materials.
 
 
Textbooks and fictional books available to students at Muscatel include text both in 
English and Spanish. The school also has well

stocked classroom 
libraries with engaging titles for independent reading, including titles selected with English Learners in mind.  Computers a
t the school are connected to 
the internet via a high speed connect
ion so that students are able to access resources and information online and develop their research skills. The school 
is working to integrate computer skills and concepts across the curriculum. Every classroom is equipped with 1

of students who met 
or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the standard 
(i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note:
 
Double dashes (

oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes al

the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only
 
students who received scores.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Muscatel Middle School is a closed campus. During school hours, the entrance is secured to ensure visitors check in with the 
front office. All visitors are 
requir
ed to sign in and to wear visitor badges during their stay. While visits by parents and community members are welcomed, anyon
e wishing to be on 
campus during school hours should notify staff ahead of time. During lunch, breaks, and before and after school,
 
yard supervisors and teachers supervise 
students and school grounds, including the cafeteria and playgrounds, to ensure a safe and orderly environment.
 
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the District to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 
187) of 1997. The plan provides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Our safe school plan includes the following requirements of SB 1
87: current status of school 
crime; child abuse reporting procedures; routine an
d emergency disaster procedures; policies related to suspension and expulsion, and notification to 
teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and school employees; safe and 
orderly
 
school environment; and school rules and procedures. We are now using the Document Tracking Services System to assist in time
ly changes to 
our plan.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and updates it as needed. The plan was last updated and approved b
y School Site Council on February 4, 2020. 
Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Plan, are reviewed by Muscatel's Safe Schools Committee, consisting 
of teachers, students, 
classified staff, and administration.  Additionally, our plan is 
reviewed with school and district staff throughout the school year during various safety 
training opportunities and emergency drills.
