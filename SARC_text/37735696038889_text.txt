School Description
 
North Terrace Elementary is proud to share information about our school in this annual School 
Accountability Report Card. The purpose of this report card is to afford you further insight into the 
quality educational program we offer. We want to begin by th
anking you for taking time to learn 
more about us.
 
 
Our community is committed to providing a challenging and engaging learning environment for all 
students.  We strive to instill the essential 21st Century Skills of Collaboration, 
Communication, 
Critical Thinking, and Creativity that our students need to be successful in today's colleges and 
careers.    We strive to provide opportunities for success in both collaborative and individual 
achievement in such areas as literacy, and math
ematics, as well as positive personal experiences 
which facilitate self
-
discipline, decision
-
making, problem
-
solving, conflict resolution, life 
management, social responsibility, and an appreciation of cultural diversity.
 
 
We believe each child is unique a
nd deserving of a rich educational environment. We work hard 
every day to ensure that students receive a balanced and rigorous educational program. We believe 
in a student
-

, 
and intellectual needs are addressed. All students have special talents and are given the 
opportunities to develop those talents.  Through a DoDEA grant our students in grades 1
-
8 receive 
1:1 iPads and Kindergarten uses iPads within their classroom group
 
rotations.  Teachers have 
received continuing PD in implementation of technology to improve teacher practice and enhance 
student learning.
 
 
North Terrace prides itself on involving the parents and community members in every aspect of our 
school. We welcom
e visitors on our campus for many different reasons including: direct support 
within the classroom, PTO sponsored assemblies and field trips, evening events such as Family 
Game Nights and our Fall Festival, and active participation in School Site Council, 
Parent Conference 
Week, and Back to School Night. We believe that parents, community members, and staff must 
work together to ensure the success of all students.  North Terrace parents and the community at 
large are highly supportive of the educational pro
gram at North Terrace Elementary School. 
Therefore, various programs and activities are enriched by the contributions made by Oceanside 
Unified School District, foundations, community organizations, and local businesses.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Californi
a is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agenc
ies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data repor
ted in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/
ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members 
should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priorit
y 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessme
nts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards,
 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students w
ho met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated 
in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievem
ent level percentages are calculated using only students who received scores.

Parent involvement is an important part of our successful learning community.   Our staff welcomes parent 
participation in our classrooms and 
throughout our campus in order to build upon our strong home
-
school partnership.  Parents are also encouraged to become involved in our many school
-
wide events and activities, such as student awards assemblies, school da
nces, our Tiger running club, our annual Bike and Safety Rodeo, and our annual 
Fall Festival.  Our strong PTO offers multiple ways for parents to connect with our school, and we are always open to new ide
as and suggestions to make 
North Terrace an even bet
ter environment for our families.
 
 
Parents and community partners are a vital part of our amazing school. Our School Site Council develops and approves our 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement and our Safe School Plan. Our PTO has a dedicated core group of 
volunteers who support the school's efforts to provide a positive learning 
environment for all students. To find out how you can volunteer at our school, please contact us at (760) 901

School Safety Plan
 
Students at North Terrace are guided by school
-
wide and classroom expectations that promote respect, cooperation, courtesy, and acceptance of others. 
Our Safe School Plan was last reviewed by
 
our School Site Council in May, 2018, and includes goals to promote a safe, bully
-
free, secure, and clean 
learning environment where students can thrive.  The 8 Keys of Excellence character education program promotes a safe school 
and a warm, friendly 
cla
ssroom environment as a solid foundation upon which to build an effective school. Additionally, our Tiger Code promotes posit
ive behavior and 
resilience by reminding all members of our community to do their best and never give up. The goal is to provide st
udents with opportunities to learn self
-
discipline through a system of incentives and consequences for behavior. Students are reminded of school expectations through
out the year through 
daily morning announcements, classroom postings, regular notices, asse
mblies, and parent conferences. Students who exemplify characteristics of good 
behavior are also rewarded at recognition assemblies.
 
 
North Terrace promotes a calm, friendly, and positive learning environment by working proactively to create a safe, clean,
 
and secure campus. Our policy 
clearly states that bullying at school is not acceptable and that every child has a right to be safe. The gates surrounding o
ur campus are locked during 
academic hours to ensure the safety of our students. All visitors are re
quired to sign in at our front office and display an identification badge at all times 
while on campus. Our Campus Supervisor and duty supervisors monitor student playground behavior and work proactively to preve
nt disruptions while 
promoting kindness and 
respect.  Positive behavior expectations provide a solid foundation on which to build an effective school. Students are expec
ted 
to come to class prepared, behave in a manner conducive to a positive learning environment, respect the rights of others, and
 
f
ollow our Tiger Code of 
safety, respect, and responsibility.

Number of classes indicates how many classrooms fall into each size category (a range of total students per classroom). At th
e secondary school level, this information 
is reported by subject area rather than grade level.
 
 
Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take time each year to i
mprove their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. During the 2016
--
2017 school 
year the following Professional Learning occurred: Common Core English Language Arts and Mathematics; Guided Reading ; Lucy C
alkins Writing;
 
Reading 
and Writing Workshop; and 21st Century Skills and Technology Implementation.  During the 2017
-
2018 school year our staff continued working with our 
district program specialists to increase and improve implementation of ELA, Math, and Technology in
 
the classroom.  We also continued our focus on 
inquiry
-
based learning, and used funding from a DoDEA grant to implement Project Lead the Way, an inquiry and project
-
based learning science program.  
This learning will continue in the 2018
-
2019 school year,
 
along with additional training in the use of student discourse to improve communication and 
learning across all of the content area.
