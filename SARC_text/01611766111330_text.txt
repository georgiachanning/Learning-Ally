About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is requ
ired by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California 
public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs
) are 
required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. 
Additionally, data reported in an
 
LCAP is to be consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC 
web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should co
ntact 
the school principal or the district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the
 
Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core classes for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are
 
the most recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Opened in 1993, Forest Park Elementary is a beautifully designed school. The site covers more than 61,000 square feet. It has
 
expansive halls, large 
courtyards, 36 classrooms, a multipurpose room, and 
a multimedia center that consists of a computer lab, a television studio and a library. All areas of 
the facility are handicapped accessible. The school and playground are adjacent to Frank Fisher Park, which is used for PE, r
ecess and lunch play, and 
othe
r outdoor activities. Forest Park has three gender inclusive bathrooms for student and staff use.
 
 
The students learn civic and environmental responsibilities through activities such as a recycling program. Our campus is bea
utifully maintained. The 
buildin
gs and restrooms are cleaned daily, and all toilets are in working order. The school has one day
-
time and two and a half night
-
time custodians. 
These custodians and the services of district maintenance and gardening crews ensure that the school is cleaned 
and maintained. The district 
maintenance staff works very hard to ensure that necessary repairs are completed in a timely manner. The maintenance staff us
es a work order process 
to ensure that service is efficient and that emergency repairs are given the h
ighest priority. The maintenance team comes to Forest Park on a rotating 
basis to complete odd jobs. We have recently installed hand dryers in all bathrooms to cut down on our paper towel usage and 
carbon footprint.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facil
ities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the Facilities 

ons you see
 
on this report. 
Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report. Since that time, those
 
conditions may have changed.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

At Forest Park, teachers, administrators, support staff, and families are collaborators in the success of all students. More 
than 90 percent of our families 
annually attend Back
-
to
-
School Night an
d Open House. Additionally, Forest Park citizens all celebrate diversity through school wide activities like the 
United Nations Parade.  Forest Park teachers use the 8 Great Traits of caring, respect, citizenship, planning & decision maki
ng, honesty, probl
em solving, 
responsibility, and integrity to support character education and growth in all students and celebrate students who demonstrat
e the monthly trait.
 
 
Parent and family volunteerism is high at our school. Volunteers have dedicated countless hours o
f time to participate in the activities that support the 
curriculum and student success. Teachers encourage parents to assist with math, language, and writing labs; listen to readers
; monitor small groups; 
make presentations about cultural celebrations suc
h as the Hindu festival Diwali; or demonstrate an area of expertise such as origami, painting, or 
calligraphy. Almost 100 parents come out annually to support our school
-
wide fundraiser, The Walk of the Wolverines.
 
 
Our plan for family involvement in decis
ion making includes a built
-
in system of school advisory and leadership committees. These committees include 
the School Site Council (SSC); English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC);  PTA Harmony,  technology, safety, yearbook, and P
TA. Parents also organ
ize 
and run a Health & Safety Fair, Red Ribbon Week, Reflections, Family Fun Nights, Pictures with Santa, and Student Talent Show
cases. During the 2016
-
17 PTA, which had one of the highest membership levels in the bay area, sponsored school wide assemblies
, community events, fund

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; an
d
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Forest Park provides a safe, functional, and nurturing environment that supports student learning. The safety and security of
 
our students is a top priority. 
Staff monitors the school gro
unds for 15 minutes before and 15 minutes after school as well as at all recesses and at lunch time. Each teacher carries a 
radio while on duty in order to have instant communication with the front office. During all supervision times, teachers wear
 
a vest
 
and carry walkie 
talkies. Teachers regularly review the rules for safe, responsible behavior in the classroom and on the playground. We have a
 
closed campus where 
visitors must enter the school through the main door and sign in at the office using a secur
e online platform, an then they receive a sticker identifying 
them as a visitor and wear it throughout their stay. During drills office staff take iPads out  to help Students going out of
 
class must do so in pairs and 
carry a hall pass.
 
 
Our student 
Safety Patrol helps children cross the street safely before and after school. These students are specially trained and model 
the pinnacle of 
Forest Park good citizenship by serving their fellow students as traffic monitors. For student safety, a faculty me
mber is present to support the Safety 
Patrol at all times, parent volunteers also assist in this endeavor. In addition, our parent
-
run valet provides a safe way for students to be dropped off 
before class and picked up after school and it helps control the
 
flow of traffic. Parents drive into our driveway and students are assisted out of or into 
their cars by students identified by their orange safety vests.
 
 
Our School Safety Plan was last updated in March 2019 and annually each school year. Parts of the 
plan are revisited throughout the school year by our 
Safety Committee to ensure optimal safety. Key elements of the plan include district safety policies, Forest Park discipline 


Plan. Fire drills are held once a month and disaster drills are held four times a year. Drills Forest Park also 
participates each you in the Great Shake Out drill to promote earthquake safety. Each classroom has an emergency backpack wit
h necessary supplie
s 
and information in case of emergency and the school has two storage containers stocked with emergency supplies for students a
nd staff. FUSD provides 
supplies for all students for a 3 day emergency. Forest Park teachers are all trained by officers from th
e Fremont Police Department to respond accurately 
to an Active Shooter or lock down, should these situations occur.
 
 
Finally, our school safety plan includes the emotional safety of all students. All students attend an Anti
-
bullying assembly in the beginni
ng of the year to 
prevent bullying and all 4
-
6 grade students receive "A Preventing Sexual Harassment" presentation during their first two months of school. Forest Park 
has two part time counselors that serve students individually and provide whole class i
nstruction on topics ranging from anti
-
bullying to responding to 
peer pressure. These counselors also provide small group instruction in conflict management and social skills.
