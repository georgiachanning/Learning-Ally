School Description
 
Rancho Santa Fe School District, located in Rancho Santa Fe, CA operates two schools on a single 
site; an elementary school that serves 
students in Kindergarten 
-
 
fifth grade and a middle school 
that serves students in grades 6 
-
 
8.  District enrollment is just under 600 students from the 
communities of Rancho Santa Fe, Elfin Forest, El Cielo, and The Bridges. The Rancho Santa Fe 
community
 
is comprised of just over 3,000 people.  We are committed to being the school of choice 
within our community.  RSF students move on to attend the high performing public high schools in 
the San Dieguito School District.
 
 
The school was completely renovated
 
in 2010 at a cost of $35 million using voter approved bond 
funds. It boasts a beautiful campus with an administration building, five classroom buildings, a 
performing arts center, a gymnasium, three playgrounds, and an athletic field.  Our state of the ar
t 
classrooms are equipped with interactive whiteboards, document cameras, a one
-
to
-
one ratio of 
ipads to students, and flexible seating. The school is adjacent to the Rancho Santa Fe Public Library 
and the Rancho Santa Fe Community Center.  Both partner wi
th the school to provide programs 
and after school care.
 
 
The Rancho Santa Fe School District is one of the oldest districts in San Diego County and has a 
longstanding history of academic success.  We are proud of our rigorous curriculum and instruction 
in
 
core subjects, as well as providing a comprehensive enrichment program of music, art, and 
technology.  We are committed to engaging students in their learning, fostering their creativity, 
supporting their efforts, and giving them many opportunities to lea
rn their strengths and explore 
their passions.  Our students also engage in an organized athletic program each week at the 
elementary school, and many options for PE credit at the middle school including team sports.  
Before and after school offerings incl
ude choir, instrumental music, athletics, and robotics for all 
grade levels.
 
 
Our character education program teaches students to have exceptional character and to be 
personally responsible, accountable, and aware of their impact on others. We are a caring
 
community that promotes mutual respect, interdependence, global awareness, and service to 
others.  To that end, our Student Council organizes school wide philanthropic campaigns that 
benefit childhood diseases, animal welfare, etc.
 
 
Our parents are very i
nvolved in the education of their children.  They support the work of the 
school through volunteering in the classrooms, helping with special events, e.g. Father/Daughter 
Dance, Mother/Son Bowling Outing, and the annual art auction.  We have an Education F
oundation 
that raises funds each year to support our programs.
 
 
Unlike many elementary schools, RSF families are the third and fourth generation to attend R. Roger 
Rowe Elementary School. One of our most heart warming and celebrated events is Grandparents 
and Special Friends Day where multiple generations of RSF families attend elementary music and 
drama performances, as well as spend time in their children's classrooms. It is very special to 
grandparents, parents, and students who spend time together in a 
school that is "home" for each 
of them.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Many people visit the campus to volunteer in the classroom and participate in school events. Parents and visitors are 
welcomed, required to check in at 

ors are required to return to the 
school office upon their departure. Before and after school and
 
during lunch, instructional aides and teachers monitor campus activity and ensure student 
safety. The campus is monitored by security surveillance cameras.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan was developed by the district to comply with Senate Bill 187 
(SB 187) of 1997. The plan provides students and 
staff a means of ensuring a safe and an orderly learning environment. Each school includes the following requirements of SB 1
87 within their safe school 
plans: current status of school crime; child abuse rep
orting procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to suspension and 
expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and school 
e
mployees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and updates it as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Comprehensive S
chool Safety Plan, are 
reviewed with school and di
strict staff in the fall, at the start of each school year.  A copy of the plan is available for public review at the school 
office.
 
 

ster, and lockdown drills are 
conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year. The school has implemented the Bright Arrow emergency communication 
system that allows 
the district to place up to 25,000 telephone calls and text messages to emergency 
contacts within 15 minutes.

Temporary and probationary teachers are formally evaluated twice a year and tenured teachers are evaluated once a year. All t
eachers are observed 
informally on an ongoing basis during the s
chool year. Evaluation criteria based on the California Standards for the Teaching Profession include: engaging 
and supporting all students in learning; creating and maintaining effective environments for student learning; understanding 
and organizing subj
ect 
matter for student learning; planning instruction and designing learning experiences for all students; assessing student lear
ning; developing as a 
professional educator.
 
 
Teachers work collaboratively in professional learning communities for a minimum 
of two hours per week when students are engaged in enrichment 
classes with certificated teachers.  In addition, teachers have late start Mondays where District

for the district's new math and science adoptions.
