By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

SCHOOL PROFILE:
 
Lake View Elementary School, located in Huntington Beach, California, is one of ten elementary schools in the Ocean View 
School Distri
ct.  The school serves a population of approximately 420 students in Transitional Kindergarten through fifth 
grade.  Lake View  underwent a complete modernization and remodel in the 2015
-
2016 school year.  Lake View is a diverse 
population, 35% English lea
rners and 63% socioeconomically disadvantaged.  In addition to 15 general education 
classrooms, Lake View houses three special education classes that serve moderate to severely disabled students.  Lake 
View offers a full day Transitional Kindergarten and K
indergarten program, same hours as the first through third grade 
students.  Fourth and fifth grade students have an additional hour of instruction.  Wednesdays are a modified schedule to 
allow the staff an opportunity for professional learning and collabor
ative planning.
 
 
In September 2016, the school implemented a comprehensive student
-
centered STEAM (Science, Technology, 
Engineering, Arts, and Math) curricular model.  Students are immersed in an innovative STEAM curriculum during the 
entire school day and
 
engaged in Project
-
Based Learning experiences.  The curricular model is differentiated to meet the 
diverse learning needs of the students within the classroom setting.
 
 
All students in the school have daily access to technology.  Each classroom is equippe
d with a Promethean Multi

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
In November of 2016, the Ocean View School District (OVSD) passed Measure R, a general obligation bond, in the amount 
of 169 million dollars. This is the first bond ever passed in 
the 143 year history of OVSD. The bond program is designed to 
transform the aging fleet of 1960/1970 era schools into modern, contemporary learning environments. Construction 
started in late June of 2018 and is anticipated to take approximately eight years
 
to complete ending somewhere in the 
2024/2025 school year.
 
 
The District currently embraces a systematic approach to maintaining the current facilities to ensure that all schools are 
clean, safe, and provide an inspirational educational environment for our students to learn, grow, and be challenged. 
District mainte
nance and site custodial staff work in a coordinated manner to ensure that the repairs and operational 
items necessary to keep the schools in good condition are completed in a timely manner. A comprehensive work order 
system is utilized by school and Distr
ict staff to communicate both routine and non
-
routine maintenance requests. 
Emergency repairs are given the highest priority. 
 
 
From an operational perspective, the custodian inspects the facilities for safety hazards or other conditions that need 
attentio
n prior to students and staff entering school grounds. One full
-
time day custodian and one or two part
-
time 
evening custodian(s) are assigned to each school site. The day custodian is responsible for:
 

 
Lunch area setup/cleanup
 

 
General grounds maintenance

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

The days represented above only represent opportunities that ALL 
teachers participate in throughout the year. District 
committee work or content area teams training are not calculated in the total above. Elementary has 2 non

student days 
of training, 1 day of site
-
based foundational skills training, and 1.5 days to anal
yze data and develop an action plan totaling 
4.5 days for ALL elementary teachers. Middle School also has the 2 non

student days and the 1.5 data days totaling 3.5 
days for ALL middle school teachers.
 
There are two non
-
student days included in the District
 
calendar that focus on professional learning each year. At 
elementary sites Wednesdays are modified days. Students are released early to allow time for teachers to focus on 
professional learning, collaboration, and planning. Two Wednesdays a month are dev
oted to professional learning and 
collaboration and the other two Wednesdays are for collaboration and teacher planning. Middle School will have 10 early 
release Thursdays starting in the 2019
-
2020 school year to allow for professional learning, collaborat
ion, and planning as 
well. There are also 1.5 days allotted to each school site to review data and create planned actions based on the data. 
Other professional learning opportunities are made available for teachers who are representing their school and bri
nging 
back information and professional learning provided for school site administrators to bring back and share with staff.
 
Ocean View School District has a Roadmap that is collaboratively developed with stakeholders. This Roadmap defines the 
professional
 
development needs of the students and staff across the district. It is also used to develop the Local Control 
Accountability Plan (LCAP) and School Plans (SPSA). The focus for the professional learning in TK
-
5 schools has been on 
Foundational Skills for L
iteracy, Diagnostic assessments to inform instruction, and using a toolkit of resources to 
differentiate instruction for all students. In middle school the focus has been on developing and implementing new 
integrated science units, writing in science, and 
training teachers to conduct a History
-
Social Science pilot of instructional 
materials. All schools have been working on Social
-
Emotional learning, Positive Behavior Instructional Support (PBIS), and 
some of the schools have been trained in restorative pra
ctices.
