By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:

Community Day School sets a high priority upon 
ensuring that there are sufficient textbooks and materials to support the 
school educational program. Textbook selection is done by the District, grade level, and subject area committees 
coordinated by District curriculum. All texts must be adopted from th
e most recent approved State matrices or local 
governing board approved lists. Textbook purchases are consistent with the content cycles of the California Curriculum 
Frameworks as District Instructional Material Funding and other funding sources permit. Ca
tegorical funding also allows 
us to purchase supplementary instructional materials for English Learners in kindergarten to fifth grades to accelerate 
pupils as rapidly as possible towards grade level proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking. These mat
erials are used in 
addition to the basic Reading/Language Arts and other core materials provided for every student and are correlated to 
State Standards
-
aligned textbooks each year with new adoption cycles per core area.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Professional development has become part of the daily work life of the Earlimart teaching teams. Teachers, administrators 
and support staff participate in workshops and seminars, coach one another, plan lessons together along with our Literacy 
Coaches, and
 
collaborate for the purpose of student achievement. The professional learning community understands that 
teachers need collaboration time with one another. As a result, there is much support for providing the time and resources 
teachers require for the pu
rpose of changing their practice. Teachers are afforded opportunities to participate in 
curriculum development, learn and share successful methods of reaching students, discuss comprehensive and efficient 
ways to implement standards, and continue their own
 
learning.

For the 2015
-
16 school year, Earlimart's primary area of focus for staff development is on academic language and 
vocabulary, early literacy skills, English Language Development, and further understanding of the Common Core State 
Standards.  The
se areas were selected due to the student achievement data collected in the areas of language arts, English 
Language Development (CELDT), and mathematics.  The methods of professional development delivery have been 
workshops before the school year, during 
school days with release time, attendance at conferences both local and in other 
areas, on site coaching with TCOE consultants, as well as on site coaching with Earlimart content experts.  Teachers are 
supported during implementation through in
-
class coach
ing, lesson planning assistance, demonstration lessons, principal 
and district walk
-
throughs, TCOE experts on site and during walk
-
throughs, as well as common planning time at the end 
of the school day.
