Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The school was built in the mid 1950's. There have been a number of improvements to the facility in recent years. During 
the summer of 2019 we added a shade structure the new Multi Purpose Room, whic
h was completed during 2015. We 
Added a new electronic digital sign in front of Cloverland in 2015. The Library and Computer Lab were both updated during 
2016. New child
-
friendly basketball "bowls were added in 2016 as well. In 2017 the front student drop 
off and crossing 
area on Johnson Street was re
-
designed. A stop sign that had been requested for many years was added on Johnson and 
"D" streets, making a much safer area. Permanent soccer goals were added during 2017.
 
 
Currently, we are in the process of 
adding remote control bus gates for Kindergarten drop off each day in order to keep 
students safe. Additionally, we are working on remodeling the old kitchen to make it a teacher work room. We will move 
the VP office to the current work room. We hope to ad
d a PAR course to add to strength and conditioning for our students 
during PE and recess time. Lastly, we hope to replace the 3,4,5 and 6 grade aging play structure over the next year.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs 
of study.

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number 
of students who met the standard

Staff development and training opportunities are based on 
student achievement data and teacher input and needs.  The 
district has an ongoing professional development plan which involves teachers being released for the school day to 
participate in professional learning events.  Ongoing support for the implementati
on of new content is provided by district 
academic coaches, grade
-
level/department peers, and administrators.  Site professional development occurs in the form 
of micro
-
lessons that happen during staff meetings. Those training sessions are delivered by sit
e administrators, teachers 
and academic coaches.
