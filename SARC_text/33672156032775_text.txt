Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Victoria was built in 1956 when the surrounding area was rural orange groves. Modernization of the entire campus was 
completed in 1996. In 2013, front perimeter fencing was installed to ensure that all visitors check into the office and 
rec
eive a pass. The gates remain locked until dismissal time. The surrounding neighborhood is relatively free of crime and 
the school has experienced little vandalism and graffiti over the past few years.
 
Many special programs are available for students:

students to achieve academic success."
 
Victoria School's Staff BELIEVES!
 
We BE
LIEVE every child has value. All students have special talents and abilities. We can tap into their strengths. Therefore, 
we will identify student strengths and provide opportunities for all students to explore their special talents and abilities.
 
We will 
use these strengths to motivate students. We BELIEVE every student can rise to teachers' expectations. Setting 
high expectations provides students opportunities for growth and achievement.  Therefore, we will plan rigorous 
instruction, scaffolding prior kn
owledge. We will set daily goals (objectives) and show them how to reach them. We 
BELIEVE children need to have self
-
esteem. Therefore, we will let them know we value them by actively seeking the 
positives and acknowledging them. We will positively reinfor
ce desired behavior and academic efforts. We BELIEVE we 
are a collaborative team. Our learning community is responsible for everyone. Therefore, we will collaboratively analyze 
data and plan for improved instruction based on current reality. We BELIEVE we 
create the culture of the school. Attitude 
is everything. Therefore, we model a "we can and will succeed" attitude. We will minimize the negative and accentuate 
the positive. We BELIEVE all children deserve a safe, caring, positive, enriching learning envi
ronment. Everyone should be 
treated with respect. Therefore, we will consistently implement the school discipline plan. We will review school and 
classroom rules on a regular basis throughout the year.

equipment, where appropriate, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State 
of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core 
subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are a
dopted according to a 
6
-
year cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most 
current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to
 
the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption
 
 
Riverside Unified School District adopts instructional materials on
 
a regular schedule based on State adoptions. All 
students receive appropriate, up

Parents and families play an important role in the education of our students. When parents and teachers work together 
on behalf of students,
 
the results are powerful. Each year families receive a parent handbook that contains information 
about programs and procedures at Victoria School. In this information is also a Home
-
School Compact. This compact 
outlines responbilities between the school, 
parent, and student that are required to have a successful school year. Because 
we believe that communication is key, Victoria has many systems in place. Each grade level team sends home newsletters 
to inform parents about the curriculum that will be taugh
t and ways they can help at home. In addition, parents receive 
the Victoria Newsletter which includes articles and calendars. Parents are encouraged to visit the RUSD website at 
www.riversideunified.org, our school website at http://victoria.riversideunifi
ed.org/ , our school Facebook at 
facebook.com@RUSDVictoria, and our PTO Facebook https://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Victoria

Elementary
-
PTO/327234801032 as well as our Instagram page at #Victoriaeaglesrusd to obtain information about parents and 
curriculum 
resources and current school news. The school marquee also posts information about meetings, holidays, and 
school
-
wide events 
-
 
many of which are also emailed and/or communicated via our automated phone system.
 
 
Parents and community members are encouraged
 
to take advantage of the many opportunities that are available to 
become involved at Victoria. Joining the PTO, serving on parent committees, volunteering in the classroom and library, 
attending parent training classes, ensuring that their children come t
o school every day on time and complete nightly 
homework, and participating at school events are just a few ways to become involved. 
 
 
There are various parent groups at Victoria School. 
 

 
Victoria has an active and involved PTO which works on behalf of stu
dents, families, and teachers. This group 
meets monthly on the second Tuesday of the month.
 

 
The Victoria Outdoor Education booster club (OE) fundraises and plans for sixth grade science camp in which 
each student attends for one week in the San Gorgonial m
ountains (at no cost to the family).
 

 
School Site Council (SSC) is a committee that oversees the School Categorical Budget and monitors the 
implementation of Victoria's School Library and Improvement Plan. The committee is comprised of Victoria's 
teachers, 
classified staff, and parents. This group meets the third Thursday of each month.
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) is comprised of parents of English Language Learners. This 
committee meets concurrently with the SSC meetings. Meeting topics includ
