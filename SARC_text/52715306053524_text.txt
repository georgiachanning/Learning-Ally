About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Flournoy Union Elementary School held a public hearing on September 10, 2019, and determined that the school had sufficient a
nd good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab eq
uipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards

aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are re
viewed by all teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers paraprofessional, administrators and
 
parents/community 
members. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the dist
rict/school office prior to adoption. The table displays information 
about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

lounge, 1 
cafeteria/multipurpose room and 1 playground. Cleaning Process: The custodian (part

ents. 
Typically this includes roof
ing, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parent
al Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The staff of Flournoy Union Elementary 
School District believes that providing students with a quality education is a team effort between home and 


se 
parent involvement is especially critical during the adolescent years, we encourage parents to learn about the school and its
 
programs, become more 
involved in school functions, and maintain open lines of communication.

One of the easiest ways to becom
e involved at Flournoy is to volunteer. Parent volunteers assist on field trips, run book fairs, organize picture days.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil 
expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Flournoy Union Elementary. The school is always in compliance with all l
aws, rules, and regulations 
pertaining to h
azardous materials and state earthquake standards. The School Site Safety plan was last reviewed and updated on October 2019 
by the 
school staff and board of education. All revisions were communicated to the both the classified and certificated staff. The 

plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a (mon
thly/regular) basis throughout 
the school year. Lockdown drills are held throughout the year. Studen
ts are supervised before and after school by certificated and classified staff. 
Certificated staff/classified staff help with supervision during lunch and break periods. There is a designated area for stud
ent drop off and pick up. Visitors 
must sign in and
 
out and wear a name badge while on campus.
