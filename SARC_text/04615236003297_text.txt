By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Palermo Union School District is located approximately six miles south of Oroville, the county seat of Butte County. 
The Palermo community is a rural, agricultural community encompassing 
an area of 75 square miles. The District consists 
of five schools: Helen Wilcox (K
-
3), Honcut (K
-
3), Golden Hills (4
-
5), Palermo (6
-
8), and the Palermo Community Day School 
(K
-
8). The Palermo School campus is located in the center of the Palermo community 
and has an enrollment of 
approximately 482 students. The total district enrollment is approximately 1,467 students.
 
 
Palermo School's goal is to insure that all students have the opportunity and support needed to meet or exceed the grade 
level standards, a
t a minimum,attaining proficiency or advanced proficiency in reading and mathematics. State 
standardized and local measures of academic growth, both formative and summative, are monitored weekly, each 
trimester, and at the end of the school year. We provid
e a standards based education for all students via the 
implementation and support of a Professional Learning Communities model. The teaching staff and administrators 
continue to develop and implement curriculum, programs and strategies to assist students i
n achieving and/or exceeding 
grade level standards. Intervention strategies/opportunities are built into the school day for students who have not 
mastered grade level standards. Certificated teachers also provide after school tutoring at all grade levels.
 
 
The Mission of Palermo School and the Palermo Union School District is to provide a variety of educational programs, in a 
safe and mutually respectful environment that are effective, accessible, and equitable; prepare students for leadership, 
employment, 
and citizenship; and promote students' intellectual, ethical, cultural, emotional, moral, social, and physical 
growth. Working together with students, families, and community in a cooperative effort, we will provide a rigorous, 
standards based educational 
program to ensure that all students are successful life
-
long learners, in a safe, caring, moral, 
drug free, and supportive environment, with the ultimate goal that they will become successful, productive, and 
responsible citizens.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
In compliance with Ed Code 35329.6, the District Comprehensive Safety Plan/Emergency Management Plan is reviewed, 
updated, and approved by the Governing Board annually by 
March 1. Each school maintains a copy of the Safety Plan on 
site and a copy of the site Emergency Conditions portion of the plan in each classroom. Key elements of the Safety Plan 
include: a plan of action for maintaining a safe and orderly environment con
ducive to learning at the school 
(i.e.:assessment of school safety, identification of strategies and programs that will maintain school safety and campus 
security) and emergency management procedures consistent with the Standardized Emergency Management Sy
stem 
(SEMS) and the National Incident Management System (NIMS) developed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
 
 
Key elements of the site Emergency Conditions include: a plan of action for a coordinated school wide response to 
emergencies (i.e. intru
der on campus, fire, emergency lockdown, evacuation, etc). Safety drills are held on a regular basis. 
Fire drills are held monthly. Earthquake/disaster and intruder drills are held twice a year. Visitors to the campus are 
required to sign in at the school

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018

Palermo School provides standards based, high quality instruction to all students in all subject areas. In 
addition, we also 
provide additional academic support and supplemental services through the use of intervention classes within the school 
day and after school tutoring. Achievement data and student progress is regularly monitored in order to ensure that 
st
udents are assigned to appropriate classes and intervention services. Students that are not meeting grade level 
standards also receive instructional support from our educational specialist staff.
 
 
Title VII funding is used to provide Indian Education stude
nts with additional academic support from an instructional aide 
who provides in
-
class assistance. English Language Learners who have not yet reached fluency receive approximately 40 
minutes of English Language instruction daily in addition to their core Re
ading/ELA classes in 6th grade. In the 7th/8th 
grades these students are in an ELA/ELD block where they receive designated ELD instruction.
 
 
Title I funding supports improvement of the teaching and learning of children who are at risk of not meeting academ
ic 
standards and reside in areas with high concentration of children from low
-
income families. We have implemented a PBIS 
behavior system and counseling services are provided. We also have implemented a computerized intervention program 
in math and ELA as 
well as another that addresses social/emotional concerns.
