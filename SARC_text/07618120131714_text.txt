By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

 
 
Tice Creek School opened in August 2015 as a distr
ict specialized community K

8 school. Enrollment is open to families 
who reside within the attendance boundaries of the Walnut Creek School District through the intra
-
district transfer 
process. If there are more applicants than space, a lottery is held.
 
 
B
y approaching instruction of Common Core State Standards through Project Based Learning (PBL), students are 
challenged to work on real
-
world problems with real
-

of 21st
-
century learning: col
laboration, critical thinking, creativity and communication. As students research a driving 
question, classes often enlist the support of an industry expert to guide students and offer feedback on attempted 
projects. Each PBL unit ends with a product or ou
tcome which often is presented to an authentic audience. Throughout 
this process, students are encouraged to engage in the cycle of inquiry: asking questions, seeking answers and developing 
new questions along the way.

Year and month in which data were 
collected:
 
September 23, 2019
 
 
The state of California requires that each child have a current standards
-
based textbook in each of the four core areas of 
instruction. As a part of this requirement, Walnut Creek School District has purchased editions for te
aching language arts 
(reading, writing, speaking and listening), science, social science, mathematics and health. We are fortunate to have a 
music text (K
-
5) for our students and a music specialist who meets with all of the classes. Our foreign
-
language te
xts are 
also up
-
to
-
date. Thus, all textbooks in the Walnut Creek School District are current, standards
-
based, and consistent with 
the content and cycles of the Curriculum Frameworks and adopted and approved by the State Board of Education.
 
 
We have an abu
ndance of supplementary reading materials at varying levels of difficulty in each of our elementary 
classrooms that are integrated across all core curricular areas. These leveled reading materials provide students with 
experiences in reading narrative as w
ell as expository text.
 
 
The Walnut Creek School District governing board held a public hearing on September 23, 2019 and affirmed that each 
pupil, including English learners, has his or her own textbook to use in class and to take home.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Tice Creek School has 26 classrooms in addition to a 
library, cafeteria and multipurpose room. The blacktop and two 
baseball fields are shared with Parkmead Elementary School. Tice Creek has its own play structure. All classrooms have 
been renovated to meet the most modern standards of classroom space. There
 
are two full
-
time custodians assigned to 
maintaining the facility, and additional support is provided by the district office as needed.
 
 
Tice Creek has expanded in enrollment over the last few years. In its first year, enrollment was 300 as a K
-
6 school. 
Seventh 
grade was added in year two, bringing enrollment to 375. In 2019
-
20, enrollment as a K
-
8 school is 427 in the current

In order to meet the needs of 
increasing enrollment, new structures were needed for the school site. A local facilities bond 
Measure D passed in June 2016 and provided funding for the additional needed facility space. Six new STEAM classrooms 
for upper school opened in September of 201
8. The construction of a new multipurpose room was completed in August 
2019.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

All professional growth is determined by both school site and district strategic planning process, which is ongoing 
throughout the school year and culminates with an update in the spring of each year. 
Planning teams include all school 
and community stakeholders, and the work is based on site
-
needs assessments. Input from all school and community 
stakeholders is collected during the planning process and is used to develop the district Local Control and A
ccountability 
Plan (LCAP).
 
 
For 2019
-
20, the district focus will be on the implementation of the recently adopted math programs at both the K
-
5 and 
6
-

ext 
Generation Science Standards and the History/Social Science Framework. In addition to identifying the implementation of 
Common Core State Standards for professional growth in the district LCAP, other areas for professional development 
identified in the
 
district LCAP are: Technology Integration, English Language Development (ELD) instructional strategies 
and Silicon Valley Mathematics Initiative (SVMI) training.
 
 

l study. As each school 
identifies goals for supporting the district focus, staff members meet by grade level or departments to study student 
assessment data or student behaviors and determine how to improve instruction through research and effective 
pedag
ogy. Weekly collaboration time is provided for all TK
-
8 teachers. Instructional coaches provide individual student
-
centered coaching cycles and participate in grade
-
level and department meetings to support professional growth.
 
 
Individual teachers and admi
nistrators keep their skills current by researching about learning, attending workshops and 
classes and reading on their own. Some examples are attendance at various conferences: Teachers College Reading and 
Writing Project, ISTE, PBL World, SVMI, Middle S
chool Conference, Socratic Seminar, Reading Recovery, and technology. 
Teachers attend training sessions in differentiated instruction, special education, Next Generation Science Standards 
(NGSS) and in all core curricular areas. Beginning teachers particip
ate in a two
-
year induction program with a mentor who 
is trained through the Contra Costa County Office of Education Teacher Induction Program.
 
 
We continue to provide four days each school year that are dedicated to staff and professional development. The
 
district 
ensures the agendas for these professional growth days are tied to areas defined by the strategic plan and LCAP.
