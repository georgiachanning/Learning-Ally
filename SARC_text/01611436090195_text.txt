A
t Cragmont Elementary, we are dedicated to providing an outstanding education for all students 

d 
history of high standards and academic excellence. Our curriculum is aligned with the Common 
Core Standards, promoting 21st century skills. We are dedicated to providing an instructional 
program that motivates our students to become lifelong learners and
 
ethical citizens and leaders.
 
 
At Cragmont we believe that students will experience success when they come to school feeling 
valued, socially and culturally connected, and when teachers and staff have high expectations for 
their academic 
achievement. Our job is to develop creative, hands
-
on, and meaningful academic 
experiences to prepare our students to be lifelong learners. In conjunction with providing strong 
academics, we believe that school should educate the whole child. At Cragmont w
e offer a variety 
of enrichment programs, including art, music, dance, and gardening.
 
 
Cragmont Elementary has a vibrant and engaging school community that encourages family 
involvement. Parents/families are an important and very active part of our communi
ty. We invite 
parents/families to partner with our dedicated, hard working staff and take an active part in our 
school community.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Acc
ountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control
 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data repor
ted in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Williams legislation calls for the schools to have enough books in core classes for all students and asks districts to reveal
 
whether those books are 
presenting information outlined in the California content st
andards.  Textbook materials are adopted by the school board following a rotating adoption 
cycle for subject specific state adopted textbooks and instructional materials.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district administers have a scheduled maintenance program to ensure that all class
rooms and facilities are well maintained and in good repair. A 
work order process alerts district personnel of any maintenance needed to be performed and ensures that emergencies are given
 
the highest priority.
 
 
Safety issues are the top priority for Maint
enance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors inspect school sites continually and complete repairs 
in a timely manner. They use a work order process to ensure an efficient, prioritized repair process. The district maintenanc
e staff has indicated
 
that 
100% of all toilets on school grounds are in working order.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issu
ed by the Office of Public School Construction.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smar
ter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible
 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents/caregivers ar
e an important and very active part of our community.  They are welcomed and invited to participate in school events, and are
 
respected partners in their students' education.  Parents/caregivers assist teachers in the classroom, chaperone on field tri
ps, h
elp in the library, conduct 
tours for new to the district families, and work in the office. They also hold the role of room parent helping teachers and t
heir school by communicating 
and coordinating important event information to our families. Our extremel
y involved parents and caregivers run school events including the Carnival, 
Latinx heritage event, Winter arts event, Black history event, Silent Auction and Crafts & Food Fairs. Parents/caregivers als
o contribute as members of 
our PTA, School Site Council
 
(SSC), which is instrumental in writing our school site plan, and the English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), which 
advises the principal and school staff on issues related to English Learners. We have a parent participation rate for parent
-
teacher co
nferences of 
approximately 90 percent. Our Office of Family Engagement and Equity provides parent/caregiver support and interaction that c
ontribute to a wonderful 
partnership between home and school, benefiting the children at Cragmont Elementary.
 
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC
 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a
 
primary concern at Cragmont Elementary School. A variety of people visit the campus to volunteer in the classroom 
and participate in school events. During lunch, recesses, and before and
-
 
after school, staff members, administrators, and school campus aide
s supervise 
students and school grounds to ensure an orderly, safe environment. The school is always fully compliant with all rules, laws
, and regulations concerning 
state earthquake standards and hazardous materials. Earthquake and fire drills are held mo
nthly, and intruder drills are held at least once a year.
 
 
Safety procedures, including elements of our Comprehensive Safe School Plan, are reviewed with school and district staff at t
he start of each school year.  
The comprehensive school safety plan must
 
be updated annually by the school site council/school governance council or may be delegated by a school 
safety planning committee. The plan was last updated and reviewed with school staff in spring 2019.
