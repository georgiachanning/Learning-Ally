School Description
 
 
Principal's Message
 
At Lakeside Middle School, our mission is to develop productive and 
responsible students who can 
adapt to the challenges of an ever changing world. Lakeside Middle School has been a central part

field of education and as caring individuals who put students first.  Academic expectations are high 
at Lakeside, but constant support ensures that students can meet them with confidence. Studen

are not only prepared to excel at the middle school level, they also receive the tools they need to 
succeed in high school and beyond.  Lakeside embraces core values expressed in our PRIDE 
acronym; promoting Punctuality, Respect, Integrity, Determinatio
n, and Effort. Our focus on 
academic achievement and personal qualities is expressed in our college going culture. We are a 
certified, just recently honored with 2016, 2017, 2018 ,a nd 2019 Site of Distinction for our

Redesignation of School to Watch. The rigorous criteria for this award were the following:  High 
Academic Achie
vement, Developmental Responsiveness (to the needs of adolescent children), 
Social Equity and effective Structural Organization.   High student achievement results for all 
students, including subgroups, also determined our status as a 2015 Gold Ribbon Scho
ol, a 2015 
Title I Achieving School and as a 2018 Honor Roll School for California  Business for Education 
Excellence (CBEE).  This school year has indeed validated the relentless pursuit of excellence that is 
embodied in the culture of Lakeside Middle Sch

achievement, we provide opportunities for students to excel in areas of leadership and the 
performing arts.  These opportunities include our award winning AVID programs, ASB, Period One 
electives (Journalism, chorus,
 
Leadership, and STEM class.  Students can also participate in fun clubs 
such as, the PRIDE Club, Pokemon Club, Gaming Club and in 6th Session Enrichment classes that 
include, Yoga, Culinary Arts, Coding, and Zumba 
--
 
to name a few.  In addition, students 
can develop 
problem solving skills in collaborative groups by participating in a variety of school wide 
competitions such as, The Catapult Challenge, Building Bridges, Pasta Cars and Marshmallow 
Towers.  There are formal GATE activities that engage student
s in real world competitions and many 
other exciting opportunities for enrichment.  At Lakeside, we are especially proud of our band, from 
beginning to intermediate to advanced.  Under the guidance and expertise of Mr. Pike, our Band 
Director, our band per

1, the highest mark). Our Band and Chorus perform throughout the year, receiving many accolades 
in the process.  Stakeholder engagement does not mean "students", but also includes p
arents and 
guardians.   We offer many opportunities for involvement at Lakeside.  
These include opportunities 
for all parents such as, Back to School Night, parent
-
teacher conferences, Coffee with the Principal, 
Math and Science Night, and Open House.  We 
also offer volunteering opportunities during which 
parents can volunteer on site in events such as, International Day of Peace, Red Ribbon Week and 
the Great Kindness Challenge Week.  We also offer leadership opportunities for parents who would 
like to tak

for Student Achievement as a member of 
the School Site Council.  Parents of English Learners can participate as members of the English 
Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) and join the School Site Council (SSC).

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned I
mprovements (Most Recent Year)
 
Lakeside Middle School has 24 regular classrooms, 14 portable classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library, an administration b
uilding, a locker room, 
and a fitness center. The main campus was built in 1953. Additions were cons
tructed in 1997, 2000, 2002, and 2005. In 2008

2009, we updated the 
wiring to accommodate our rapidly increasing use of technology.
 
 
During the 2011
-
2012 school year we added new tables to our student eating area and new doors for selected classrooms. Duri
ng the 2012
-
2013 school 
year we completed upgrades of doors for all classrooms. Our technology infrastructure was greatly enhanced with a bandwidth e
xpansion from 5 
megabytes per second to 500 megabytes per second. This expansion has improved operation of 
all computers on campus. Our locker rooms were 
modernized 2013
-
2014.
 
 
Our custodians clean each classroom every other day and the restrooms every day. District maintenance picks up litter, remove
s graffiti, and maintains 
landscaping on a regular weekly sch
edule.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the
 
Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their str
uctural integrity, electrical systems, heating and ventilation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good
 
repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifie
s it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for this assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the si

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parent involvement is a cri
tical component to our students' achievement at Lakeside Middle School.  Parents have different opportunities to get involved
.  
As leaders, parents are invited to join our School Site Council (SSC), English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), and Parent 
Tea
cher Organization (PTO). 
The SSC develops, approves, monitors, and evaluates our 
School Plan
 
for Pupil Achievement and Safety Plan.  The SSC also reviews the LCAP budget and 
approves it for Board of Education approval.  Our ELAC advises the SSC and monitor
s the English Learner program and attendance. Parents are also 
invited to Coffee with the Principal every month, to review The Middle Years monthly publication which focuses on adolescent 
development and offers 
practical advice for families.  Families also
 
participate in Family Math and Science Night, Back to School Night in the Fall, Open House in the Spring, 
Parent/Teacher Conferences and several history and science competitions held throughout the year.  Our families enjoy student
 
performances such as 
ba
nd, chorus, sports, AVID, parent activities, and Battle of the Books.  As a means of communication, families  receive frequen
t phone calls regarding 
events, the monthly Parent Post and website postings.  Please visit our website for a listing of parent eve
nts each month.

School Safety Plan
 
Lakeside Middle School maintains safety as the number one priority for all students and staff.  We monitor students in and ou
t of the 
classroom and 
anytime that they are on campus.  Our Assistant Principal, teachers, and campus supervisors monitor the grounds for 15 minute
s before classes begin, 
during nutrition and lunch, and for 15 minutes after dismissal. The Assistant Principal maint
ains regular communication with law enforcement and 
community service providers to ensure the safety of our students within the community.
 
 
We revise our School Safety Plan annually. It includes procedures for emergencies, locations of exit routes, and inv
entories of emergency supplies and is 
available in the school office. We share the plan with all staff during a staff meeting and receive approval of it from our S
chool Site Council. We practice 
fire and earthquake drills three times a year and  train staf
f on emergency preparedness annually.
 
 
We maintain a closed campus for safety reasons. The gates are opened from 7:30
-
8:00 a.m. for entry to the school. Administrators and certificated staff 
supervise during this time. The gates are locked at 8:00 a.m. 
and all entry is through the front office. All visitors sign in and obtain a visitors pass to identify 
that they have authorization to be on campus. Only employees of Lakeside Middle School have access without this procedure. Co
nsistent adherence to 
this p
rocedure ensures the safety of our students.
 
 
Little Lake City School District and Lakeside Middle School consider the safety of students, staff, and the community our fir
st priority. Each month, we 
conduct emergency drills to ensure that all of our studen
ts and staff know exactly what to do in case of an emergency. Fire drills, duck and cover drills, 
and  emergency lock down drills are rehearsed to ensure the safety of the Lakeside community. Twice each year, district
-
wide disaster drills are conducted 
tha
t include emergency scenarios such as, toxic gasses, intruder on campus and  earthquakes. School and district administration 
are confident that our 
students and staff will know how to respond in emergency situations.  Our parent survey reflected that 100% 
of parents feel that Lakeside provides a 
safe environment for students. Our entire staff has also participated in " No Bully" training and provides ongoing support fo
r all students involved with 
bullying circumstances.  This constant vigilance over all saf
ety issues ensures that students and staff can concentrate on instruction. During the 2018
-
19 
school year we trained in our fourth year of Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) for implementation.  With 
this preventive, positive and 
proacti
ve approach, we not only establish a safe atmosphere but a welcoming, friendly environment for our students and their familie
s..

Lakeside Middle 
School staff make every effort to develop their skills and expertise systematically throughout the school year and during the
 
summer.  
The 2018*19school year was full of exciting opportunities for professional development!   Teachers at all grade levels an
d content areas continued to 
develop their understanding of the new California State Standards by developing units of instruction, assessments and rubrics
 
collaboratively. History 
teachers attended LACOE training on the the new History frameworks.  A team 
of teachers also continued to train in Positive Behavior intervention 
Support (PBIS) in order to implement it at a high level of fidelity at Lakeside. In addition, during 2018
-
19 all teachers participated in three district wide 
professional development day
s focused on Math (UCLA training/Math TOSA's) , NGSS (UCLA Project) for science teachers, andThinking Maps (ELA, 
History).  Science and Math teachers attended Thinking Maps training during Saturdays and the summer and began to implement t
hem during the 201
8
-
19school year.    PE teachers worked together to design lessons to help prepare students for the Physical Fitness Test, while
 
our Band Director worked 
with his counterparts at Lake Center to coordinate performances  Student free days were also designated
 
to work in content area teams to develop 
instructional units, create assessments, and visit  programs at other sites.  To provide ongoing professional development for
 
all teachers, coaches were 
hired  to work with math and science teachers. Teachers were 
then able to have the coaches observe their lessons and provide feedback on these lessons.   
At Lakeside we also engage in Professional Learning Communities called Data Reflection Sessionss (DRS), during which student 
data is analyzed and 
strategies are di
scussed to support all of our students.  This takes place 6 times a year with every grade level and every core content area. 
 
LCAP 7 funds 
conferences, teacher release time to plan units of instruction, and teacher release time for DRS.  We also have a Stu
dent Achievement Leadership that 
works together to move our school forward in the area of student academic achievement by planning professional development fo
r our teachers during 
early release Wednesdays and during DRS.

Types of Services Funded
 
The Little Lake City School District provides additional services for students using federal funds (Title I, Title III, Title
 
IV) and LCAP funds.  Title I funds are 
primarily used to support all students using a Response to Intervention (RtI) model.  At the elementary sites, Interventionis
ts are funded to provide 
differentiated instruction to meet the needs of all learners within the RtI model in ELA and mathematics d
uring the school day.  At the middle schools, 
Interventionists monitor student academic progress and determine placement for intervention based on student needs.  Title I 
funds are also used to 
support parent involvement at both the site and district level
.  Title III is used to provide supplemental services to all English Learners including additional 
tutoring beyond the school day, and professional development for EL Coordinators.  Title IV funds provide students with a wel
l
-
rounded education and 
supports
 
using phenomena in NGSS
-
designed lessons through the creation of NGSS kits.  In addition, these funds support safe and healthy students 
through the implementation of a social emotional learning program, Second Step, which is a proactive approach to buildi
ng essential social and behavioral 
skills.  LCAP Funds are used to supplement services for English learners, low income students, and homeless/foster students. 
 
Some actions and services 
include additional counselors, professional development for teachers,
 
supplemental materials, parent engagement opportunities, and student 
motivation activities.
