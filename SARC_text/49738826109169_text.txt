By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most 
Recent Year)
 
 
Monte Vista opened after initial construction was completed in 1990. In 1993, the MU/kitchen, Library/Admin, 
Kindergarten, and additional classrooms were added as permanent buildings. During the summer of 1997, six additional 
portable classr
ooms were added to accommodate the increased number of classes, which resulted from lowering class 
size in grades K
-
3. In addition, a YMCA program is housed in a double
-
wide portable building on site. The school contains 
23 classrooms, a multi
-
use room, st
aff room, office and workroom, seminar room, library, computer lab, updated play 
structures and storage. Monte Vista buildings now comprise over 51,200 square feet on more than 8.75 acres.
 
 

-
term preservation is part of the Districts five
 
year Deferred Maintenance Plan as mandated by the 
state. As a participant in the plan, the campus was painted in the summer of 2005.  Carpets in classrooms and school 
buildings is replaced as needed.  In 2007, Deferred Maintenance funds were used to repla
ce flooring in 13 classrooms and 
2 bathrooms, along with new bathroom partitions and concrete sidewalk repairs. It is currently maintained on a daily basis 
by the onsite custodial staff, supplemented by the District Maintenance and Operations Dept. Handica
p accessibility needs 
and improvements are continually reviewed. Because the campus was built after October 12, 1988, construction practices 
prohibited ACBM.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State prior
ity: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alt
ernate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements 
for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Professional Development in the Cotati
-
Rohnert Park Unified School Districts targets research
-
proven best practices. In 
addition to the days of training provided outside of the 
student instructional year, teachers have numerous opportunities 
to develop as professionals through district
-
sponsored trainings offered through release time and on regularly scheduled 
professional development dates. The elementary schools have two aftern
oons per month for professional development. 
The district has transitioned to the Common Core State Standards; therefore, many professional development days 
support this transition. During 2018
-
2019, Monte Vista has undertaken the ongoing process of provid
ing professional 
development to teachers based in improving student academic achievement and using data to inform instruction. The 
district has provided ongoing professional development in math, Poweschool training, and PBIS. The district also hosts 
monthl

intervention and learning center programs. Professional coaching in implementation of effective reading instruction is 
provided to every e
lementary school teacher.
