By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and communit
y members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and 
other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation
, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Bridge Street School Mission Statement:  At Bridge Street School, we encourage our students to be problem solvers by 
teaching them skills to be safe, responsible and respectful.
 
 
Bridge Street Elementary School puts forth its 
personal best to foster educational growth and community relationships. 
Home of the Bulldogs, Bridge Street sits on approximately six acres in the center of Yuba City and serves approximately 
530 students in Junior Kindergarten through grade five. A State 
preschool also resides on our campus.  Each grade level 
consists of three to four teachers, allowing for the development of relationships to be formed with all of the students 
throughout the grade level. We believe in promoting and encouraging a well
-
round
ed student body through academics, 
attendance, character, and health/fitness. Students in grade five attend an outdoor camp, Shady Creek, where they 
participate in hands
-
on science and environmental activities.   Fifth graders also participate in the YCUSD
 
district
-
wide 
track and field meet held annually at Geweke Field.  Music is provided for students in first through third grades, and band 
and strings are offered to students in grades fourth and fifth grades. Our Student Council officers and representativ
es are 
elected in the fall of each year and host a range of activities including leadership, school pride, anti
-
drug campaigns, 
recycling projects/energy conservation, and community outreach service projects.  At Bridge Street School, we accentuate 
the pos
itive in all students for their outstanding work in attendance, character attributes, academic gains, and most 
notably, their individual progress made through the year.
 
 
Bridge Street School staff strives for high performance, coupled with high expectation
s.  Teachers and staff participate in 
professional development for curriculum and instruction focused on the Common Core Standards.  Each classroom is 
equipped with a Smartboard, a mobile lab, an LCD projector for curriculum delivery and a document camera.
 
Teachers are 
trained in the most current, adopted district curriculum and technology, in order to equip students with what they will 
need to be successful citizens in the 21st century.  To focus on the essential learning in lessons, daily objectives are p
osted 
in Reading Language Arts and Math. Our library holds over five thousand Accelerated Reader fiction and non
-
fiction books.  
Accelerated Reader is a motivational and engaging reading program for students that allows them to take a test and earn 
points 
after reading each book. Our library, equipped with a computer lab, is open every morning before school to provide 
time for students to work on iRead, a phonemically based intervention program, Type to Learn, and/or Accelerated 
Reader.  We have a counselor
 
and social worker on campus who both support the social/emotional needs of our students 
with the implementation of mindfulness and trauma based practices.  Our counselor provides a foundation for positive 
social growth for all students as well.  Bridge St
. also has the support of a librarian, health aide, psychologist, two 
instructional coaches, parent liaison, and physical education specialist.  We offer after
-
school intervention classes to 
support students who need additional supports in mastering the gr
ade level standards.
 
 
Our Beyond the Bell/After School Program, provided through an After School Education and Safety grant,  runs daily to 
6:00 p.m. and provides opportunities for approximately 120 students in the areas of academic intervention, enrichmen
t, 
and recreation.  Special events such as a tennis tournament, the annual talent show, and Girl Scouts are provided through 
our After School Program.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Bridge Street School is located on nearly six acres in the center of Yuba City. The main building houses the office and the 
capacity for eighteen classrooms. There are nine classroom
 
portables, one multi
-
purpose room, a parent liaison portable, 
and a State Preschool. The school also has benefited from: access compliance improvements to all classrooms, drinking 
fountains, walkways, and bathroom stalls, the installation of an alarm syst
em and exhaust fans, and HVAC replacement in 
the main building.  Skylights provide an additional natural light source for classrooms in the main building.  Energy cost
-
saving measures are in place during the evening, weekend, and on non
-
school days.
 
 
The multi
-
purpose room was built and became operational at the beginning of the 2008
-
2009 school year. The multi
-
purpose room provides facilities for breakfast and lunch, school assemblies, Physical Education classes, evening programs, 
and community use. W
alls were erected to form classrooms in the main building during summer of 2010. New carpet was 
installed and additional surveillance cameras were established throughout the campus.

Our Parent Liaison coordinates parent activities ranging from classroom support to school involvement with field trips and 
parent classes.  Parents, not only provide support in the classroom
 
and to the school site, but also with special activities 
like shelving books in the school library, chaperoning field trips, assisting with health screenings, and serving on our Scho
ol 
Site Council and English Language Advisory Council (ELAC). A represent
ative from our ELAC serves on the Yuba City Unified 
District English Language Advisory Council (DELAC).  Our school's Social Worker also provides community resources and 
additional parent engagement opportunities for our families.  Numerous programs and ac
tivities are enriched by the 
generous contributions made by the following community organizations:
 
 
Yuba City Rotary Club
 
River Valley High School Key Club
 
Kiwanis Club

We are also fortunate to be in our third year with our Parent Teacher Organization (PTO).  Our PTO brings many great 
activities to involve and build positive relationships with our students and families.  They 
hold movie nights, dinners at 
school events, a Santa breakfast, a Fall Festival, an Eggstravaganza and other fundraising events to support our school.  
They hold monthly meetings on the 3rd Friday of every month.  This is a great way to positively engage w
ith our school 
and families.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Bridge Street campus is 
currently comprised of 26 classrooms, a library/media center, the main office, multi
-
purpose 
room with kitchen, a Learning Center, a Health Clinic, Speech and Language room, Parent Resource room, and a State 
Preschool. Safety of students and staff is a pri
mary concern of Bridge Street Elementary School. The School Site Safety 
plan is updated annually by the School Site Council and the Safe School Committee, which consists of teachers, parents, a 
custodian, the secretary, and principal. The Safety Plan stres
ses the procedures for ensuring student safety during 
emergencies. Revisions to the Safety Plan are reviewed with the entire staff as they take place. Procedural revisions are 
also reviewed with the student body. The school is in compliance with all laws, 
rules, and regulations pertaining to 
hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The school's disaster preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring 
student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire, earthquake, and lock
-
down drills are conducted on
 
a regular basis 
throughout the school year. Two off
-
site evacuation sites are designated in the event of an emergency requiring relocation 
of students.  The school is working alongside the district with the Incident Command System to build a uniformed pro
cess 
of all personnel in the event of disaster.
 
 
Bridge Street Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. Students are 
supervised by teachers and administrators before and after school. During lunch and recess
, yard duty personnel and 
administrators supervise students. Crossing guards are on duty at main intersection areas before and after school. There 
is a designated and supervised student drop
-
off and pickup area at the main entrance of the school. All visit
ors must sign 
in at the clerk's office, where they receive a badge that must be displayed at all times. Visitors are encouraged to give 
teachers prior notification so as to not interrupt instruction when visiting a classroom.
 
 
Bridge Street School Emergenc
y Procedures and Safety Plan was reviewed and updated in August 2019.
