Like the roaring '20s, our district is poised to make some noise in 2020!
 
LEUSD student accountability showed meaningful gains with the latest California School Dashboard 
results. Positive growth in 

focus on Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) to provide teachers and principals with critical 
performance data to guide daily instruction, helping students succeed!
 
 

 
first new school in 12 years is greatly anticipated. Alberhill Elementary School will 
open in August of 2020. This new TK
-
5 school will feature state
-
of
-
the
-
art solar energy efficiency, 
flexible classroom furniture and configurable classroom space, exciti
ng classroom technology, and 
advanced campus security systems.
 
 
Recent facilities projects funded by the recent Measure V school bond include flexible classroom 
furniture, artificial turf replacement, playground refurbishment, LED lighting conversions, and
 
classroom technology purchases. Grant funded CTE program expansion will significantly update our 
existing engineering, agriculture, and medical career pathways. All LEUSD high school performing 
arts centers have recently received state
-
of
-
the
-
art sound an
d lighting upgrades, and new theater 
seating plus stage refurbishments are coming next.
 
 
A previously shuttered campus in Wildomar, Jean Hayman Elementary, was reopened this summer 
under a new development plan that will unfold over the next five years. Pha
se 1 tenant 
improvements were recently completed to accommodate the Southern California EMS Training 
Institute. Phase 2 will include refurbishment of the existing multipurpose room for professional 
development, staff training, community meeting rooms, and 
expanded parking. Phases 3 and 4 
include the relocation of existing adult education programs, new site
-
based child care, plus 
separate parking. Phase 5 will complete the relocation of our existing Adult Transition Program; 
also, installation of affordable 
housing for teachers as an incentivized recruitment strategy, 
enabling LEUSD to stay competitive in a statewide teacher shortage.
 
 
As you can see, 2020 and the beginning of a new decade has plenty for everyone to shout about!
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Dr. Doug Kimberly,
 
Superintendent

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional in
formation about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Lake Elsinore Unified School District (LEUSD) is committed to 
maintaining a safe, secure, and aesthetically pleasing environment for our students. 
The LEUSD Governing Board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the District. A summary of these standards is
 
available at the school office and at the Distric
t Office. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean 
and safe school. In addition to District
-
level support of routine and periodic maintenance needs, LEUSD holds high standards for cleanliness, appea
rance, 
and good repair of all campuses daily and maintains them through the efforts of the students, staff, day custodian, evening c
ustodial crew, and District 
Maintenance Department. Our maintenance staff ensures the repairs necessary to keep the school i
n good repair and working order are completed in a 
timely manner.
 
 
A work
-
order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. LEUSD regularly 
assesses maintenance, 
modernization, and new construction
 
needs. Any pesticide use at our school sites is in compliance with the Healthy Schools Act of 2000.
 
 
Fire drill evacuations are conducted on a monthly basis at all elementary and middle schools, and twice a year at the high sc
hools in the District. A fire
 
safety inspection is conducted once each year by the Riverside County Fire Department, while site personnel conduct site insp
ections on a regular basis.
 
 

imes per year at each elementary school and middle 
school, and once each semester at the high schools.
 
 
Currently, the District provides storage areas for emergency supplies to be kept on campus in the event of a disaster. A radi
o communication system 
allo
ws for continuous communication with the District office in the event of a disaster.
 
 
A Crisis Intervention Team has been identified and trained to deal with stress experienced by students and staff as a result 
of a crisis situation. Team 
members are calle
d upon to assist across the District as necessary. As part of the comprehensive School Safety Program, School Resource Office
rs provide 
prevention and intervention procedures on all LEUSD campuses at least part time.
 
 
Our school was built in 1989. It has 2
6 regular classrooms, six science labs, eight portables, a library, a computer lab, a multipurpose room, and five 
special education rooms. The designed capacity of the school is 1,300 students. Athletic facilities include a gym, dance room
, and outside cou
rts and 
fields.
 
 
A progressive discipline plan is in place and multiple discipline and Expectations assemblies are conducted throughout the ye
ar. Four campus supervisors 
and a part
-
time School Resource Officer also help maintain a safe environment. The WE 
TIP program is utilized so that students may report crime 
anonymously and all leads are followed up immediately.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the Californi
a Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate ac
hievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
