Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent 
Year)
 
 
Whitley provides a safe and clean environment for learning. A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the 
District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are maintained to a degree of adequacy that provides for good 
learning. 

Coordinator of Safety and Risk Management verifies quarterly that OSHA requirements are met. The exterior grounds are 
well lit and
 
the perimeter of the school facility is fenced for student protection and safety. A team of custodians ensures 
classrooms and campus grounds are kept clean and safe. The restrooms are cleaned, sanitized and secured at the end of 
each school day with 100% 
of the toilets in operating condition. As outlined in our Safe Schools Plan, the safety committee 
has addressed concerns for the safe coming and going of our students. The committee feels that security of all students is 
of the highest priority. Staff rece
ives inservice in emergency protocol and CPR. All district employees, including substitutes, 
must wear identification badges while on our site or any district site. Visitor badges are issued to parents entering our 
campus, volunteers, and other visitors as
 
they register in our office. The gates on the perimeter of the school playground 
are locked during school hours and staff members are trained to activate lock down procedures in the event of an 
emergency. Our positive partnership with local law enforcemen
t is evident in their quick response time when concerns 
arise. Designated staff members carefully supervise students on the playground and in the cafeteria. Grounds and 
playground equipment are inspected regularly for potential hazards. The District provid
es on
-
going training in CPR/First 
Aid as part of its staff development program. Fire and/or disaster drills occur monthly and a complete school site disaster 
plan has been prepared and is in place and available for public review. Scheduled certificated sup
ervision of students 
begins officially thirty minutes prior to the start of school (7:50) and ten minutes after the end of school (3:20).

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
o
f study.

The Whitley Safe School Plan covers several important areas to ensure the climate and culture at Whitley Elementary 
School supports students in the classroom and outside of the classroom.  To address cultural diversity t
he school will 
provide English Language Development, conduct meetings to provide information on English Language Development and 
hold training.  To ensure staff meets student and family needs we will provide training on a variety of safety areas.  The 
scho
ol's physical environment has signage, employee badges and parent sign in for student safety.  For emergency 
preparedness we will have training, equipment and practice disaster scenarios.  Whitley will promote a collaborative and 
positive culture to suppor
