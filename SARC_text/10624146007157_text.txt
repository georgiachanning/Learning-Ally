By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-

John Wash Instructional Vision:
 
Our students will learn and persevere to be college/career ready in a safe, collaborative and engaging environment.
 
 
For more than 50 years, John Wash Elementary has held strong to the traditions of community and family.On Friday's as 
the school day begins 700 students, 27 teachers, 1 Curriculum Support Provider, 2 RSP teachers, RSP aide, 1 principal.  
John Wash Elementa
ry (JWE) is located in a semi
-
rural area, situated five miles southeast of Fresno on the western 
boundary of Sanger Unified School District. The eastern and southern areas of John Wash Elementary are rich in 
agriculture, while the northern and western area
s are growing suburban areas. The school was opened in 1962 and serves 
children in grades preschool through sixth. JWE student demographics are 16% Asian, 32% Hispanic,12% White, 2% 
African
-
American, 14% two or more races and .29% American Indian or Alaska
 
Native. English Language Learners make up 
15% of our school population.  The top four languages spoken at our school are English, Spanish, Hmong, and Punjabi.  
Socially Disadvantage population is 59% and Students with Disabilities is 6%.
 
 
JWE's academic e
xcellence continues to be a top priority. Our CAASSP scores in ELA and Math have been the following:  In 
2016/17 ELA was 49% met or exceeded and Math was 45% met or exceeded. In 2017/18 ELA was 56% met or exceeded 
and Math was 51% met or exceeded. ELA incr
eased by 7% and Math increased by 6%. Last year for the 18/19 school year 
our ELA CAASPP was 61% met or exceeded. This was an increase of +5. JWE math CAASPP was 60% met or exceeded which 
was an increase of +9.
 
 
JWE has established a system of mutual accou
ntability of standards based learning and common instructional practices. 
JWE system has three components, 1) Professional Learning Communities, 2) Pyramid of Interventions, and 3) Direct 
Instruction, that work together to ensure student success. Professio
nal Learning Communities provide teachers the 
opportunity to collaborate and establish SMART goals. JWE Pyramid of Intervention monitors student learning. Direct 
Instruction establishes strategies to teach the standards with this year's emphasis on Core EL
A instruction, academic 
vocabulary, academic discourse, and reteach/enrichment opportunities at the end of units.
 
 
JWE comprehensive programs are designed to educate and develop the "whole child." Staff, students and community 
members exhibit the five 
core values of "Community of Caring," character education program, The five values, family, 
trust, respect, caring, and responsibility are displayed in every classroom. In 2012 we instituted a Positive Behavior 
Intervention System using the acronym R.O.A.R
.S. This stands for Responsibility, OnTask, Achievement, Respect and Self 
Control. These behaviors are seen on our entire campus and students are rewarded with R.O.A.R.S tickets.  Learning 
Enrichment Activity Program (LEAP) is an after
-
school program that 
is an extension of the school day providing students 
with homework assistance, enrichment, art, and PE. Students in 4th, 5th, and 6th grade participate in the district music 
program with a credentialed music teacher. The PTA has many active leadership posi
tions and last year parents 
volunteered over 4,000 hours to JWE. This amount of participation reinforces the commitment of all JWE stakeholders to 
providing students with a well
-
rounded education.

and a family atmosphere. As staff, students, and parents walk 
through the campus they are met with motivational banners, the first summarizes our mission, "Every child, everyday, 
whatever it takes!" JWE looks forward to maintaining the traditions of high 
expectations and positive attitudes. With 
academic goals and a character value of the month, students at all levels are challenged with high expectations to reach 
their fullest potential. As a result, we are a four

N/A
 
School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Sanger Unified retains an independent contractor to provide comprehensive facilities inspection of every schoo
l site. This 
inspection meets or exceeds the criteria of the State of California Williams inspection requirement. The Williams 
compliance inspections are done by Fresno County Office of Education (FCOE). Only one SUSD site is inspected by Fresno 
County Off
ice of Education annually for Williams compliance. This site is not a FCOE inspected site. The most recent 
inspection, either district or Williams, available when this SARC is prepared is utilized for this report. Inspection reports
 
are maintained at the S
USD District Office.
 
 
The rating scale used for this inspection is as follows:
 
 
99% 
-
 
100% = Exemplary: School meets most/all standards of good repair. Noted deficiencies, if any, are not significant.
 
 
90% 
-
 
98.99% = Good: School maintained in good 
repair with some isolated deficiencies from wear/tear or are being 
mitigated.
 
 
75% 
-
 
89.99% = Fair: School is not in good repair with some critical or widespread deficiencies and repairs are necessary.
 
 
00% 
-
 
74.99% = Poor: School facilities are in poor co
ndition with deficiencies of various degrees throughout and major 
repairs are necessary.
 
 
The results of the most recent report available for this campus are disaggregated below.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students t
ested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of student
s tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calc
ulated using only students who received 
scores.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
John Wash school site has a Safe School Plan that is reviewed and updated annually with all stakeholders!   Plans are 
reviewed with staff annually often at the beginning of each School Year.   John Wash's School Site Council (SSC) approves 
our Safe School 
Plan.  Emergency drills are conducted monthly to prepare students and staff in the event of an emergency.  
We strive to maintain a safe, healthful, nurturing and orderly school campus that encourages positive attitudes in students 
and staff.  A joint effor
t between students and staff help keep the campus clean and litter free.  Site maintenance staff 
surveys the campus as the first order of business each day.  They insure the campus is clean, any vandalism is corrected, 
and that the campus is presentable an
d representative of the priority Sanger School Board sets on safety and appearance.  
Oversight of Sanger Unified Safe School Plans is through the Welfare and Attendance Office.  The Safe School Plan was 
reviewed with staff on August, 2019 and with SSC in N
ovember 2019.

What are the primary/major areas of focus for staff development and specifically how were they selected? For example, 
were student achievement data used to determine the need for professional development in reading instruction?
 
 
All of our professional dev
elopment is based on the needs of our students and teachers, assessed through observations, 
surveys, disaggregation of SBAC data, PBIS data and other assessment data. Teachers in Sanger Unified have completed 
professional training courses designed to suppo
rt educational priorities and objectives. Staff Development Days are 
designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for administrators, teachers and classified personnel.
 
 
What are the methods by which professional development is delivered (e.g., af
ter school workshops, conference 
attendance, individual mentoring, etc.)?
 
 
As a district, we are committed to offering teachers a variety of professional learning opportunities and options for 
personalized professional development. Sanger Unified provides 
professional learning in all subjects (Math, STEAM, ELA, 
ELD, assessments etc.) for TK
-
6th grade teachers throughout the school year. For single
-
subject teachers, Sanger Unified 
provides two to four full days of training dedicated to specific initiatives, 
strategies and frameworks (Balanced Literacy, 
Guaranteed and Viable Instruction, ELD, Writing, Speaking and Listening, Close Reading, Project Based Learning, Universal 
Design for Learning, etc.) Sanger Unified also offers after
-
school workshops on various 
math instructional strategies and 
routines, after
-
school technology trainings and Universal Design for Learning trainings. Each year, we offer a district 
conference where teachers share their best practices with one another. Teacher leaders at all sites ar
e given a variety of 
opportunities to attend national and state conferences and seminars, as to further the collective knowledge of all 
members of their grade level teams and learning communities. Teachers also have the opportunity to engage in 
personalize
d professional development through instructional coaching.
 
 
New to the profession Teachers are also supported through the Sanger Unified School District Beginning Teacher Support 
and Assessment Induction Program (BTSA) and New Teacher Support. A teacher th
at is teaching under a PIP or STSP, or is 
an Intern is assigned a mentor that provides the new teacher with a minimum of 4 hours per week of direct or indirect 
support for his/her individualized professional growth. In addition, the teachers attend require
d professional development 
provided by the district and school site. New teachers that have a preliminary credential participate in our formal BTSA 
Induction Program. Teachers participating in BTSA receive support from a trained support provider for two ye
ars. The

teachers, alon
g with their mentors (support providers) attend 4 Network meetings together over the 2 years. In addition, 
the program may offer additional professional development offerings based on participant request and through surveys 
that include the following: Clas
sroom Management, Conducting Parent Teacher Conferences/Parent communication, 
Meeting the needs of special needs students, Technology, Writing, etc. Sanger Unified's BTSA Induction Program provides 
support and assessment opportunities for all first and sec
ond year Participating Teachers to increase understanding of 
their own professional development, which will enable them to more effectively meet the diverse learning needs of their 
students. The mentors, called support providers, are trained in cognitive c
oaching, working with adult learners, and FACT. 
Support Providers attend a two
-
day training their first year and a one day Refresher every year after. In addition SPs are 
required to attend an orientation, and 2 after school trainings each year to work on 
their mentoring skills.

How are teachers supported during implementation (e.g., through in
-
class coaching, teacher
-
principal meetings, student 
performance data reporting, etc.)? With so many district initiatives, it is essential to have support for 
all teachers and 
administrators during implementation. Through many of our contracted trainings (Balanced Literacy, NGSS, UDL), our 
expert trainers provide on
-
site support and follow up personalized coaching. There are varied levels of support, both at 
the
 
site and district level. At school sites, teachers are supported during implementation by their grade
-
level or content 
colleagues through Professional Learning Communities. In addition, Curriculum Support Providers, Literacy Specialist 
Teachers, (Teachers
 
on Special Assignment) and administrators provide on site support. District support is provided at the 
PLC level through collaborative unit/lesson planning and facilitated curriculum curating experiences.
 
 
All of our professional development is based on 
our students and teachers needs. Teachers in Sanger Unified have 
completed professional training courses designed to support educational priorities and objectives. Staff Development 
Days are designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for adminis
trators, teachers and classified personnel.
 
 
Sanger Unified uses Staff Development Days and support from site level Curriculum Support Providers and district level 
District Instructional Specialists to assist teachers in classroom instructional strategies.
 
The district provided a strong base 
for Common Core English Language Arts Implementation over the last few years through professional development 
focused on academic vocabulary, content reading and writing, and unpacking standards. This year the district 
will provide 
an extensive Math training on the mathematical practices, math tasks, and academic discourse. Further English Language 
Arts professional development will focus on writing mini lessons and units.
 
 
New to the profession Teachers are also support
ed through the Sanger Unified School District Beginning Teacher Support 
and Assessment Induction Program (BTSA). Teachers participating in BTSA receive support from a trained support provider 
for two years. The Sanger BTSA program uses the Formative Assess
ment for California Teachers (FACT) formative 
assessment to guide "new" teachers in their professional growth. The Sanger BTSA program also provides a menu of 
professional development opportunities for BTSA Participating Teachers, Support Providers, and in
vites all teachers in the 
district to participate, if the topic meets their need. The menu of professional development offerings include the following:
 
Classroom Management, Conducting Parent Teacher Conferences/Parent communication, Meeting the needs of s
pecial 
needs students, Technology, UDL, Writing, etc. Sanger Unified's BTSA Induction Program provides support and assessment 
opportunities for all first and second year Participating Teachers to increase understanding of their own professional 
development
, which will enable them to more effectively meet the diverse learning needs of their students.
 
 
In addition to staff development days, teachers participate in workshops and conferences on the following: Literacy 
Strategies, Writing, Reading and Literacy T
raining, and ongoing SBE textbook adoption in
-
services are provided throughout 
the first 2
-
years of a curriculum, text implementation period. In
-
services in Effective Instructional Strategies, Professional 
Learning Communities, and strategies for English L
earners are also provided.
