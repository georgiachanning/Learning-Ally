School Description
 
 
Principal's Message
 
I'd like to welcome you to Hearst's Annual School Accountability Report Card, which provides 
valuable information about our school's instructional programs, academic achievement, classroom 
materials, school safety, f
acilities and staff. It is a privilege and honor to be the principal and 
educational leader of our Monarch Community and 2018 California Distinguished School. Our 
namesake, Phoebe Apperson Hearst, was a staunch supporter of education, service to community,
 
and early kindergarten movement, and co
-
founded the Parent Teacher Association (PTA). When 
you step foot onto our campus you will immediately feel the warmth and our strong commitment 
towards children.
 
 
Hearst's staff of just over 60 worked to meet the ne
eds of our 712 TK
-
5 students last year. Through 
ongoing collaboration, our teachers have developed a program that exemplifies high academic 
standards, character education with the integration of technology. During the 2012
-
13 school year, 
we began preparin
g for Common Core State Standards which were fully implemented in the 2014
-
15 school year. Our experienced staff meets student needs through data analysis, individualized 
and differentiated instruction. Our school
-
wide rules of Showing Respect, Solving Pro
blems and 
Making Good Decisions promote personal responsibility. Each month we focus on one of the 
District's Community of Character Traits: Responsibility, Compassion, Self
-
Discipline, Honesty, 
Respect and Integrity.
 
 
Our parent and community involvement 
is essential to our success. Through ongoing 
communication and teamwork, we are confident that Hearst students will continue to succeed. We 
are excited about our school accomplishments and welcome all to join in our efforts to create 
successful, responsibl
e citizens.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
Our school is dedicated to the development of the whole child, providing a solid foundation that 
stimulates thought, wonder, and a lifelong passion for learning. Students, staff, parents, and the 
Pleasanton community share th
e responsibility of creating a positive environment that empowers 
all students to reach their fullest potential in all core academic areas as well as character 
development.
 
 
Our Goals...
 

 
Measurable and ongoing increases in student academic achievement
 

 
A sa
fe school climate that emphasizes mutual respect
 

 
Ongoing partnerships with parents and the community

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

Instructional Materials
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Hearst Elem
entary School are currently being aligned to the California State Standards.  Instructional materials 
are selected from the state's most recent list of standards
-
based materials and adopted by the State Board of Education.  The district follows the State 
B
oard of Education's six
-
year adoption cycle for core content materials(English/language arts, math, science, and social science).
 
 
On Tuesday, September 24, 2019, the Pleasanton Unified School District's Board of Trustees held a public hearing to certify t
he extent to which textbooks 
and instructional materials have been provided to students.  The Board of Trustees adopted Resolution 2019
-
2020.004 which certifies as required by 
Education Code §60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional materials were provid
ed to all students, including English learners, in the district to the extent 
that each pupil has a textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient text
books and instructional materials 
were provided to ea
ch student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with the cycles and
 
content 
of the curriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English/language arts.
 
 
In addition to core 
subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materials used for their vi
sual/performing 
arts curricula. During the 2019
-
20 school year, Pleasanton Unified School District provided each student, including
 
English learners, enrolled in a 
visual/performing arts class with a textbook or instructional materials to use in class and to take home.  These materials co
mplied with the state's content 
standards and curriculum frameworks.

School Facilities & Maintenance
 
 
The district takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional through proper facilities maintena
nce and campus supervision. 
Hearst Elementary School's original f
acilities were built in 2000; ongoing maintenance and campus improvements ensure facilities remain up to date and 
provide adequate space for students and staff. District maintenance and site custodial staff ensure that the repairs necessar
y to keep the sch
ool in good 
condition are completed in a timely manner. A work order process issued by school and district staff to communicate non
-
routine maintenance requests. 
Every morning before school begins, the custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards or ot
her conditions that need attention prior to students and staff 
entering school grounds. One day custodian and two evening custodians (one full

time) are assigned to Hearst Elementary School. The

r Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible s
tudents 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
