About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instruct
ional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
A District committee considers textbooks for recommendation on a cycle established by the State Board of Education and from a
 
State adopted list.  The 
committee meets to discuss current issues relevant to the subject m
atter, including student success, previously used textbooks, and instructional 
methods.  The committee reviews demonstration copies of proposed textbooks, as well as listen to representatives describe the
 
various highlights of the 
available materials.  The
 
review is followed by a pilot of materials that results in consensus by the committee of a recommended textbook.  The textboo
k 
is forwarded to a K
-
12 Curriculum Council, which consists of teachers, parents, and community stakeholders, for review and appro
val.  If the textbook is 
approved by the K
-
12 Curriculum Council, the textbook is forwarded to the Superintendent and the Governing Board for their review and approval.
  
Each 
pupil in the district, including English learners, kindergarten through grade twe
lve, is provided with standards
-
aligned textbooks or basic instructional 
materials that are consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framework adopted by the State Board.
 
 
AB 1246, added Education Code Section 60210, which allows the distri
ct to use any instructional materials, not just state
-
adopted, as long as they are 
aligned with the academic content standards.  The EC 60119 has a new section (e) with a reference to the Common Core State St
andards (CCSS).  The 

urpose of transitioning to instructional materials that are aligned with the common core academic content standards, it is th
e 
intent of the Legislature that textbooks, instructional materials, and supplemental instructional materials be deemed to be a
lign
ed with the content 
standards pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (c), and be deemed consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framew
ork adopted by the state 
board pursuant to subdivision (a) if the textbooks, instructional materials, supplemen
tal instructional materials, or a combination of any such materials 

ed to either the 1997 
standards or the 2010 CCSS standards for 
mathematics and English Language Arts are compliant with Williams Act requirements.  In accordance with 
Education Code Section 60422(a) and 60119, the Governing Board certified on 9/3/2019 that each pupil in the district, includi
ng English learners, in 
kin
dergarten through grade twelve, has been provided with standards
-
aligned textbooks or basic instructional materials in each of the areas listed below:

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessme
nts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards,
 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the 
University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Harmony Elementary School values and welcomes volunteers on
 
our campus. In accordance with Hemet Unified School District policy, volunteers have 
a current TB test and have their fingerprints on file with the district. The Volunteer Application Form may be obtained from 
our school office. Limited 
funds are availabl

that we 
encourage our fathers to participate in.  Dads have the chance to spend the day at our school volunteering and acting as a 
positive male role model for 
our students.
 
 
Harmony Leadership Team and Teachers have planned monthly Family Evenings throughout the year. A schedule of events appears i
