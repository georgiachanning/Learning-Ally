By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Ma
intaining the appearance, safety and functionality of VPE is important.  According to our 2019 FIT report we score an 
overall "good". A system of on
-
line work orders provides VPE and all other schools in our district the opportunity to 
request, repair or r
eplace equipment and facilities in a timely manner.   A full time plant manager and a full time night 
custodian maintain school facilities. The OUSD Maintenance and Operation Department also support our site with major 
improvements and repairs. Currently w
e also have an integrated pest management plan monitored by the facilities 
department which includes weekly inspection of the campus by pest control professionals.  Quarterly safety inspections 
are conducted by the site principal and custodian and are reco
rded with the district. Our Home and School League works 
in conjunction with our OUSD facilities department to raise funds for upgrades to the school property that benefit 
students, such as the re
-
carpeting and painting all classrooms, and fundraising for 
a new shade structure. This year, several 
major repairs and improvements were undertaken through Orange Unified including new bathroom fixtures in 4 
bathrooms (toilets, partisans, sinks)

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade elev
en. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabil
ities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The partnership of parents and staff at VPE is exemplary.  A large cadre of classroom parent volunteers enhance teachers' 
ability to provide small group instruction and assistance to students throughout the school day. We have several parent 
organizations 
who are actively involved in both programming decisions and fundraising for activities that enrich and 
support students' experience. These organizations include our Home and School League, Dad's Club, School Site Council, 
and English Language Learner Advis
ory Council. All parents are welcome to participate in these groups. The Home and 
School League and ELAC Committee each provide regular parent meetings that include a parent education component to 
keep parents up to date on student learning and enhance und
erstanding of how parents can support their students at 
home. Meeting times for each organization are posted and updated regularly on the calendar at the Villa Park Elementary 
School website.  The Home and School League and Dad's Club Club also provide man
y social opportunities such as Family 
Fun Night, Carnival, and Camp Bobcat so families can get to know each other throughout the school year. Information can 
be found on our H&SL website: http://www.vpe
-
hsl.org/. The staff annually provides parent educatio
n opportunities, 
which are also posted on the website, related to areas of instructional focus such as science, technology, and behavior 
management.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019

32289, a Comprehensive 
Safe School Plan particular to their site. Each school site is required annually, by March 1st, to have reviewed, and if 
necessary, updat
e their Safe School Plan. Each school forwards its Safe School Plan to the district through the Student 
Services Community (SCS) Office. The SCS provides plan development assistance to the schools and maintains a file of 
individual school plans available f
or inspection by the public. The school plan was updated and reviewed by the staff and 
School Site Council in February, 2019. The staff is trained annually at the start of the school year. We continue to revisit 
and adjust the plan as need.
 
 
Providing a sa
fe environment for our students is of paramount concern here at VPE and a comprehensive disaster plan is 
in effect. In compliance with SB 187, the School Site Council has prepared a Safe School Plan, which is on file in the school
 
office and is available u
pon request. Villa Park Elementary is continually refining its disaster preparedness throughout the 
year.  Annually, emergency supplies are checked and updated as needed. Fire drills are conducted monthly and earthquake 
and lockdown drills are conducted qu
arterly. Drills are practiced in a variety of scenarios such as during lunch or recess, 
evacuation of buildings after a serious earthquake, and student
-
 
parent reunification procedures. Staff are updated 
annually on evacuation procedures both on and off si
te. Annual fire inspections by the Fire Marshall verify that regular 
emergency drills are conducted and evacuation signs are posted. We consult annually with our School Resource Officer 
who trains staff in procedures for a lockdown or active shooter situat
ion. Health support is available during all school 
hours and student medications and health needs are a regularly part of our emergency planning.  The school maintains an 
AED in the office and all staff are trained in its use and importance in saving lives

*The curriculum and student needs demonstrated by data determine the major areas of focus for staff development 
activities. Instructional strategies are linked to content standards and assessment results. The schedule of site selected 
trainings is determin
ed by the principal in conjunction with the site Instructional Leadership Team. Our district also 
provides us with regular professional development opportunities determined by district curriculum leaders. For the 2018
-
2019 school year the major focus at bo
th at the site and district level is increasing small group instruction and engagement 
in math in order to increase achievement. Professional development ensures that math is integrated with existing 
initiatives such as Write from the Beginning and AVID ar
e also critical.to successful implementation. Teachers were given 
a partial day to attend another school site implementing math specific strategies. In the 2019
-
20 school year teachers are 
given the opportunity to spend partial days visiting other school s
ites with exemplary AVID and math strategies as they 
correlate to our school site goals.
 
 
* Staff Development activities are ongoing for teachers and are provided in a variety of formats. Modified Wednesdays 
allow for teachers to receive focused 
workshops and participate in structure planning time. The district also provides 
frequent voluntary after school professional development on topics such as integration of technology.  Release time is 
provided at the beginning of the school year for teacher
s to work with district experts on identifying and planning for the 
needs of their students, particularly English Learners, low income and foster youth.  Teachers are sent to outside 
conferences when student needs are evident that cannot be met through the
 
site and district offerings. For example in 
2018
-
2019 we will be sending teachers to conferences on social emotional learning. In 2019
-
20 we sent teachers to 
training on restorative justice for 2 days.
 
 
* Teachers are supported in implementing new instruc
tional strategies through observation and dialogue with the site 
principal, as well as through planning and coaching opportunities and classrooms support with a variety of district experts. 
These include a technology coach, an English Language Development 
Specialist who is available throughout each 
trimester, and iLead coach for teachers/principal who applied and was awarded the opportunity. .
