By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents are actively involved in the educational programs at Glenwood Elementary School through School Site Council 
(SSC), Teacher
-
Parent Club (TPC), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), District ELAC, clas

a wide variety of activities such as the Fall Festival, Book Faire, Heritage Night, ELD Potlucks, Honor Roll, TPC sp
onsored 
family events, and Glenwood Family Nights. There is a high level of parent participation on field trips. Some of the field 
trip opportunities offered to students are third grade students experience California as it was in the 1800's through Valley 
Days and each May they take an overnight field trip where third graders learn and see the wonders of Yosemite. The 
Yosemite Trip is usually attended by almost all third grade parents. The classroom teachers and site administrator host a

Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Glenwood School has a School Safety Plan that was prepared by administrators, certificated and classified staff, and 
parents.  All staff provide a proactive approach to maintain a safe school.  Bullying is not tolerated 
and students and staff 
are trained in PBIS.  Students are "caught being good" and can earn rewards for good behavior.  In addition, the school is 
participating in the Leader In Me program.  In our third year, we are focusing on academic achievement through
 
best 
teaching practices.  Staff is provided opportunities for training related to assaultive behavior, active shooter, crisis 
response, child abuse, and suicide prevention.  Students and staff take great pride in Glenwood School.  The school serves 
as a c
ommunity center for club meetings, Extended Learning Program (After School Program), youth sports, community 
activities and tutorial programs after school.  The school grounds also serve as a park, the baseball diamonds are used by 
the community Little Lea
gue organization, the field is used for Linden Youth Soccer, and the Multi
-
purpose Room hosts 
basketball practices and games.  Vandalism at Glenwood School is minimal.  Glenwood staff is regularly visible during 
school events such as Citizenship Assemblies
, School hosted dances, and Honor Roll Assemblies.

During the 2019
-
2020 school year, the district focused on the Social Emotional development of children.  This included 
guest speakers on brain
-
based learning, trauma informed practices, and the Nurtured Heart 
philosophy.  Teachers were 
able to use social emotional screener data to support students with growth mindset, self
-
efficacy, self
-
awareness, and 
social awareness in the classrooms and around school grounds.  The district also adopted the initiative #ICANH
ELP to 
educate and empower students to use social media positively.  To support safe campuses, the district received 
professional development and began implementation of the H.E.R.O. program to teach students how to prevent and 
survive active shooter incid
ents and other types of violent threats.
 
 
During the 2018
-
2019 school year, the district focused on Kagan Strategies for Student Engagement.  All three professional 
development days were focused on instructional strategies designed to promote cooperation a
nd communication in the 

 
 
During 2017
-
2018 school year, the district Professional Development for teachers has focused on Next Generation Science 
Standards.  There are
 
three full training days with county guided science experts.  Teachers then work in grade level 
groupings to further prepare the science materials for classroom instruction.  In addition, many of the early release 
Wednesdays during the school year have al
so been devoted to continued training with the NGSS.   The district has also 
established a Science Cadre in which designated grade level teachers (voluntary) were trained to assist their grade level 
in deeper understanding of NGSS and their implementation.
   
Also, during the summer preceding this school year, the 
district invited teachers to meet by grade level with a trainer from the publisher of our new math curriculum.  The purpose 
of the week long session was to create a usable, consistent pacing guide 
for mathematics instruction by grade level.
 
 
The district has also hired two instructional coaches.  One is focused on ELA and ELD instructional strategies while the 
other is focused on mathematics instruction and utilizing technology in the classroom.  Th
ey are functioning to do district 
or site training as well as working with individual teachers in the classroom.  These coaches are funded through Title I 
categorical funds.
 
 
Instructional aides are provided training both from outside sources (usually coun
ty office of education opportunities) as 
well as individual one
-
on
-
one training to be sure they possess skills and strategies for teaching literacy.  Custodial and 
Maintenance staff have received a full day of training in strategies related to their positi
ons.  The secretarial staff receives 
annual training in areas affecting the current legal requirements they must know to perform their jobs accurately.
 
 
At Glenwood, additional training opportunities for teachers and aides outside of the regular school day
 
are available on 
occasion.  Some of this training includes English Language Development, SBAC Assessment training, Technology, AVID, 
NGSS, etc.  During site PD days, the staff is learning a variety of student engagement strategies this school year. In add
ition, 
the Leader in Me program continues training and development with the staff.  Academic development is the focus this 
year with teaching strategies incorporated into the training.
