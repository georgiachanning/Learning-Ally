By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

THE DENTON MISSION
 
High academic achievement is central at Denton Elementary School, yet we possess a higher value for INDIVIDUAL
 
STUDENT GROWTH. It is important to us that we support and foster the academic and social
-
emotional learning of each 
Denton Dragon irrespective of his/her starting point. We want our school to be a safe place for students to make mistakes, 
self
-
reflect, an
d uphold a growth mindset as they learn at challenging levels.
 
 
We share a belief that all students and adults bring VALUE to the Denton family. We will always seek to model high 
standards of CARE and KINDNESS, and we are committed to explicitly teaching t
hese values to our dragons. The inclusion 
of students with special needs is fundamental to our Denton family, and we will seek to create a school community that 
lives out acceptance, empathy, and friendship.
 
 
We are educators who believe that EVERY STUDENT
 
should experience SUCCESS within the walls of our school, and it is 
our role to foster, nurture, and find those areas that can be celebrated. Adults will work diligently to provide clarity in o
ur 
communication of student expectations
-
 
both behaviorally an
d academically. We want our school to be a positive, joy
-
filled place where both student and adult learning is engaging, meaningful, and collaborative.
 
 
At Denton, we want to develop our dragons into RESPECTFUL CITIZENS who are growing in their ability to 
act responsibly. 
Curiosity and academic questioning will be encouraged and fostered. Hard work, ambition, and scholarly habits will be 
nurtured. All voices will be considered and honored. Student leaders will be developed through teamwork and 
accountabilit
y. Our dragons will be taught to support one another in ways that build connections and cultivate growth.
 
 

in the education of each 
Denton Dragon, and we will always seek to foster strong lines of communication. It is our hope

Parents play an integral role in the education of our Denton Dragons. Whether parents volunteer in our classrooms, 
support our school 
through special school events, volunteer via the PTA, serve on the School Site Council or English 
Language Advisory Committee, or help their children at home with homework, we value the contributions of our family 
members. Most importantly, we appreciate w
hen parents value their children's education by attending parent
-
teacher 
conferences and maintaining clear communication with their child's teacher. We welcome our parents' involvement and 
appreciate their support.
 
 
Parents who would like more information 
on how to become involved may contact Principal, Stephanie Gendron at (559)

Ensuring the safety of students and staff is a primary concern at Denton Elementary School. The Comprehensive School 
Safety Plan is designed to assist in maintaining a safe school environment and ensuring preparedness for unforeseen 
emergencies. This plan 
identifies and addresses any security needs, prevention and intervention strategies, evaluation of 
physical facilities, and plans for communicating with staff and students. The safety plan is reviewed annually, updated as 
needed, and fully compliant with s
tate and federal regulations. This plan is updated and reviewed by faculty and School 
Site Council during the month of November each school year.  An updated copy is available to the public at the school 
office.
 
 

ludes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Emergency 
preparedness drills are conducted regularly and the school staff is appropriately trained.
 
 
To ensure the safety of students and staff, Denton Elementary School has a closed cam
pus with a single point of entry 
during the school day. All entrances to school grounds are secured and monitored; and all visitors must sign in at the 
school office and wear appropriate identification while on campus.

The following areas of professional development have been provided to staff: professional learning communities, PBIS, 
effective math and literacy instruction and other areas as indicated by school data.  Our district 
provides professional 
development based on data from both the district and school level to ensure that areas of need are being addressed.  
Professional Development occurs at the district, school and classroom level dependent on teacher goals.  The district
 
provides Teachers on Special Assignment at all grade levels to provide on
-
site coaching and support after professional 
development has occurred.
 
 
Support for Novice Teachers:  Due to a shortage of highly qualified teachers in our area, twenty percent of V


challenge and in compliance with the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, Visalia Unified offers a robust 
suppo
rt and training system for these novice educators including differentiated professional development and continuous 
professional growth opportunities.  The professional learning system begins with the New Certificated Staff Summer 
Institute which is a five
-
day interactive training offered in August one week before school begins.  This training covers 
classroom management, classroom culture, curriculum frameworks, and lesson design. In addition, a four
-
day workshop 
on student engagement and cooperative learni
ng is offered during winter break so that teachers may implement new 
structures and strategies during the spring semester.  All novice teachers receive ongoing support and individualized 
training throughout the year via weekly meetings with their assigned 
mentor at their respective school sites.  Mentors 
and district teachers
-
on
-
assignment support implementation of new knowledge by providing in
-
class coaching, 
collaborating on lesson design, accompanying novice teachers on classroom tours, and assisting wit
h student data analysis 
to drive instructional decisions.  In addition, novice teachers and their mentors attend monthly after school training in 
action research and are provided time to reflect on their instructional practice.   Mentors and teachers on as
signment are 
carefully selected experienced educators trained in how to facilitate the individualized professional growth of novice 
teachers.  Novice teachers who have preliminary credentials participate in the VUSD Teacher Induction Clear Credential 
Progr
am which is accredited by the Commission and is offered at no cost to the candidate.
 
 
Support for Veteran Teachers:  Veteran teachers in need of classroom management assistance also have access to one
-
on
-
one mentor support as may be needed in the case of a
 
new grade level assignment or challenging class.  Visalia Unified 
also offers a Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) program which is a formal system of mentoring and accountability.
