School Description
 
Niles Elementary School is unique.  The historic Spanish adobe buildings create an ideal learning 
environment for our students.  Nestled between the legendary downtown district, the picturesque 
foothil
ls, and a park, it is easy to forget that we are located in the larger city of Fremont.  Since 1875 
our school has been an integral part of the Niles Township Community, which values its historical 
roots, treasures its small town lifestyle, and cherishes i
ts partnership with Niles School.  Similar to 
most small towns, the school is the heartbeat of the community.  Community members understand 
that children are our most precious resource, that education is the foundation for success, and that 
staff, parents,
 
and children must work harmoniously to ensure success for all.
 
 

school.  Our school is an active community of staff, students, and parents.  
Parents are welcomed 
at the school and can be seen volunteering in the classroom, teaching music and art lessons, and 
coordinating schoolwide community events such as the Halloween Carnival, Bulldog Jog, and 

 
 
We are a school with diversity i

suburban areas.  Our students thrive, as shown by our high test scores on state and district 
assessments.  Our continued success is built on our commitment to our students which resulted in 
our
 
school being named a California Distinguished School in 2014.
 
 
While we focus our instruction on high academic standards, the staff is aware that our goal is to 
develop the whole child.  We strive to develop well rounded, intellectually curious, lifelong 
learners 
who will become productive members of society.  Students experience the joy of art and music 
through instruction in visual and performing arts, learn about environmental studies through 
hands
-
on experiences in the science lab and classroom experie
nces, and become socially conscious, 
respectful individuals.
 
 
At Niles School we are continuing a tradition that began close to 150 years ago when the original 
school opened with Miss Watkins as the teacher 

 
where every child is treated as an individual, 

adults who are committed to helping them flourish.
 
 
This year we will celebrate the 80th anniversary of our current school building.
 
 
Vision Statement
 
Niles Scho
ol holds the belief that all students can learn and succeed. We also believe that the 
academic and emotional needs of our students are met through quality core instruction, innovative 
programs, and an emphasis on character development.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
N
iles School supports the whole child by maintaining an inclusive community model, differentiating 
instruction, and collaborating with families to provide our students with an enriching and 
academically challenging learning environment.

About the SARC
 
By February 
1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding F
ormula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and l
ocal priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the 
school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School
 
Year 2019

The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core cla
sses for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California 
Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our main building was constructed in 1939.  During the summer of 2009, the third phase of a modernization project was complet
ed.  The modernization 
work included seismic upgrades, Ameri
cans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements, replacement of the fire alarm system, upgrades on selected door 
hardware, provisions for emergency exit lighting, upgrades to heating and air
-
conditioning units, interior and exterior painting, upgrades to the
 
student 
and staff restrooms, new windows, new classroom carpets in the main building, and reseeding the turf on the main playground. 
A new playground 
structure was installed this year and was opened to students on September 19, 2017. Our Information Techn
ology (IT) infrastructure was upgraded in 
2017. The IT project improved the quality of connectivity and the ability of our instructional staff to incorporate technolog
y in the classroom. In 2019, a 
new sound, telephone, clock and bell system was installed.
 
 
Students have a large playground and turf area to play on during recess and PE.  This playground was updated in 2018, with ad
ditional components to 
be added in 2019. Our kindergarten playground will be replaced in 2020. There are two sets of student rest
rooms, with a sufficient number of toilets for 
students to use as needed.  Last year our two restrooms in the auditorium were designated gender inclusive bathrooms. We have
 
one day custodian and 
one night custodian who keep our facilities clean.  Each clas
sroom is fully cleaned every other day and restrooms are cleaned every day.  District 
maintenance staff maintains the landscaping on regular schedule and also fixes or replaces any item that the custodial staff 
cannot repair.
 
 
To determine the condition of
 
our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the Facilit
ies 

i
ons you see on this report.  
Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report. Since that time, those
 
conditions may have changed.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

School 
Safety Plan
 
To ensure a safe and secure learning environment at Niles School, we focus on safety and health as a schoolwide priority.  Ou
r Safety Committee works 
collaboratively with staff to regularly assess our campus for potential hazards and revise and
 
update emergency procedures if necessary.  The plan is 
reviewed with staff at the beginning of the school year.

place emergencies.  Each classroom contains an emergency backpack with necessary supplies, parent release information, portab
le toilet, 
and a mobile container with food for students.  There is a disaster supply shed located on site 
which contains emergency medical supplies, search and 
rescue equipment, and water.  The school has an evacuation bell system and a smoke and fire detector system in every room in 
the school to protect the 
facility. Monthly fire drills, and quarterly disast
er and lockdown drills, are held each year.
 
 
Staff or paid supervisors monitor the school grounds before and after school, at all recesses, and lunch time.  Teachers regu
larly review the rules for safe, 
responsible behavior in school.  We have a closed cam
pus that is fenced.  Visitors must sign in at the office, where they receive a badge to wear throughout 
their stay.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some time 
each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach.  Below is the amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
2017
-
201
8: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations these days are sometimes reduced.
