About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condit
ion and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annua
l school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the Calif
ornia 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Madera Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018, and determined that each school within t
he district had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of Californ
ia. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the textbo
oks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the state are reviewed by all teachers and a
 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
mater
ials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.
 
 
The table displays information collected in October, 2019 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Howard School was originally constructed in 1953 and is comprised of 25 classrooms, one multipurpose room/cafeteria, one libr
ary, one staff lounge, 
one computer lab, and one playground.
 
 
During the summer of 2017 Howard rece
ived a face lift including, carpet in all the classrooms, office and staff room. The original bathrooms were fully 
remodeled with new appliances, tile and paint. There was a new paint job on the exterior of the school and a new marquee was 
installed as wel
l.
 
During 2018 the multi
-
purpose cafeteria/auditorium received a brand new paint job, projector, screen and speakers. The library also received a pain
t 
job, all new furniture as well as approximately $30,000 worth of new books.
 
 
Playground space is adequat
e for the number of students we have, providing them with ample opportunity to be active during their recess times. There 
is adequate space for staff to work.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
 
The principal works daily with the custodial staff of 2 full
-
time employees to
 
ensure that the school is maintained to provide for a clean and safe school. 
They work a staggered shift schedule with one of them available on campus from 6:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. A three
-
person team from the district 
maintenance department services the la
rger maintenance needs about every six weeks. The district makes a great effort to ensure that all schools are 
clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State 
of California Office
 
of School 
Construction. The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these
 
standards is available at the 
district office for review.
 
 
 
The school grounds are clean and safe thanks to the efforts of many people. Howard has its own custodial staff that takes car
e of daily cleaning and 
maintenance. Classrooms are cleaned daily.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that
 
the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and work orders are completed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest priority is given to emergency repairs. While reviewing th
is report, please note
 
that 
even minor discrepancies are reported in the inspection process. The items noted in the table have been corrected or are in t
he process of remediation.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance P
rogram, which provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist school 
districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically this includes r
oofing, plumbing, heating, 
electrical systems,
 
interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible studen

may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Howard School offers many ways for parents to be involved with the school 
and help students achieve. Parents are welcome to join the School Site 
Council (SSC), which works with the Principal to make financial and program decisions for special

Parents organize volunteers through the Howard Parent Teacher Club (PTC) to help with special fund raising to support project
s in the classroom, and 
field trip expenses. The Howard PTC purchases instructional materials, provi
des scholarships, and organizes special assemblies and carnivals. The group 
pays for educational field trips, and outdoor education (camp) with fundraisers they organize and manage.

Staff members build teaching skills and concepts by participating in many conferences and workshops throughout the year. They
 
are then provided 
opportunities to share their experiences and knowledge with district colleagues.
 
 
Tuesday early outs are dedicat
ed to teacher collaboration, PLC time and staff training from 1:30 
-
 
3:15. Per our strategic action plan, our focus this year 
is to grow in our math achievement using data as collected from our 15 Day Plan and shared out in meaningful PLC time. In add
ition
, we are continuing 
to focus on a balanced literacy program by focusing on individual instruction during guided reading groups, close reading str
ategies and an increased use 
of thinking maps. An intentional ELD and intervention time for each grade level wi
ll remain our focus. We have been gathering meaningful data to 
understand our students and the instructional implications. Our district academic coaches have come out to train us in standa

-
day cycles. In addition, we have had trainin
g dealing with Trauma Informed Care, Write from the Beginning, Pathways to Proficiency, Guided Reading, 
and Close Reading Strategies.
 
 
The district has provided training for our 7th and 8th grade teachers to collaborate with the Junior HIgh teachers from o
ther schools in the district.
 
 
Finally, grades 2
-
8 are focusing on using the NWEA tool to monitor our growth in Math and ELA and again, determine the instructional implicatio
ns to 
make adjustments and fill learning gaps as seen in the data. Grades K

using data to target instruction and make adjustments to get progress 
percentages to 80% or higher.
