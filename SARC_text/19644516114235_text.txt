About the SARC
 
By Febru
ary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fundi
ng Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state a
nd local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the sch
ool, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School 
Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our school provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. Classrooms, bathrooms, and general areas a
re in good repair and 
receive basic cleaning on a daily basis. Deta
iled cleaning is done during vacation periods. The district provides maintenance services on a regular schedule 
or when an emergency occurs.
 
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors are pr
oactive and conduct inspections at 
school sites on a continual basis. The district administers a scheduled maintenance program to ensure a suitable learning env
ironment. At the time this 
report was published, all restrooms on campus were in good working or
der. Daily reports of incidents that require repair at the school sites are processed 
through work orders. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The remaining incidents are handled on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis to ensure 
efficient service
.
 
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building compone
nts. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, 

rred maintenance plan is available 
at the district office.
 
 
To determine the condit
ion of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the 
Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction.
 
 

questions you see on this report. Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of 
the date of the report. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool loc
ated on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/

Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at 
public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Interne
t at 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first

Our school is a closed campus. All visitors are required to sign
-

other campus supervisors monitor activity and ensure student
 
safety.
 
 
A Comprehensive School Safety Plan, which is reviewed annually, was developed by the school staff to provide students and sta

safe and orderly learning environment. Components of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan include:
 
child abuse reporting procedures, teacher 
notification of dangerous pupils procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe arrival and departure from sch
