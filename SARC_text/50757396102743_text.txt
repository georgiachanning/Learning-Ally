About the SARC
 
B
y February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contro
l Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
An assessment was done in August 2019 using t
he Facility Inspection Tool (FIT).  Brown Elementary is currently a Williams School; as such this inspection 
was completed by SCOE representative John Cicinato. The school buildings and grounds of Brown Elementary have been deemed to 

fu

f the District Safety 
Inspections and Williams Inspections are maintained on file in the Turlock Unified School District Maintenanc
e and Operations office. Safety: A safety 
plan is in effect. Certificated and classified staffs are vigilant in maintaining student safety. All staff wear identificati
on badges and all visitors check in 
and out at the school office. Cleanliness: Brown Scho
ol employs one full
-
time Lead Custodian who provides students and staff with a clean and safe 
school environment throughout the day. Our district additionally employs two full time night custodians who are responsible f
or cleaning all facilities on 
a daily
 
basis. All state and district guidelines governing the custodian tasks have been implemented and are followed in accordance w
ith all applicable 
laws. Improvements: Brown School was modernized in 2012
-
13 which included the complete remodel of all classroom
s, restrooms, office and many 
other campus features.  In addition to the modernization the M&O department oversaw a complete replacement of all playground 
asphalt during the 
summer of 2015. In the summer of 2017 and 18 perimeter fence was completely replac
ed and in the Fall of 2019 a new office building was completed 
and opened to enhance safety and security with a single point of entyr. Adequacy: The Turlock Unified School District prides 
itself in offering clean, safe 
and adequate school facilities. Our b
uildings offer adequate heat and air and are maintained in accordance with stringent state and district guidelines. 
FIT Results: The FIT form dated August 8, 2019 may list some items found during the site inspection. These items should not b

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of 
study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smart

Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3
