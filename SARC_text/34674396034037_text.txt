Vision:
 
The Leataata Floyd Elementary School staff and its stakeholders are striving to establish and 
maintain a culture on our campus where all students are encouraged and supported in striving for 
excellen
ce academically, socially, and emotionally in a safe and nurturing atmosphere.  Our goal is 
to work in partnership with our parents, community, and stakeholders to create an environment 
where students are empowered to discover their strengths and achieve t
heir maximum potential.  
In so doing, we desire to be a staff that develops and presents a responsive curriculum wherein the 
necessary first instruction, enrichment, and interventional supports are embedded with purpose 
and care so that all students and ar
e readied for college and career.
 
 
Mision:
 
In order to bring such a vision into fruition, the staff of Leataata Elementary School and its 
stakeholders will commit themselves to work in a collegial and collaborative way to support student 
achievement. The i
nstructional staff will focus on the research based forums for accelerated 
academic improvement: Whole Child Approach to Learning, Project Based Learning, Balanced 
Literacy, Positive Behavior Intervention and Support, Culturally/Linguistically Responsive T
eaching 
strategies, data analysis, Mindful practices, Restorative Justice Practices, Inclusive Practices, Social 
Emotional Learning, and common/ collaborative instructional planning. By focusing on these 
proven approaches and practicing them relentlessly, 
our service to students, parents, and 
community will result in the following: accelerate student academic achievement, reduction in the 
Achievement Gap, college and career readiness, and the realization of hopes and dreams.  Once 
accomplished, our students
 
will leave Leataata Floyd knowing how to benefit from their learning 
experience in Sacramento City Unified School District, how to get help accomplishing their goals, 
and will have the skills and confidence to succeed.

About the 
SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local 
Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to ad
dress 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information 
about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The district instructional material evaluat
ion committee, consisted of members representing teachers, administrators, other staff, students, 
parents/guardians, and community, ensures that the selected textbooks, technology
-

Recommendations for the adoption and/or withdrawal of instructional materials by the instructional material evaluation commit
tee are presented to 
the Board by the Superintendent or designee and include documentation supporting the recomme
ndation. In some instances, the considered textbooks 
and/or instructional materials are piloted for a period of time before being recommended for adoption to the Board of Educati

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities);

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is 
imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including
 
ELA Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Linguistically Relevant Teaching and 
Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through thi
s program deeply align with the needs of our individual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and connect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional in
structional practices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson
 
design.
 
 
Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outside of contracted hours. In addition to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunit
y for teachers to engage in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening their content knowledge, strengthening their instruct
ional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of 
responsibility.
