By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Volta Elementary School is one of the three remaining original grammar schools that made up the West Side Union School 
District. The original school was built in 1890. The existing facility w
as constructed in 1959. The school has five permanent 
classrooms and seventeen portable classrooms. In addition to the classrooms, the campus has an office, library, 
cafeteria/kitchen/multi
-
purpose room, computer lab, and houses two Severely Handicapped Cl
asses which are operated 
by the Merced County Office of Education. Volta also has a morning and afternoon LBUSD preschool.  The school is housed 
on 6.8 acres and is on a traditional calendar. The rural setting of Volta School, complete with a view of the W
estern hills, 
cows across the fence, and a small school population, provides a peaceful, family
-
like environment for our students and 
staff. Students learn best when a supportive and enriched learning environment is provided. The Volta staff works 
cooperat

academic growth.
 
 
The Volta Elementary School staff has aligned all instruction to the California Common Core State Standards. Teachers 
develop pacin
g calendars, curriculum maps, and lesson plans which are reviewed and revised to meet the academic needs 
of all students. Teachers meet weekly to review assessment results and to develop action plans to assist students with 
learning and to provide universa
l access to the core curriculum. Student Study Team meetings are held to help teachers 
plan for struggling students. At
-
risk students are offered intervention services. Many tools are used to measure student 
academic achievement. Classroom assessments are 
used to determine initial reading and math levels. Assessment 
components of the District created Units of Study for reading and math are used to determine progress.   Beginning in the 
2014
-
2015 school year, students have been given the Smarter Balanced Ass
essment to determine mastery of California 
Common Core State Standards.
 
 
Volta Elementary School teachers are observed and evaluated by the principal on a regular basis. Tenured teachers are 
evaluated every two years. Non 

tenured teachers are evaluated ea
ch year. The evaluation process follows a District 
adopted timeline and aligns to the California Standards for the Teaching Profession. Individual teachers and the principal 
collaborate to discuss and set improvement goals.
 
 
Volta teachers have been focuse
d on teaching the standards, assessing student progress, analyzing data, and adjusting 
instruction as needed. Volta students have been focused on working diligently to learn grade level standards. An 
intervention class has been established to provide speci
fic and intense instruction and support for students struggling to 
learn to read.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Volta remains in overall good repair.  The major concern on campus is replacing window coverings throughout the campus.  
This is also a major issue that was brought up by the Merced County Sheriff's Department to help with safety and security 
in the event 
of a lockdown.  Volta custodians work closely with the LBUSD FOT department to quickly repair any issues 
that happen throughout the year.  New this year are three brand new classrooms, one of which is being occupied this 
year.  These additions are all in g
ood repair.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

in the workings of the school.
 
 
In the 2018
-
19 school year, Volta began offering classes to parents through the Parenting Partners program, and this 
continued into the 2019
-
10 school year. This program will be hosted on the Volta campus 8 Thursday morning
s in the Fall 
and early Spring.
 
 
Parents wishing to volunteer should follow the LBUSD Volunteer Policy.  The first step is to visit the main office at Volta 
and pick up a packet from Laurie Sadler, Administrative Assistant.  Upon completion of the packet, 
the principal and district 
office will review the packet.  If approved, the voluteer will need to be finger printed have a clear TB test, and complete 
mandated reporter training.

School Safety Plan (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
The Volta staff is committed to the safety and well
-
being of our students. The School Safety Committee meets  to discuss 
areas of concern and to direct corrective action. Three full
-
time custodians work to maintain the cleanliness and safe
ty of 
classrooms, common buildings, the playground, and playground equipment. The campus is also serviced by the District 
grounds and maintenance crews. School vandalism and crime are reported monthly to the District Office. Fortunately, 
there is little to
 
report. A comprehensive School Site Safety Plan has been developed for Volta School that meets or 
exceeds state standards for child safety and protection. This plan was reviewed and updated in November 2019.  Input 
was collected from the Merced County She
riff's Department.  It was discussed with staff and School Site Council members 
at the beginning of school staff meeting and the November Site Council meeting.  Student discipline issues are minimal 
and are handled according to the site discipline plan. Th
e 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement is available at the school 
office.

In addition to the two full

at Volta School improve their teaching skills by participating in professional development workshops 
throughout the year. 
On campus, professional development is sometimes provided during weekly collaboration meetings. Once a month, 
teachers meet with the Volta Math coach to improve Math instruction and incorporate discourse into all disciplines.  
Teachers
 
also have the opportunity to participate in trainings provided by the District, and to attend outside conferences 
and trainings. Current professional development topics include Rigorous Curriculum Design Units for Language Arts and 
Math, close reading and
 
writing strategies for grades 2
