School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The 
Poway Unified School District ensures that students attend clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each o
f its schools is maintained in good repair.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well main
tained.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and well maintained.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A night custodial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms and offices daily.  
The district has adopted cleaning standards for a
ll schools.  A summary of these standards is available at the district offices.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Canyon View places strong emphasis on safety for students and staff. Emergency plans are reviewed yearly. Annual 
training procedures and drills for earthquakes, fire, lock down/secure campus and bus evacuation are held. All monthly 
and semester drills are 
conducted and recorded per California State Law. Maintenance staff work with a scheduled 
preventive program to offset costly repairs. Extended Student Services are available to students for before and after school 
childcare. We have a School Safety Patrol 
sponsored by the San Diego Police Department and Gatekeepers assist students 
on campus. Canyon View students are aware of behavior expectations as they are clearly stated in
 
the Student Handbook, 
which is distributed to all students and parents at the begi
nning of the year .We have incorporated the Six Pillars of Good 
Character throughout our school. Our rules are discussed in class, in behavior assemblies and communicated to parents, 
whose signatures are required in support of our policy. We have zero tole
rance when it comes to violence and hateful 

referral to the principal. These strategies are presented in library presentations.
 
Our coun
selor presents lessons in the 
classroom and also meets with students individually or in small groups to talk about social skills. Every morning on the 
intercom, a Project Wisdom message is read which
 
encourages students to make good choices.
 
Our noon dutie
s have 
attended inservices on helping students with conflict and have learned positive behavior interventions. Before and after 
school, we have a group of students who serve as Gatekeepers, reminding their classmates of appropriate behavior. We 
celebrate k
indness throughout our school and classrooms.
 
 
One way students are recognized for kindness is through 
Bucketfilling cards and rewards and are recognize weekly on our morning announcements.
