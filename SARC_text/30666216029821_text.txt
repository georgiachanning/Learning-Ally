By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Jordan Academy's modernization was completed in April 2008. Maintaining the appearance, safety and functionality of 
Jordan Academy is a priority
 
in the Orange Unified School District. The safety of buildings and grounds are of utmost 
importance, and renovations and improvements are scheduled as resources permit. In the summer of 2018, Jordan 
Academy's exterior was repainted.
 
 
Other 
facility renovations included bathrooms and water fountains that are handicap accessible. Handicapped ramps were 
installed throughout the school. The 70 building was reconfigured to include the school library, a work space for the speech 
specialist, psycho
logist and school nurse. A computer lab was installed with built
-
in desks for 33 computers, a teaching 
station and a laser printer for student use. The computer lab and classrooms are wired to provide students with internet 
access. The computer lab has an 
LED TV Monitor that is utilized by classroom teachers to model technology as a learning 
tool.
 
 
There is adequate classroom space and playground area for all students.The primary playground equipment was installed 
with special ground surfacing for safety. T
he playground is inspected by our Head Custodian to ensure it is in working 
order. The Maintenance Department ensures that our playground equipment is kept in working order and provides the 
necessary repairs immediately upon receiving a work
-
order request.
 
 
The main office building contains the teacher's workroom, administrative offices, a student health area and lobby area for 
visitors. The campus modernization included a new entry portico for the school office, new energy conserving windows, 
new stucco, n
ew paint and a new roof. A covered lunch shelter was built. New grass, shrubs, and flowers were planted 
around the school campus. The school driveway was redone to include drive through and specially marked drop off lanes. 
The back parking lot was extended
 
to include more parking. Some new fencing was installed, and all asphalt was resealed 
and striped.
 
 
The classrooms are vacuumed and cleaned on a regular basis. The restrooms and school office are cleaned and inspected 
on a daily basis by the custodial sta
ff. Any needed maintenance is taken care of by our custodians. Maintenance that 
cannot be done by the custodians is put on a district work order and taken care of in a timely and effective manner. A 
monthly inspection form is sent to the district office de
tailing the status of facilities and work orders are done for needed 
repairs. The district Emergency Crew responds to emergency repairs as soon as possible.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Jordan Academy recognizes the important role that parents play in ensuring that their children excel in their education.  
With that in mind, Jordan is committed to proving parents with many opportunities to participate in our school 
community. Parents are 
highly encouraged to participate in school events, volunteer in classrooms, attend parent 
workshops, as well as in supporting our highly motivated and dedicated PTA. Our parent involvement opportunities 
promote parents as instructional partners. Parent vol
unteers assist in classrooms,preparing instructional materials,field 
trips and other school activities. Parents are also involved encouraged to get involved in school committees. Jordan 
Academy has a School Site Council (SSC), an English Learners Advisory 
Committee (ELAC) and an active PTA. Committees 
meet regularly during the school year. The ELAC committee is comprised of parents, whose children are English Language 
learners, who review the school plan and focus on the needs of English learners and give i
nput to SSC, especially as it 
pertains to how Local Control Federal Funding will be utilized to support English Learners. The PTA promotes and has a 
goal of building stronger social interactions among our students, parents and staff that promote a sense of
 
community. 
Our School Site Council, comprised of parents and Jordan staff, is a decision making committee that focuses on the school 
budget, academic programs and student achievement. All Parents are encouraged to attend these meetings as an 
opportunity t
o provide input on how to involve parents, make decisions about how to best utilize TITLE I and LCFF funding, 
as well as to modify and monitor the School Plan.
 
 
At the beginning of the year, parents are invited to have "Coffee with the Principal", so the p
rincipal can have a chat with 
parents about new incentives or school events. Our library is opened to parents four times a week, before and after school, 
to check out books as our school wide Family Literacy Project. We also hold a Family Literacy Night an
d STEM Night during 
the year. Jordan holds monthly school wide assemblies on the first Friday of the month, where classes and students are 
recognized for perfect attendance and one Jaguar of the Month for each class.
 
 
We have a school newsletter that is 
sent home on a regular basis to announce school events and to provide families with 
ideas on how to support their children at home and support our school goals. In order to ensure all families receive all 
important information, we translate all our home
-
sc
hool communication and he we have an school wide communication 
application. In addition, each teacher has his or her own system of home/school communication so that parents are kept 

ortunities to be involved in school activities. 
Orange Unified participates with School News that publishes district news and events. Jordan staff writes articles that are 
published in the School News publication. The articles communicate the good news at 
our school and are sent home to 
parents and community in our school district. Communication of current events, news are also on Jordan Academy's social 
media pages on Facebook and Instagram. Jordan's website is also consistently updated to reflect upcoming
 
important 
dates.
 
 
There is a strong sense of community, which is rooted in the generations of families that have attended Jordan Academy. 
Some of our volunteers and donors no longer have students that attend our school and yet they continue to support our
 
school community. Jordan benefits from the support of community partnerships.Local businesses also provide assistance 
with student incentives, given at our quarterly awards assemblies. The Orange Rotary Club donated a new Kindergarten 
Playground and the E
lks Club provided dictionaries for every third grade student.
 
 
If anyone is interested in receiving more information about our volunteer opportunities or other ways to become involved 
at our school, please contact Mrs. Lorena Rubio, Principal, at (714) 997

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Each district school develops and adopts, in accordance with Education Code § 32280 

 
32289, a Comprehensive Safe 
School Plan particular to their site. Each school site is required to annually review, and if necessary, update their plan.  
Each school forwa
rds its Safe School Plan to the district through the office of Student and Community Services. The office 
of Student and Community Services provides plan development assistance to the schools and maintains a file of individual 
school plans available for in
spection by the public.
 
 
A Comprehensive School Safety and Disaster Preparedness Plan is revised by the Instructional Leadership Team, also our 
Safety Team, and is put in effect at the beginning of every school year. The Safety Plan is reviewed and updated
 
by the 
Principal, ILT, Staff and SSC. The Safety Plan was reviewed and was last approved by the School Site Council on January 24, 
2019 and was reviewed and approved by March  2019. The plan and emergency procedures were discussed at our first 
staff meeti
ng of the year, August 21, 2019.  Our ILT reviewed the school plan at our first ILT Meeting of the year on October 
14, 2019. Fire, earthquake and other disaster drills are conducted monthly or quarterly.  In compliance with SB187, the 
safety committee has 
prepared a Safe School Plan, which is on file in the school office and is available for review upon 
request. Key elements of our Safety Plan include information on how we keep our campus safe for students on a daily 
basis, and our specific plan for dealing
 
with strangers on campus (campus lock
-
down), our procedures in case of fire or a 
disaster.  There is also an explanation of our school
-
wide discipline plan, how it is implemented and preventive measures 
dealing with bullying.
 
 
In order to ensure the safet
y of all our students, the school is completely fenced. Jordan operates under a closed campus 
policy during school hours. All visitors on campus must enter through the school office to obtain a visitor pass before 
entering the school grounds. There are fou
r supervisors assigned to lunch duty supervision. Certificated staff members 
are assigned to supervisory duties during recess and before and after school.
 
 
The school and district work closely with the municipalities in establishing precautions for a possi
ble emergency. All 
schools have a red phone in the office that is to be used for emergencies and is directly linked to the District emergency 
system. An evacuation map of the school is posted in every classroom, offices, the library and computer lab.  Disa
ster 
team roles are updated each school year to reflect changes in staff.  Our ASES program, the YMCA, is also aware of our 
evacuation plan for all emergencies and also have available emergency cards for all students attending the after
-
school 
program. The
 
YMCA Coordinator also has their own emergency procedures and practice drills are also conducted.

Focus for Staff Development:
 
Jordan Academy Staff are provided professional development opportunities twice a month for 100 minutes. Our focus for 
professional development is determined by our classroom teachers in collaboration with the School Administrator. Our 
Instructional Leaders
hip Team provides feedback in planning our professional development calendar.
 
 
For the 2017
-
18 school year, Jordan focused on providing consistent small group instruction in order to increase student 
achievement, ensuring that our students developed a coll
ege and career readiness focus. This was determined by student 
data feedback, observation from SBAC testing results, Common Core State Standards, and the connection to our Districts 
Pillar of Shifts in the Application of Learning. Our staff development foc
used on teaching strategies that ensured that we 
met our goal of increasing the percentage of students proficiently able to read fluently, all while raising students lexile 
levels as the new criteria for English Learners has become more stringent.
 
For the 
2018
-
19 school year,  Jordan focused on teachers developing expertise in designing prescriptive, targeted small 
group and meaningful and purposeful independent English Language Arts lessons based on SBAC data results. Although, 
the 17
-
18 SBAC ELA/Literacy 
data indicates that the majority of our students showed growth, students were still not 
performing at the level needed to meet the state standards in all claims. Teachers have provided differentiated small 
group instruction and have mastered effectively gr
ouping students. However, in order to increase student achievement, 
teachers needed to refine their small group instruction and further develop meaningful and purposeful lessons during 
independent time.
 
For the 2019
-
2020 school year, Jordan has implemented
 
a new Kindergarten Spanish Dual program with the integration 
of Computer Science Standards. Grades 1
-
6 are piloting Computer Science standards applications. Professional 
Development for the Dual Kinder teachers will be provided and Computer Science standa
rds professional development 
will be ongoing throughout the year for all grades.

We are in year two of implementation of a new ELA program and are fully committed to using what ever program is 
adopted to it's fullest capacity. In addition, we have added a
 
technology plan which calls for further training of appropriate 
applications of technology.  Teachers are committing to share with fellow staff members the use of apps that have proven 
to be successful in their own classrooms.  The Principal assures that 
professional development strategies are implemented 
in the classroom by doing classroom walkthroughs and providing constructive feedback on the implementation of 
professional development strategies. Teacher surveys and classroom observations by the princip
al and our ILT allow us to 
determine professional development needs. Our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) reflects the strong emphasis 
on professional development and outlines the areas and cost of staff development.  Jordan Academy will also be 
focusing 
on expanding our AVID program with the commitment to reaching our third and fourth grades more quickly.  We are 
planning to send  more teachers to the AVID Summer Institute.
 
 
Teachers receive training during our designated professional development
 
time on Wednesdays, in an Afterschool mini
-
PD model, and/or in a release time model in which substitutes are ordered.  Our SPSA reflects opportunities for teachers 
to attend conferences and/or professional development that focus on strategies that meet th
e learning needs of our 
English Learners, increase student engagement, improve our students' writing skills, just to name a few.  We are fortunate 
to have a full time Instructional Specialist that can provide individualized training to teachers based on th
eir specific needs. 
Grade levels provide support to each other in creating lessons and participating in learning walks. Teacher leaders are 
provided specific training on being effective facilitators during learning walks that focus on best instructional pr
actices.
 
 
In order to support teachers during the implementation process, our Instructional Specialist guides our teachers through 
the Cycle of Effective Instruction focusing on strategies learned during professional development. This gives teachers the 
op
portunity to implement the strategies and receive specific feedback on their delivery of instruction. During staff 
meetings, teachers are provided time to share how they implemented best practices learned during professional 
development. Principal provides
 
written feedback to teachers during classroom visits, pre/post observation conferences, 
and during Principal Chats. PLC meetings are another way in which teachers discuss implementation of PD practices 
learned and discuss how to support each other in bein
g accountable for implementing strategies.
 
 
Jordan Academy is committed to ensuring that our classroom teachers are continuously growing professional and 
receiving the most current research
-
based professional development that will impact student learning.
