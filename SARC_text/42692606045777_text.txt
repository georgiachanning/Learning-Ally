Vision
 
Statement
 
The
 
vision
 
of
 
Joe
 
Nightingale
 
School
 
is
 
to
 
provide
 
for
 
the
 
educational
 
success
 
of
 
all
 
students
 
through
 
high
 
expectations
 
and
 
a
 
commitment
 
to
 
academic
 
excellence;
 
to
 
empower
 
them
 
to
 
reach
 
their
 
full
 
potential
 
as
 
responsible,
 
ethical
 
and
 
productive
 
citizens
 
in
 
a
 
diverse
 
and
 
changing
 
world.
 
We
 
believe
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
shared
 
responsibility
 
requiring
 
the
 
cooperation
 
and
 
commitment
 
of
 
students,
 
parents,
 
staff,
 
and
 
the
 
community.
 
 
We
 
ensure
 
academic
 
excellence
 
by
 
providing
 
quality
 
educational
 
programs
 
with
 
all
 
staff
 
members
 
focused
 
on
 
continually
 
improving
 
student
 
achievement.
 
We
 
believe
 
children
 
learn
 
best
 
when
 
they
 
engage
 
in
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
meaningful
 
activities
 
in
 
a
 
challenging,
 
structured
 
and
 
positive
 
environment.
 
At

School
 
we
 
provide
 
our
 
students
 
with
 
a
 
rigorous,
 
scholarly
 
learning
 
environment
 
in
 
which
 
learning
 
time,
 
instructional
 
planning,
 
progress
 
monitoring,
 
and
 
strategic/intensive
 
interventions
 
are
 
systematically
 
focused
 
on
 
individual
 
student
 
learning
 
needs.
  
We
 
have
 
clear,
 
research-based
 
interventions
 
and
 
enrichment
 
opportunities
 
to
 
meet
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
learners
 
at
 
all
 
instructional
 
levels.
 
 
All
 
members
 
of
 
the
 
Joe
 
Nightingale
 
School
 
community
 
collaborate
 
to
 
offer
 
continuous
 
learning
 
programs
 
that
 
enable
 
all
 
children
 
to
 
maximize
 
their
 
academic,
 
social
 
and
 
emotional
 
growth
 
and
 
promote
 
their
 
development
 
into
 
thoughtful,
 
accepting,
 
productive
 
and
 
responsible
 
citizens.

to
 
ensure
 
that
 
all

original
 
facilities
 
were
 
built
 
in
 
1958.

ensure
 
facilities
 
remain
