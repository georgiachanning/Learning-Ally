About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year,
 
every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
a
ll local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities
. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Each year we have designed professional learning based on student achievement data, research of best practices and discussion
s with teachers and 
principals. In 2017
-
18, in response to stagnant test scores and challenges with collaborative planning, we bega
n working with Orenda/Principal Exchange. 
Since then, our teachers have been working to strengthen collaborative teams, refocus on essential standards and respond to t
imely data from common 
assessments.  The focus was on ELA during the 2017
-
18 and 2018
-
19 
school years. An additional content area focus (Math) was added for the 2019
-
20 
school year. At the same time, the school has been engaged in district
-
wide professional learning that varies by content area. For ELA, in 2017
-
18, the 
focus was on aligning in
struction to Smarter Balanced Assessments, depth of knowledge, and deeper understanding of the Reading Targets in Claim 1. In
 
2018
-
19 the focus was on the gradual release model, and 2019
-
20 was an extension of the previous two years. The professional devel
opment in these 
areas was provided by the Schoolhouse Project. In 2019
-
20 the teachers began working with High Impact Math consultants. This professional 

ver the course of three years.  During Year 1 
(2019
-
20) the focus is on developing strategies to support number sense by implementing mental math routines and highlight the land
scape of learning 
in mathematics. This professional development also supports t
eachers with the implementation of the district
-
adopted math program (Bridges in 
Mathematics and Number Corner).
 
The numbers in the chart above represent 10 full days a year (2017
-
18 and 2018
-
19) in which structured coaching took place during Data Reflecti
on 
Sessions and the remaining days are full days of professional learning in ELA as noted previously. During the 2019
-
20 school year the numbers in the 
chart represent 15 days a year in which structured coaching took place during Data Reflection Sessions a
nd the remaining days are full days of professional 
learning in ELA and Math.
