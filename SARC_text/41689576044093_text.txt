School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

all restrooms and the 
administrative offices in the spring of 2004.  Construction of a new gymnasium and eating area was 
completed in January 2006.  Fifteen portable classrooms have been added since 2008 to accommodate growing 
enrollment.  The lunch areas were expanded in 2014 
to accommodate additional students.  Master Plans were revised in 
Spring 2015 to provide permanent classrooms to replace all portable buildings. Construction of new 2

Opportunities for Pa
rental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Members of the community are strong supporters of the school and contribute time and resources in order to achieve the 
school and district educational goals. La Entrada has an active Parent
-
Teacher 
Association (PTA) that sponsors many 
programs annually for the benefit and welfare of students and families. Sports and enrichment activities are offered to all 
students through the Las Lomitas League, a parent organization. Parents also participate as mem
bers of our English 
Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), which helps and advises us in our plan for English Language Learners. In addition, 
parents volunteer in classrooms and help with special events, such as the School Picnic, Winter Service Project, Scie
nce 
Fair, Spelling Bee, Geo Bee, and Visual Arts Showcase. Three parents and two students are members of the School Site 
Council and are an integral part of planning school improvement. The Las Lomitas Education Foundation raised $1.600,000 
through the com
bined efforts of the Annual Giving Campaign, annual auction event, eScrip Sales, and corporate donor 
programs to enhance the educational efforts of the District. These funds are used to maintain small class sizes, to provide 
a wide array of electives, and 
to support programs and staff in all academic areas. Local businesses and corporations enrich 
our technological needs by donating equipment and financial resources. The parent
-
organized Outreach Program provides 
ongoing financial assistance and tutoring fo

Parent volunteers lead Project Cornerstone's ABC Reader Program, where parent volunteers are trained monthly in a 
selected children's book that focuses on character and anti
-
bullying themes. These parent volunteers then r
ead the 
selected children's book in a 4th or 5th grade classroom every month while being supported by the classroom teacher. 
The La Entrada Lunchtime Enrichment Program, LELE, is a weekly lunchtime recess event supported and staffed by parent

and Knit and Crochet Club
