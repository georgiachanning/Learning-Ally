About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our school provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. Classrooms, bathrooms, and general areas a
re in good repair and 
receive basic cleaning on a daily basis. Detailed clea
ning is done during vacation periods. The District provides maintenance services on a regular schedule 
or when an emergency occurs.
 
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors are proactive a
nd conduct inspections at 
school sites on a continual basis. The District administers a scheduled maintenance program to ensure a suitable learning env
ironment. At the time this 
report was published, all restrooms on campus were in good working order. Dail
y reports of incidents that require repair at the school sites are processed 
through work orders. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The remaining incidents are handled on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis to ensure 
efficient service.
 
 
The Di
strict participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typi
cally this includes roofing, plumbing, 

rred maintenance plan is available 
at the district office.
 
 
To determine the condition of ou
r facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the Facilitie
s 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction.
 
 

 
you see on this report. Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of 
the date of the report. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter

other campus supervisors monitor activity and ensure student safety.
 
 
A Comprehensive School Safety Plan, which is reviewed
 
annually, was developed by the school staff to provide students and staff a means to ensure a 
safe and orderly learning environment. Components of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan include: child abuse reporting proc
edures, teacher 
notification of dang
erous pupils procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe arrival and departure from school, sexual harassme
nt 
policy, suspension and expulsion policies, dress code, and discipline policies. The school safety committee and district pers
