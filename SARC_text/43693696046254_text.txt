By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The District makes every effort to ensure all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effo
rt, the district uses 
a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of this 
survey are available at the school office and at the district office.
 
 
McCollam School was constructed in 1958
. School facilities are being renovated according to the Field Act requirements 
of the State Building Code with a focus on earthquake safety. In the event that asbestos and lead
-
containing building 
materials are found, they are removed according to Environ
mental Protection Agency (EPA) and State and Local 
requirements. Deferred maintenance funds have been used to properly maintain and renovate district buildings. Needed 
repairs and maintenance projects are completed in a timely manner.
 
 
School facilities 
are upgraded whenever possible to support and maintain a safe, clean and secure campus. Sufficient 

 
the instructional program. The 
Alum Rock Union Elementary School District maintenance staff, in conjunction with day 
and night custodians, ensure the school buildings and grounds are safe, clean, and in good repair. Rigorous daily custodial 
schedules ensure that classrooms, lavatories, 
serving kitchens, eating areas, offices, and playgrounds are clean for both 
student and staff use.
 
 
Regular oversight by district maintenance and grounds crews ensure that grass and landscaped areas are well maintained 

nds and play areas are safe for use.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Calif
ornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternat
e achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for e
ntrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
McCollam Elementary School has a very 
detailed, comprehensive school safety plan that outlines protocols, systems, and 
procedures in the event of any/all emergencies. The plan also contains the yearly safety goals as determined by the 
students, staff, and parents. The safety plan is developed 
by the McCollam Safety Committee before it is presented 
annually to the Alum Rock Union Elementary School District Board of Trustees for approval. The revised plan was approved 
in December 2017. The Safety Plan and drill procedures are reviewed during the 
year with all staff. Safety alerts are shared 
with all staff as needed throughout the school year. In addition, all required drills are calendared and completed, and the 
results are shared with the staff. The McCollam School Safety Plan has a comprehensive
, enforceable, and continuous 
behavior policy, set of rules and regulations, dress code policy, set of protocols for safety/emergency drills, tardy policy,
 
attendance policy, referral policy, non
-
 
discriminatory policy on student rights and responsibilitie
s, campus security policy, 
harassment policy, conflict management policy, Internet safety policy, and an intervention policy.

All visitors are required to check
-
in at the school office. Fire drills and disaster procedures are specifically outlined and 
reg
ularly updated and practiced. Safety programs include drug awareness, personal safety, and personal growth. To 
ensure a safe environment, the district provides extra yard duty supervisors, and all yard duty supervisors and school staff 
maintain a welcoming
 
but controlled campus environment. The school grounds and playground are safe because they are 
well supervised by staff before, during, and after school.
 
 
Students and staff have established procedures in case of emergencies (e.g. earthquakes, bomb threat
s, etc.). In the event 
of an emergency such as earthquakes, fire, etc., the principal will ring the alarm. This means that everyone on site will be 
prepared to duck and cover and/or evacuate the building. Staff and students will not return to their classes
 
until the all
-
clear bell has been given by the administrator and/or designee.
 
 
Code Red or Tiger Time will be declared when a lock
-
down of the school needs to go into effect due to an extreme 
emergency taking place on campus. All students and teachers wil
l lock themselves in their classrooms and barricade the 
door until an administrator or designee signals the all
-
clear sign. Teachers are also aware of certain private signals they 
can use to declare a need for help or to indicate that they are all safe.
 
 
All staff has read the safety rules for the Alum Rock Union Elementary School District and have signed that they have read 
and understood the rules. The minutes from the monthly safety meetings for managers are posted in the staff room. The 
principal routi
nely notifies the staff of any safety issues or concerns.
