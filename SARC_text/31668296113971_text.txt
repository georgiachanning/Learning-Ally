About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public 
school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with s
pecific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web p
age at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For
 
additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

to
 
each and every student to support classroom instruction.  For digital curriculum components, students without devices are all
owed to loan a device 
for access at home.
 
 
Teachers may, according to need, augment these materials with activities, materials, we

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cog
nitive disabilities); and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Eureka Union School District certificated and classified staff members participate in various professional development opport
unities aligned with district 
goals, as specified in its LCAP (Local Control 
Accountability Plan). These goals were developed upon stakeholder input and analysis of various student 
outcome measures, primarily CAASPP (California Assessment of Academic Student Performance and Progress). For the last 3 years
, all certificated staff 
me
mbers participated in at least three district
-
wide professional development days per year focused on the implementation of the California Content 
Standards (ELA and Math), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and research
-
proven instructional strategie
s. Throughout the year, various 
afternoon workshops were also provided to address different topic areas: Differentiation, Universal Design for Learning, Visu
al Literacy, Vocabulary 
Instruction and others.  EUSD has also promoted a balance of growth opportu
nities in all MTSS domains 
-
 
academic, socioemotional, and behavioral.  This 
year, the district focused on practices that promote diversity awareness and appreciation, equity, and inclusion.
 
 
Summer institutes also provide teachers opportunities to extend k
nowledge and skills, plan and collaborate. During the summer of 2019, K
-
8 teachers 
were provided training on NGSS, new History & Social Studies Frameworks, STEM, using technology in the classroom, socio
-

Additionally, during the 
year, teachers participated in several regional and state conferences.

Types of Services Funded
 
Eureka Union School District is guided by its mission of "Working Together for Excellence 
-
 
Every Student, Every School, Every Day" and hence, its budget 
in 
focused on supporting high
-
quality instruction in the classroom.  The classroom is protected from funding cuts as much as possible to maintain EUSDs 
high academic performance. In a study conducted, the Eureka Union School District was found to have the hig
hest percentage of budget dollars 
concentrated in the classroom (teachers, aides, materials, equipment) relative to other districts in the region.  EUSD also b
elieves in the education of the 
whole child, and its budget reflects this commitment.  Several pr
ograms exist to support and promote socioemotional development and positive 
behavioral outcomes.  EUSD has the highest counselor to student ratio in the region.
 
 
For struggling and at
-
risk students, academic intervention support is available at all sites. 
 
Students and teaching staff also have access to technology to 
help make teaching and learning more effective.  There are instructional aides available for  providing direct support, wheth
er push
-
in or pull
-
out, to 
struggling students.  The district coordi
nates and provides support to programs that serve students representing different populations: SpEd, GATE, and 
EL. Each school site provides unique programs and resources based on identified needs.

DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/

g English learners).
 
 
Internet Access

et access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Libra
ry). Access to the Internet at 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use 
restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length 
of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation
, and the ability to print
