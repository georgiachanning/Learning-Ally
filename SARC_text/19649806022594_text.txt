About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
 
All teachers and staff in SMMUSD participate in ongoing professional development through banked time, a total of 75 minutes o
f meeting and 
professional development time each week at each site. Areas of districtwide focus for teacher and administrator profe
ssional development include 
implementation of curriculum guides and other areas that are determined by a review of summative and formative data from all 
school sites and the 
collection of input from teachers and administrators. Among the primary focus area
s for professional development in SMMUSD are the following:
 

 
Developing Professional Learning Communities
 

 
California State Standards for ELA and Math and Next Generation Science Standards

standards
-
based curriculum and instructional delivery
 

 
Using data to i
mprove classroom instruction
 

 
Supporting Tier III students, English Learners, and students with special needs
 

 
Differentiated instruction for all students
 
 
A variety of methodologies are used to provide professional development, including coaching and mentor
ing. SMMUSD provides coaching through 
several programs such as BTSA, National Boards, literacy and ELD coaching, Instructional Leadership Teams, and such specializ
ed programs as Cotsen 
Fellows and Math Coaches. Additionally, professional development occurs
 
through workshop series during banked time and/or after
-
school 
opportunities.
 
 
Each August, all teachers new to Santa Monica
-
Malibu are invited to participate in Teacher Academy, a professional development and orientation to 
districtwide curriculum and in
structional initiatives. All eligible new teachers are encouraged to participate in BTSA. Teachers interested in applying for
 
National Board Certification may participate in the process and can elect to be supported by teachers who have already achiev
ed Na
tional Board 
Certification.
 
 
The focus of professional development at McKinley for the 2019
-
20 school year is predominantly Academic Discourse in Math, effective instructional 
strategies to close the achievement gap, and social emotional learning. The Site Leadership Team (SLT), compo
sed of teachers and administrators, 
analyzed a variety of data to identify student needs (listening and speaking skills), determined a focus (Academic Discourse)
, and determined supports 
for staff in that focus area. In addition to the weekly 75 minute ban
ked time, teachers are supported in this area via sub out days for data meetings, 
trainings, and learning walks.
