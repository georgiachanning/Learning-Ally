By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
 
District Vision
 
It is the vision for each student to become a life
-
long learner and productive citizen, leading a fulfilled life. Included in the 
vision of the Charter is the drive to enable students to become educated citizens who will be 
literate, have problem solving 
skills, be self
-
motivated, able to utilize technology, and become socially responsible.
 
 

 
Washington's mission statement that was created and upheld by every staff member is simple. Every student will learn
 
in 
an environment in which they feel loved, safe, and respected.  All children in every classroom will learn a rigorous 

will form the fo
undation for building productive citizens of our community and the world.
 
 
We have a strong, common core standards
-
based program. Teachers utilize the thematic approach incorporating all areas 
of the curriculum in the basic theme. We use Sheltered Instruct
ion Observation Protocol (SIOP) for lesson design and 
delivery, which ensures that the English Language Learners needs are met. This method of teaching provides for 
differentiation and checking for understanding throughout the lessons. The Washington staff
 
is a highly qualified and 
enthusiastic group of professionals who are dedicated to bringing out the best qualities in our students, ourselves, and in 
the work that we do together. We are truly an organization that respects learning, honors teaching, and t
eaches for 
understanding. The staff collaborates through professional learning communities, with a focus on the academic success 
of each student embedded into every aspect of planning, organization, and use of resources

materials, fiscal and 
personnel.
 
 
In
 
1996, the staff of the Kingsburg Elementary School District, in conjunction with the citizens of the community, adopted 
a charter school compact. This allowed Washington School to become a charter school within the Kingsburg Elementary 
Charter School Dist
rict, the second in the State. Through this living document, the charter, Washington, has been able to 
adopt creative methods of educating, using researched
-
based best practices, while maintaining the traditional high 
standards expected by the Kingsburg Co
mmunity.

Today, Washington is a family of  350  (preschool
-
kindergarten) and 35 staff members with a commitment to excellence. 
The current building was constructed in 1939
-
40. The building has served as a primary school site, District offices, and now 
currently houses the Transitional Kindergarten, Kindergartners and 130 preschool students of Kingsburg. In 2010, 
Washington School became an Early Childhood School with many programs to meet the needs of students ages 3 
-
 
kindergarten. The school program i
s a modified all
-
day kindergarten schedule. With the unique grade configuration of the 
schools in our District, there is a common thread that unites the students as they transition into and out of the schools 
throughout the years.  The state preschool and 
early intervention programs are on the Washington campus making the 
transition from preschool to kindergarten an easy transition. Washington School has a kindergarten transition plan that 
all local preschools and childcare providers use in order to make tr
ansition to kindergarten informative and easy on the 
students and families. Washington School also has a two
-
year kindergarten program called Transitional Kindergarten. This 
program has been developed in line with the Kindergarten Readiness Act of 2010, SB
 
1381.  All students with fall birth 
dates will be enrolled in the transitional kindergarten program. The staff has developed strong friendships where tolerance 
is accepted and diversity is welcomed. Washington has developed a strong partnership with the c
ommunity it serves, 
where high expectations for academic standards, citizenship, community service, recreation, and traditional values are 
embraced and enveloped in the framework of a caring community.
 
 
The maintenance staff is an important part of the lea
rning community, taking pride in making this historical building a 
place where students and staff are honored to attend. Washington creates a stimulating, and aesthetically pleasing 
environment that is enjoyed by the community. Washington is proud to be a 
member of the Kingsburg Elementary 
Community Charter District.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Washington Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. Safety of 
students and staff is a primary concern of Washington Elementary School. The school is always in compliance with all laws, 
rules, and regulati
ons pertaining to hazardous materials and State earthquake standards.   At the beginning of the year, 
staff and School Site Council review the school safety plan. Key elements of the safety plan include: identifying the level 
of threat, protective options,
 
staff initial action/response, incident coordinator, and incident management team. Revisions 
are shared with the staff. Fire drills are held once a month and earthquake and lockdown drills are held yearly.
 
 
The teachers and paraprofessionals supervise stu
dents throughout the day. Parents are asked to park their cars in front 
of the school and walk their students to the cafeteria before school starts. Visitors must register at the office and receive
 
identification badges that must be displayed at all times.
 
Kingsburg Elementary Charter School District encourages 
volunteers in the classroom, field trips, and with special projects. All school volunteers in direct contact with students ar
e 
required to complete a District application form, provide evidence of a 
clear tuberculosis (TB) screening, and receive a 

Volunteers working more than 10 days per month will need to fill out additional forms
 
and submit to fingerprinting.
 
 
The Safety Plan was last reviewed with staff on August 2019.
