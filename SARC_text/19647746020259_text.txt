About 
the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

We choose our textbooks from lists that have already been approved by state education officials.
 
For a list of some of the textbooks we use at our school, 
see the Data Almanac that accompanies this report.
 
 
We have also reported additional facts about our textbooks called for by the Williams legislation of 2004. This online report
 
shows whether we ha
d a 
textbook for each student in each core course during the 2013

2014 school year and whether those textbooks covered the California Content Standards.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Originally built in 1928, Lindbergh Elementary throughout the years has been remodeled and expanded to meet the needs of the 
student population. 
The most recent expansion was completed on September 2, 2004. The expansion included the addition of a new buil
ding with 3 classrooms and a 
computer lab. All classrooms and offices are all kept in fair operating condition through the daily maintenance of our custod
ial staff and the District 
Service Center that makes repairs to the school facilities when needed.
 
 
Th
e school grounds, classrooms and restrooms are cleaned on a daily basis by our custodial staff. All staff supervise students 
throughout the day to 
assure that the entire campus is kept clean and free from litter.
 
 
For the 2011
-
2012 school year, the distric
t upgraded the first through sixth grade playground. This included the removal of playground equipment that 
did not meet current safety standard. This playground was also resurfaced to make the playground accessible to all students, 
including those with 
di
sabilities.
 
 
For the 2012
-
2013 school year, Lindbergh was repainted. Grass was planted in the play area. Trees were planted to provide students with mo
re shade. 
The playground asphalt was completely removed and replaced to repair all cracks. These repairs 
were paid for through Measure A Funds.
 
 
For the 2013
-
2014 school year, Lindbergh  received new asphalt throughout campus. These repairs were made possible through Measure K Funds
. 
Additional paving replacement of the remaining of campus were completed in D
ecember 2015. Additional fencing installation and repairs completed in 
2015. Entire school facility under Proposition 39 the lighting system were replaced with state of the art lighting and contro
ls and new energy management 
system installed for energy sav
ings of all HVAC system. Additional repairs and improvements are scheduled during 2016 to enhance play surface at 
Kindergarten area, basketball courts and field irrigation improvements.
 
 
For the 2017
-
2018 school year, Lindbergh received new 6' perimeter fe
ncing.  These repairs were made possible through Measure K funds. Three 
bungalows were removed and consolidated to create a much needed 24 space staff parking lot.  Three classrooms received new ca
rpeting in bungalows 
with severely dilapidated carpet.  New
 
asphalt replacement between K

-
2019 school year, Lindbergh received new slurry on front parking lot with new striping. Two buildings received new updat
ed fresh paint.  
Grounds keeping updating irrigation system, seeding field and grading.  Updated Parent center with new technology: 2 65" tele

carpet, cabinetry for meetings and student collaboration.  11 HVAC units were replaced by di
strict office in an effort to update/upgrade A/C units.  Mural 
was painted on Playground wall to enhance and beautify school.  Mural was completed in collaboration with community, parents,
 
district and students.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our schoo
l buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical sys
tems, heating and 
ventilation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good
 
repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make 
those repairs. The guidelines for this assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the si

accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern at Lindbergh Elementary. Administrators and teachers and sta
ff regularly monitor the campus. Students 
are supervised at all times, with campus monitors overseeing safety during lunch, recess, before and after school. After scho
ol, teachers escort their 
classes to designated pick
-
up gates for dismissal. Kindergarten
ers are released only to their parents or caregivers. The school welcomes parents and 
community members to visit the campus. However, as part of our closed campus policy, any visitors wishing to be on school gro
unds during operating 
hours must sign in at t

 
 
The school safety plan is revised every year in January by a Safe School Committee, comprised of an assortment of staff membe
rs. Revisions ar
e shared 
immediately with all members of the staff and parents. The key elements outlined within the plan include: 1) child abuse repo
rting procedures; 2) teacher 
notification of dangerous pupils procedures; 3) disaster response procedures; 4) procedures f
or safe entrance and exit from school; 5) sexual harassment 
policy: 6) suspension and expulsion policies; 7) dress code; and, 8) discipline policies. The school is in compliance with th
e laws, rules, and regulations 
pertaining to hazardous materials and st

safety during disasters. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a monthly basis throughout the school year.
