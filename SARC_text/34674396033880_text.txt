School Description
 
The mission of David Lubin Elementary School is to instill a love of scientific inquiry and application 
and to empower students to pursue a life of choices by learning in an interdisciplinary environment 
that emphasizes the strong work ethic and critical t
hinking needed to solve problems in the real 
world.
 
 
Our focus on creativity, critical thinking, communication and collaboration is essential to prepare 
students for the future.  To be effective in the 21st century, today our children must learn to create,
 
evaluate, and effectively utilize information, media, and technology.
 
 
We recognize an unprecedented opportunity to engage and include all students in the challenge 
and promise made possible through a rigorous innovative STEAM program.  As a designated ST
EAM 
school, we will establish science, technology, engineering, arts, and math as an integral part of 
learning for a future in which science belongs to all of us. Tomorrow's opportunities begin today.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The district 
instructional material evaluation committee, consisted of members representing teachers, administrators, other staff, student
s, 
parents/guardians, and community, ensures that the selected textbooks, technology
-
based materials and other educational material
s effectively support 
the district's adopted courses of study and meet current curricular goals and California Content Standards. Teachers, student
s, parents/guardians and 
community members have the opportunity to review and provide input about the instruc
tional materials being considered for adoption. 
Recommendations for the adoption and/or withdrawal of instructional materials by the instructional material evaluation commit
tee are presented to 
the Board by the Superintendent or designee and include docume
ntation supporting the recommendation. In some instances, the considered textbooks 
and/or instructional materials are piloted for a period of time before being recommended for adoption to the Board of Educati
on.

and functional.  The district Operations Department takes great pride following a work order process that provides efficient

circuit 
television (CCTV) surveillance, 3) exterior
 
painting, or 4) seal coating and striping of parking lots or playgrounds.  Fire alarms at all the district schools 
were upgraded.  Additional 10 million dollars have been allocated for safety and security upgrades, which are expected to beg
in in 2019.

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Sm
arter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligib
le students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators 
and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including ELA 
Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Ling
uistically Relevant Teaching and Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through this program deeply align with the needs of our ind
ividual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and co
nnect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson design.

n to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunity for teachers to engage
 
in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening their c
ontent knowledge, strengthening their instructional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of responsibility.
