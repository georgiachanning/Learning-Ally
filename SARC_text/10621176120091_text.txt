District Mission Statement
 
To be a quality educational system providing the resources for all students to reach their potential 
in mind, body and spirit.
 
 
District Vision Statement
 

 
 

 
As you read this School Accountability Report Card (SARC), I believe you will find that what emerges 
is a picture of a school with a commitmen
t to excellence; a faculty that is professionally skilled and 
personally committed to meeting the learning needs of all students; and a student body that, as a 
whole, is well
-
disciplined, motivated and has a great deal of pride. We are very proud that in o
ur 
18 years as a school, Freedom Elementary has earned the prestigious Clovis Unified School District 
(CUSD) Exemplary School Award 18 times, as well as the California Distinguished School Award for 
the second time and the California Gold Ribbon School Awa
rd. In addition, we earned the 
prestigious PBIS Platinum Award as well as became a Digital Citizenship certified school.
 
 
Please keep in mind that this SARC is our method of providing you with practical information 
relative to the educational programs at F
reedom Elementary School. As this method of 
communication will be used from year to year, your input and feedback is essential. Two major 
forums that are used to receive your input and feedback are the monthly School Assessment 
Review Team (SART) meetings 
and the Parent Teacher Club (PTC) meetings. You may request 
additional information regarding the SARC by calling the school at (559)

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to 
publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to pre
pare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consis
tent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardi
ans and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

January 2019. The school has focused on several areas of improvement and put strategies into place to address the concerns id
entified in our plan. In 


 
 
Although this percentage is consistent with the district average, we are not satisfied. We will continue to improve student r
esponsibility and community 
support in keeping our campus safe and clean. Our PBIS, anti
-
bullying 4 Star Trailblazer and Chara
cter Counts programs provide a sound sense of 
responsibility to students for their own actions. This, along with parent and community support, has a positive effect on cam
pus safety.

porting System for 
Categorical Aid Programs commonly called CARS. The application is submitted in two (2) parts:  Part I, which con
tains program and demographic 
information, is submitted by June 1 each year; and Part II, which contains the budget information and additional program data
, is submitted by January 
31 each year.  The categorical programs included in the application are Tit
le I, Part A 

 
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged 
Improving, Title I, Part C 

 
Migrant Education, Title II, Part A 

 
Preparing, Training and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals, and Title III 

 
Language Instruction for Limi
ted English Proficient and Immigrant Students.  Essentially, these funds are designed to assist students in mastering state 
standards.
 
 
Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community
.  CUSD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive differences in the lives of the children we all support.  We know from research tha

education will not only bring success to your child but other children 
in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending
 
on the type of categorical 
funding a site may re
ceive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and guidelines.  Such adviso
ry 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee 
(DAC) and School Advisory Committee (SAC)
 

 
District Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC)

School Plan
 

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each and every s
tudent.  Parental involvement is a necessary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall program.  At the district level, parent committees provide input into each of the 

Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP)

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://
www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
t
s, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.
 
 
District Advisory 
Committee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves as an advisory co
mmittee 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school comm
unity. They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs are supplemental education opportunit
ies that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
ri
sk.  The SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are require
d to form an ELAC. The ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding ser
vices for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall 
be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a DELAC re
presentative and arrange to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/gu
ardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) current
ly enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) elected to serve as the DELAC 

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meets 
four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achievement of our students, comm
unity agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan N
ative students in grades K 
-
 
12. The program 
assists eligible students to achieve at the same challenging state performance standards expected of all students in grades p
re
-
K 
-
12.
 
 
Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP ann
ually that works to better align the academic plan with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to 
participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participati
on of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, District Meetings and 
Community Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share 
their ideas on how CUSD 
can 
provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in the forums will

These forums are designed to provide an opportunity 

provide input and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to sha
re new ideas to support 
identified
 
groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical funding and programs in CUSD.  These funds are further discussed and outlined
 

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 
Gener

s, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economical
ly disadvantaged homes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they have a primary language other than English.  Ch
ildren, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally p
rovided through the base/core curriculum program.  The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Catego
rical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support to 
meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of high quality learning opportunities and access to the co
re curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additional 
assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom program (base/core curriculum) 
and address any learning gaps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff dev
elopment.   Staff development 
activitie
s are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other staff to challenge
 
and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
