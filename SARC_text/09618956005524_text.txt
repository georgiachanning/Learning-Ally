Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
We take 
pride in our school facility, and it is cleaned daily. Our building was built in 1959, modernized in 1997 and is of 
adequate size for our current enrollment. A regular maintenance and repair schedule is budgeted annually. The two 
classrooms, multipurpose r
oom, fields, blacktop, and playground are modern and more than adequate for our present 
student population.
 
 
The single
-
floor, wood
-
frame facility with easily accessible classroom exits is very safe in the event of fires or earthquakes. 
There are safety ru
les, fire and earthquake preparedness instruction and adequate playground supervision. A 
comprehensive safe school plan is revised and adopted annually.
 
 
In our last parent survey, 100% of the parents felt their children were safe at school and that there 
is adequate playground 
supervision and playground equipment. One hundred percent of the parents indicated that the buildings and playgrounds 
are clean, adequate and safe. An irrigated play field adds to the safety of play areas. The rest rooms, floors, wal
ls, roof, 
plumbing and electrical systems are clean, adequate, and in excellent condition. All efforts to ensure building safety, 
cleanliness, and adequacy have been successful. In the fall of 2002, new siding, painting, and water system improvements 
were 
made through various funding sources. In 2006, we developed a Community Safety Kiosk and added a 25 KW 
generator to provide the school with power during emergency incidents. The school was painted during the summer of 
2009.
 
 
The school conducted an 
energy efficiency upgrade with California Proposition 39 funds that includes new HVAC units, 
furnace, hot water eater, and lighting in the summer of 2018.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Special services provided by the school and county 
Office of Education are: special education, psychologist for testing and 
evaluation, school nurse, and an after school program.  Due to the small nature of our school all students receive 
individualized instruction on a daily basis with accommodations as n

participate a school lunch program is provided. The teacher serves as the teacher/principal/superintendent. He teaches 
full time, and performs most administrative duties before and after school hours. He sp
ends approximately 90% of his 
time teaching grades Kindergarten

professional development days per year. Three to four of these days are used to provide 
opportunities for staff to update skills and to learn about current research and trends in public education. The activities 
are determined by the staff and administrati

staff development.
