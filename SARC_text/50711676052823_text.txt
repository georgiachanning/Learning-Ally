By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.  To assist in this effort, the d
istrict 
uses a facility survey inst
rument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction.  Buildings and

addressed immediately.  An annual facilit
y safety inspection is held and reviewed by site administration. Shackelford has 
25 classrooms, a cafeteria, library, Head

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Shackelford School Safety Plan includes the following components: Introduction
-
Emergency Phone Lists, Immediate 
Action Response, Student and Parent Reunification, Maps, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, Students Speaking Out and 
Safety Hotline Informat

and Social Environments. The plan is reviewed annually by staff and Safety Committee members, and Safety Committee 
meetings are held two times per year. S
tudent safety is a priority at Shackelford School. Safety begins with adequate adult 
supervision. Teachers and staff are responsible for student safety each day before school, during recess periods, and after 
school. In addition, the Administrator of Pupil
 
and Staff Services, K6, custodians, and yard duty staff monitor school 
entrances and hallways before, during and after school. Six part
-
time crowd control/noon duty supervisors have been 
hired to supervise noon recess activities and recess. One part
-
time 
adult supervisor serves as a crossing guard before and 
after school. To ensure that students are safe throughout the day, a variety of safety procedures have been established. 
A comprehensive School Safety Plan that describes these procedures has been deve
loped and is evaluated regularly by 
the site Safety Committee. Safety procedures are in place to monitor adults entering the campus. All gates to the campus 
are locked during school hours except the main gate located near the main office. This main gate is
 
to remain closed at all 
times for safety. All adults who enter the school must register in the school office and wear a visitor badge including 
substitute teachers. Signs are present at entry points to notify parents and adults of this requirement. Safety
 
/lockdown 
drills and fire drills occur regularly to provide on
-
going training in the event of an emergency.

Professional development in MCS is data driven using research
-
based best practices to ensure our students receive 
guaranteed and viable curriculum in every grade, in every school.    We use formative and summative data to drive our 
instructional decisions 
and focus for professional development.  To this end, we utilize multiple structures  to provide 
high
-
quality professional development to our staff including:  summer training, preservice
-
days, district wide professional 
development days, after school work
shops, Saturday workshops, substitute
-
release days, instructional coaching, a BTSA 
and PAR program,  and most recently a 0.5% compensation package for those who choose to complete an extra 6 hours 
of professional development.
 
 
MCS has prioritized our focus
 
on mathematics, literacy across grades and content areas, collaboration, welcoming 
schools/customer service, and building our capacity as professionals.  This has been in addition to the needed training in 
new adoptions, curriculum and standard updates an
d the like.  The professional development is sustained through site 
administration, district and site level instructional coaches, and intervention specialists.  In the 2019
-
202 academic year, 
a new division was also created in order to increase the qualit
y and quantity of professional development provided to 
classified, certificated, and managers alike.
