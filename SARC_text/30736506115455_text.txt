By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Canyon View School serves the children of Northwood Pointe, a residential area in the northernmo
st part of Irvine. Many 
of the residents have moved to this community from other areas of the city, and there is a high percentage of parents in 
professional occupations. There is a strong interest among our parents and our staff to provide a neighborhood 
school 
that is a primary focus of community activity. The partnership between the school, families, and community is the 
backbone of our success, and we are committed to maintaining and strengthening our high level of family engagement.  
We have a diverse 
community, and while English speaking students make up the majority of the student population, we 
have a number of students who represent a variety of ethnic backgrounds and speak many languages. Currently 28% of 
our student population is considered EL, an
d there are more than 26 identified languages spoken by our families. Canyon 

 
 
Canyon View has been fortunate in gathering a very competent, dedicated staff that is committed to
 
creating a caring, 
learning community and an educational program for the 21st century. With the partnership of our students and parents, 
we work to accomplish the primary mission of Canyon View, which is "high levels of learning for all." We are proud to 
be 
a high performing school with an outstanding educational program.  Our students consistently outperform the average 
for both Orange County and the state of California on English Language Arts and math state assessments, and our 
community recognizes that
 
our teachers support high levels of learning for all students.  Our school utilizes a Multi
-
Tiered 
System of Supports, which allows us to address the needs of all students through high quality instruction, interventions, 
and enrichment.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Canyon View enjoys a state
-
of
-
the
-
art school facility to support its educational program.  Completed in 2000, 
the school 
was the first in Irvine to include infrastructure to support technology
-
based teaching and learning.  We continue to update 
our technology yearly with a current emphasis on providing Chromebook Carts and iPad carts for classroom use.  An 
Informa
tion Resource Center (IRC) serves as an electronic hub for the school, providing information access and 
communication throughout the building, community and world.  The facility includes science, art and music specialist 
rooms, in addition to classrooms fo
r special education class use.  The multi
-
purpose room functions as a large theatre, 
with a raised stage and sound system that facilitate integration of the performing arts with other curricular areas. There 
is a safety alarm system that is supported by a 
modern, multi
-
option phone system. A lift provides access to the multi
-
purpose stage area for the handicapped. T
-
line connections and a LAN with a fiber optic spine ensure timely exchange of 
information. In summer, 2018, our seven modular units adjacent to
 
the permanent facility were replaced by permanent 
building with eight classrooms.  This building is fully air conditioned, offers full internet access to students and provide 
an 
attractive learning environment for our students.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

success is the high degree of parent involvement in every aspect of their child's school life.  
Hundreds of moms, dads, and other relatives volunteer in classrooms, participate in School Site Council and PTA activities, 
and enrich school life through servi
ce on nearly 40 special committees.  The Canyon View parent community significantly 
augments school programs and services through fundraising. They provide richly enhanced curricular materials and 
programs, conduct legislative action activities, and suppor
t the Irvine Public Schools Foundation. Decision making is shared 
among parents and staff in the School Site Council and PTA Board as well as through a variety of volunteer leadership 
opportunities open to parents. In addition to the enormous role parent v
olunteers play in our communication system, 
parents are given leadership roles for curriculum and enrichment support in the following ways:
 
 
Art Masters:  The PTA supplements our district art program by providing Art Masters.  Primary students receive five
 
lessons 
per year and upper grade students receive three lessons.  This enrichment program offers art lessons to all students based 
on the works of famous artists.
 
 
Book Fairs: Book fairs are organized by parent volunteers not only promote reading, but wri
ting as well.
 
 
100 Mile Club: Parents coordinate Running Club at Canyon View.  Students run and we keep track of their mileage. They 
earn awards and medals. The school also encourages the Canyon View community to sign up for local runs in the 
community and
 
fun runs on campus before and after school.
 
 
Other: Parents are encouraged to serve as classroom volunteers, and to participate in many other school wide events such 
as the Family Fun Night and Taste of Canyon View.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our students and staff will continue to be safe in the event of a crisis. The School Safety
 
Committee has created a 
comprehensive Safe School Plan that includes clearly defined emergency procedures, and this plan is updated annually. 
Staff members are trained in CPR and Medic First Aid, and the school regularly practices safe school procedures, 
including 
fire drills, duck and cover drills, unauthorized person/lock
-
down procedures, reunification drills, and full earthquake 

assists in an
nually replenishing needed equipment and water supplies. The School/PTA Safety Committee addresses all 
safety considerations at school. Teachers also help to monitor the schools grounds 15 minutes before and after school.  In 
addition, primary teachers wal
k their class to the front of the school at dismissal to help ensure student safety.  
Collaboration with the Irvine Police Department and the Irvine Traffic Department has facilitated a more safe and efficient 
traffic route to school. They have also helped
 
numerous times to facilitate more effective and safe parking at and around 
Canyon View School. The most recent Maintenance and Operations School Site Inspection Report, indicated that Canyon 



 
 
Canyon View is a place where students follow school expectations. Through our Positive Behavior Intervention Supports 
(PBIS) System, staff develop and maintain programs to support stud

Multiple
-
Tier System of Supports (MTSS) staff support the learning of all students based on their individual needs 
--
 
both 
academic and behavioral.  This proactive approach to supporting student behaviors has
 
resulted in a decrease in 
suspensions and an increase in the number of students who report positive interactions with others at school.  In the 
2018
-
2019 school year, there were no formal suspensions and no expulsions. Our students attend school regularly
; the 
average daily attendance for the 2018
-
2019 school year was 93.56%.  No students were taken to the School Attendance 
Review Board (SARB). One hundred percent of 6th grade students participate in the DARE program, and the Great Body 
Shop health curricu
lum is used at all grade levels to educate students about health, nutrition, safety and the dangers of 
drug use.

wide goals for improving student achievement include efforts to bring our instruction into alignment 
with the CA Common Core Standards to ensure the development of the essential capacities. The essential capa
cities are 
knowledge, communication, problem solving, and relationship/interpersonal skills. This will be measured by accessing and 
navigating large quantities of information and evaluating the validity and relevancy of this information. Educators will 
col
laborate to determine what students must learn, gather evidence of the learning by examining both formative and 
summative assessment data, and use the evidence to better meet the needs of students through systematic instruction 
and enrichment. Areas of foc
us will be to investigate best practices for data driven decision making. In addition, we will 
research, develop and utilize progress monitoring tools for tier 2 and tier 3 interventions. Our goals include:
 

 
Intellectual Risk Taking and Growth
-
Mindset
-
 
To e
ncourage intellectual risk taking, the admission of error as a 
central part of the learning process for students and staff, and foster self
-
reflection for students and staff.
 

 
The Learning Cycle and Professional Learning Communities 
-
 
Teams will be engaging
 
in The Learning Cycle in 
order to unpack standards, develop learning targets, analyze common assessments and determine next steps. 
Teams will analyze evidence of student learning in order to make decisions about how best to meet students 
needs.
 

 
Technology
 
Integration 
-
 
"Effective integration of technology is achieved when students are able to select 
technology tools to help them obtain information in a timely manner, analyze and synthesize the information, 
and present it professionally. The technology shou
ld become an integral part of how the classroom functions 
-
-
 
as accessible as all other classroom tools." 

 
National Educational Technology Standards for Students, 
International Society for Technology in Education.
 

 
MTSS: PLC Teams will unpack standards, 
design learning targets, develop common assessments, and analyze 
student work/data in order to improve teaching and learning. Teams will implement 
strategies/interventions/extensions and collaborate with MTSS team to improve student outcomes.
 
 
Common Core 
Curricular Area Focal Points:
 

 
Math: Teams will align CCSS Math standards & mathematical practices with curriculum, instruction, and 
assessments. Teams will begin to support students in shifting from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset in math.
 

 
Writing: Tea
ms will align NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards), curriculum, instruction and assessments.
 
Another area of focus will be to continue the Positive Behavior Interventions and Support (PBIS) system which will enable 
students to achieve academic, behavio
r, and social success. The staff will continue to receive training in PBIS with the 
mission to have an overall positive school climate and improve the academic culture through increased instructional time 
by identifying, teaching, and reinforcing the expec
ted behaviors.
