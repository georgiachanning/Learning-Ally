About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional in
formation about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Condit Elementary School are currently being aligned to
 
the California State Standards.  Instructional materials 
are selected from the state's most recent list of standards
-
based materials and adopted by the State Board of Education. The district follows the State 
Board of Education's adoption cycle for core c
ontent materials (English language arts, math, science, and social science).
 
 
On Thursday, October 17, 2019, the Claremont Unified School District's Board of Education held a public hearing to certify th
e extent to which textbooks 
and instructional materia
ls have been provided to students. The Board of Education adopted Resolution #06
-
2020 which certifies as required by Education 
Code ยง60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional;materials were provided to all students, including English learners, in the 
dist
rict to the extent that 
each pupil has a textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient textbooks
 
and instructional materials 
were provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to
 
the academic content standards and consistent with the cycles and content 
of the curriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English language arts.
 
in addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARC
s the sufficiency of instructional materials used for their visual/performing 
arts curricula. During the 2018
-
19 school year, Claremont Unified School District provided each student, including English learners, enrolled in a 
visual/performing arts class wi
th a textbook or instructional materials to use in class and to take home. These materials complied with the state's content 
standards and curriculum frameworks.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district takes great efforts to 
ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional through proper facilities & maintenance and campus supervision. 
Condit Elementary School's original facilities were built in 1959; ongoing maintenance and campus improvements ensure facilit
ies remain 
up to date and 
provide adequate space for students and staff.District maintenance and site custodial staff ensure that the repairs necessary
 
to keep the school in good 
condition are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used by school and d
istrict staff to communicate non
-
routine maintenance requests. 
Emergency repairs are given the highest priority..
 
 
Every morning before school begins, the custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards or other conditions that need attent
ion prior to stu
dents and staff 
entering school grounds. One day custodian and two evening custodians (one full
-
time and one part
-
time) are assigned to Condit Elementary School. The 
day custodian is responsible for:
 

 
Cafeteria setup/cleanup
 

 
Restroom cleaning
 

 
Trash removal
 
 
 
Restrooms are checked throughout the day for cleanliness and subsequently cleaned as needed. The evening custodians are respo
nsible for:
 

 
Classroom cleaning
 

 
Common use area cleaning
 

 
Office area cleaning
 

 
Restroom cleaning
 
 
 
The principal communicates with 
custodial staff daily concerning maintenance and school safety issues.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priorit

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
