Reported Using Data from the 2018

19 School Year
 
Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
DISASTER PLAN
 
I.  PURPOSE
 
This plan is designed to provide a framework for the responses to be taken by school staff for protecting students, staff, 
and 
school facilities from a wide range of emergency and disaster situations which may occur.  Such situations include, 
but are not limited to, fire, earthquake, flood, bomb threat, and hazardous material spills.  In the event of a widespread 
disaster such as 
an earthquake, it is recognized that available government resources will be overtaxed and may be unable 
to respond to all requests for assistance.  Therefore, this plan assumes that the school must be self
-
sufficient for a time 
and may be asked to provide 
shelter to the immediate community by Fire District, Red Cross or community 
representatives.

IV.  EMERGENCY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
 
A.  Authority to Implement Plan   This plan will be implemented by the principal or her/his designee when conditions exist 
which warrant its execution.
 
Disaster Plan (continued)
 
B.  Structure and Organ
ization  Emergency and disaster functions have been identified and pre
-
assigned by the principal,    
including two
-
deep backup.  (Appendix E)  Checklists have been developed which enumerate priority actions to be taken 
for each disaster assignment.  (Appen
dix F)  These checklists are maintained in the mobile disaster file.
 
C.  Alert and Warning  Alert and warning systems include the following:
 
Flood/tsunami warnings will come from the Fire Department by siren, phone call, and/or fax.
 
Fire warning 
-
 
Automati
c smoke and heat detectors will activate the school fire alarm, providing intermittent blasts for 3
-
5 minutes.
 
Evacuation 
-
 
Depending upon the situation and the amount of warning provided, the school fire alarm will be activated, 
or an 
announcement will be make over the bullhorn, or runners will be used.
 
Communications  Telephones will only be used to report emergency conditions or to request emergency assistance.  If 
phone service is interrupted, a two
-
way radio or runners will be utili
zed to communicate between the district office and 
either the Bolinas Fire Department (100 Mesa Road) or the Stinson Beach Fire Department (State Route #1) as necessary.  
A bull horn   and/or runners will be used within the school buildings and on school g
rounds.  A transistor radio will be used 
to receive information of local conditions.
 
Evacuation  Evacuation of the school buildings will be ordered by the principal.  Teachers will insure that all students have
 
left the classroom; will direct student evacu
ation via designated routes; and will take their roll book.  Students and staff 
will assemble by class near the basketball blacktop and roll will be taken.  Further instructions will be issued by the 
principal.   In the event that the school site is ordere
d evacuated by the principal in coordination with  public safety officials, 
students and staff will proceed on foot as follows:
 
From Stinson site, go to Stinson Community Center
 
From Bolinas site, go to Bolinas Community Center

A notice indicating where st
udents and staff have gone will be posted on the school office door.  It is assumed that, due 
to limited access routes caused by damaged roads, school buses or automobiles of staff or parents will not be available to 
transport students or to transfer them 
to an alternate shelter site following most disasters.  In the event that the Stinson 
Beach and Bolinas community Centers cannot be used for shelter, the following procedure will be used:  Previously 
designated alternative shelters will be used at the Fire
 

 
F.  Disaster File  A mobile disaster file will be maintained in the school office and will be removed by the secretary whenev
er 
the school building is evacuated.   (Appendix D)
 
G.  Student Release and School Closure Release of students
 
may be advised by public safety staff or person authorized by 
the principal whenever a condition exists warranting such action, i.e., earthquake, flood, severe winter storm, etc.   
Students must be picked up and signed out by a parent or an authorized rep
resentative of the parent.  Students who are 
not picked up or who are unable to proceed home will be kept at the school or at the school
-
designated alternative shelter.  
When the decision has been made to release students, local Fire Departments will be no
tified by phone or other available 
means.  They will, in turn, notify the County Emergency Communication Center.  School closure and re
-
opening will also 
be reported to radio stations:  KCBS (740 AM) (415) 765
-
4074,  KGO (810 AM) (415) 362
-
4809, and/or  KS
RO (1350 AM) 
(707)545
-
1000.    Parents will be advised of release criteria and procedures, in writing, at the beginning of each school 
year.
 
H.  Teacher Buddy System  Teachers in adjacent classrooms have been pre
-
assigned responsibility for each other.  If
 
one 
of the teachers must remain with injured student or must assume other disaster responsibilities, the other teacher will 
evacuate and supervise both classes of students.
 
I.  Status Reports  As soon as possible following a disaster, the principal will s
ubmit a status report to the Bolinas and 
Stinson Beach Fire Chiefs.  Updated reports will be issued as the situation warrants.   (Forms D)
 
J.  Shelter  The School is prepared to shelter students and staff for a limited period of time following a disaster. 
 
If long
-
term shelter arrangements are required, the Red Cross will be notified and will provide additional shelter, staff and 
supplies.
