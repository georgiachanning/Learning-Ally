School Description
 
Valencia Elementary School is located in an established neighborhood in the most northern part of 
Upland, California.   Currently there are 24 classrooms of students in transitional kindergarten 
through sixth grade, and two specialized academic instruction
 
classrooms for students in grades 
first through sixth.  The school community is very supportive, both through PTA and a large group 
of dedicated parent volunteers.  The staff is committed to their students and strives to move all 
students towards the prof
iciency of standards, challenge advanced students, develop a 
Professional Learning Community and explore ways to support students through Multi
-
tiered 
System of Support and Universal Design for Learning.  Resources have been aligned to support 
student achi
evement and staff development activities are numerous. Valencia Elementary School 
welcomes approximately 620 students from a variety of backgrounds. Our culturally diverse 
population consists of 12% Asian, 3% African
-
American, 31% Hispanic or Latino, and 5
0% Caucasian.
 
 

Our goal is that all students will acquire and apply knowledge in preparation for college and career. 
Student achievement results will 
show mastery of standards by individual students as well as by 
student sub
-
groups.   It is Valencia's goal to educate students to reach their highest potential, 
thereby ensuring a successful future.  Valencia Elementary School is dedicated to promoting 
aca
demic achievement and positive social behavior by creating a safe, nurturing community of

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to pub
lish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepar
e a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consisten
t with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information a
bout the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school princip
al or the 
district office.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Parents are an integral part of the learning success of all students at Valencia. On the first day of school, parents are pro
vided with a volunteer survey 
listing numerous opportunities 
to assist at school. At Back to School Night and Transitional Kindergarten/Kindergarten Orientation, parents are given a 
personal invitation and explanation of how they can participate. In the fall, room parents and grade level copy parents are i
nvited to 
attend the Parent 
Volunteer Orientation. Community members are seen often on campus fulfilling a variety of roles, such as tutors, library help
ers, PTA committee 
members, book fair volunteers, clerical assistants, field trip chaperones, vision and hearing 
and height and weight test supporters, Talent Show 
volunteers, Mileage Club volunteers, and Watch DOGS (Dads of Great Students). PTA sponsors a variety of school
-
promoted family activities such as the 
Fall Social, regular Take Your Family to Dinner Nights,
 
Kindergarten Reading Night,  and two Book Fairs which parents are encouraged to participate in.  
Additionally, grade level teams often incorporate activities, involving parents and the community, that bring the curriculum 
to life. Valencia's School Site 
C
ouncil and English Language Acquisition Committee also provide opportunities for parents to be involved in the decision
-
making process.  Various 
evening meetings are scheduled throughout to provide parents with additional information regarding our school a
nd related services, such as a Welcome 
Back Parents and Educational Technology information meetings.

School Safety Plan
 
Valencia Elementary School maintains a Comprehensive School Safety Plan. Our site safety representative, in conjunction with 
our safety committee, 
updates our School Safety Plan annually
 
and provides ongoing safety training and information at staff meetings. Our most recent revision was completed 
in September 2018.  At the beginning of each school year, parents and staff are provided with a digital handbook that contain
s school policies, 
emergency 
procedures and a school
-
wide safety plan. The Plan covers all contingencies for smog, earthquake, fire, lockdown and other State Emergency 
Management System requirements. All classrooms have tubs with individual student emergency food bags and su
pplies as well as other supplies in case 
of  an emergency. The Valencia PTA maintains classroom first
-
aid backpacks. Fire extinguishers and disaster protocols are clearly visible in each classroom. 
Valencia has created and maintains an emergency shed which
 
contains items to be used in a crisis.  School
-
wide disaster, fire, lockdown, and barricade 
drills are practiced on a monthly basis. Our School Safety Plan helps to ensure that students and staff feel safe and prepare
d.  The Upland Fire Department 
trained
 
staff on the use of the emergency flag system that is used is city
-
wide in the event of an emergency.  A team comprised of site and district 
administrators along with teachers and the Upland Police department school resource officer are working together t
o develop a protocol for active 
shooter situations.  To increase student safety and security before and after school, Valencia has installed a new coded syst
em on the gates giving parents 
access to school grounds for Daycare purposes. It is our main goal t
o maintain student and staff safety in all emergency situations.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The Upland Unified School District believes that high quality, research
-
based professional development is essential to continuous improvement of 
teaching skills and concepts. The District provides or coordinates on
-
going training based on needs identified 
through student performance indicators, 
including results of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, the English Language Proficiency Assessme
nts for California, District 
iReady benchmark assessments, and input from sites regarding s
pecific needs. Professional development is aligned with the District Strategic Plan for 
Student Achievement and Board goals. Teachers, paraprofessionals and administrators participate in workshops, and conferences
 
that allow them to 
grow professionally and
 
provide opportunities for collegial sharing. Regular meetings of teacher leaders in literacy, mathematics, reading interventi
on 
and technology as well as follow
-
up coaching support full implementation of training. Additionally, each school provides time f
or teacher collaboration 
on student achievement data, curriculum development, and review of classroom
-
based performance measures. Examples of workshops and coaching 
implemented as the result of analysis of student achievement include: Effective Teaching St
rategies, Classroom Management, Curriculum Alignment and 
Mapping, English Language Development, AVID, Thinking Maps, Positive Behavior Intervention Support, Social Emotional Learning
, 21st Century 
Classroom Technology, Common Core State Standards, Next Gen
eration Science Standards, Modeling Academic Language, Universal Design for Learning, 
and Parent Engagement. Staff members participate in professional development in all
-
day workshops, after
-
school workshops and meetings, individual 
coaching/mentoring, and
 
off
-
site conferences. The Induction (formerly BTSA) program provides support to new teachers. The Peer Assistance and Review 
Program is available to provide support to teachers in the areas of content knowledge and teaching strategies. Currently, the
 
Dist
rict calendar includes a 
collaboration day schedule each week to allow for on
-
going teacher dialogue and collaboration to meet student needs.
