Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Waterloo Middle School is in the Linden Unified School District; a medium
-
sized rural district, in the Eastern agricultural 
belt of San Joaquin County, serving approximately 2,300 students in grades K
-
12.  Waterloo
 
Middle School is a fifth grade 
through eighth grade middle school with an enrollment of 364 students.  The Waterloo staff consists of 17 credentialed 
classroom teachers, 1 computer lab instructor/librarian, 7 Resource and English Language Learner instruct
ional aides, 2 
school secretaries, 3 maintenance/custodians, and 1 site administrator.  Waterloo Middle School offers an after school, 
extended learning program, which is funded by a state grant.  A homework club is also offered three days a week after 
sch
ool to support all students' instructional needs. Three days a week there is also a targeted language acquisition class 
for our ELL population.
 
 
Waterloo Middle School is currently operating as a Title 1 school. Students come from diverse home situations i
ncluding 
but not limited to: migrant, mobile home parks, single family homes, and farm worker housing.
 
56.8% of the student population is eligible to receive free and reduced
-
price lunch.
 
 
The diverse student enrollment at Waterloo is made up of 58.8% Hisp
anic, 37.7% White, and other ethnicities. 18.6% of 
the student population has been identified as English Learners. Spanish is the home language of the majority of the 
students identified as English Learners.
 
 
Our Parent Teacher Club is active year round an
d has made a significant impact, improving the education of our students, 
both in the classroom and on the playground. PTC meets monthly and meetings are well attended by parents and school 
staff. Parent's volunteer on a weekly basis and host student and f
amily events during the academic year. We also have an 
English Language Advisory Committee that meets during the school year, so that all stack holders have a voice in decisions 
made in our school community.
 
 
The vision of the Waterloo School Community is 
to provide an environment characterized by high academic standards, a 
positive attitude, respect for diversity and a belief that each person is valued as a unique individual.  Students are 
supported in this environment by family, staff and community involv
ement. Students, family and staff will be stimulated 
to learn through a wide variety of activities and strategies that address the needs of all learners. Students will be instill
ed 
with self discipline and a positive attitude toward lifelong learning.  Stu
dents will graduate feeling empowered to reach 
their full potential as responsible, well rounded members of society.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Waterloo school has a well developed School Safety Plan that is reviewed and updated annually.  As a staff we review all 
safety procedures and update the supplies and information in the safety binders at the beginning of the school year.  Staff 
and student
s participate in simulated drills of all the action plans in the School Safety Plan.  Students are closely supervised 
by staff before, during and after school.  The site is well maintained and safety concerns are reported to the office and are
 
addressed by
 
the district maintenance crew, site custodians and/or the site administration. The Morada Fire Department 
does a yearly evaluation our of facility to make sure that we are in compliance with fire safety guidelines.

This section provides information on the annual number of 
school days dedicated to staff development for the most recent 
three
-
year period.
 
 
During 2017
-
2018 school year, the district Professional Development for teachers has focused on Next Generation Science 
Standards.  There are three full training days with c
ounty guided science experts.  Teachers then work in grade level 
groupings to further prepare the science materials for classroom instruction.  In addition, many of the early release 
Wednesdays during the school year have also been devoted to continued tra
ining with the NGSS.   The district has also 
established a Science Cadre in which designated grade level teachers (voluntary) were trained to assist their grade level 
in deeper understanding of NGSS and their implementation.   Also, during the summer prece
ding this school year, the 
district invited teachers to meet by grade level with a trainer from the publisher of our new math curriculum.  The purpose 
of the week long session was to create a usable, consistent pacing guide for mathematics instruction by g
rade level.
 
 
The district has also hired two instructional coaches.  One is focused on ELA and ELD instructional strategies while the 
other is focused on mathematics instruction and utilizing technology in the classroom.  They are functioning to do distric
t 
or site training as well as working with individual teachers in the classroom.  These coaches are funded through Title I 
categorical funds.
 
 
Instructional aides are provided training both from outside sources (usually county office of education opportuni
ties) as 
well as individual one
-
on
-
one training to be sure they possess skills and strategies for teaching literacy.  Custodial and 
Maintenance staff have received a full day of training in strategies related to their positions.  The secretarial staff rece
ives 
annual training in areas affecting the current legal requirements they must know to perform their jobs accurately.
 
 
At Waterloo, additional training opportunities for teachers and aides outside of the regular school day are available on 
occasion.  Som
e of this training includes English Language Development, SBAC Assessment training, Technology, AVID, 
NGSS, etc.  During site PD days, the staff is learning a variety of student engagement strategies this school year.
