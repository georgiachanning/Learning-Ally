About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All curriculum development at Laguna Beach Unified School D
istrict adheres to the California State Content Standards and Frameworks. Teachers align 
classroom curriculum to ensure that all students either meet or exceed state proficiency levels. Using student data from mult
iple assessments, 
administrators and teach
ers look at how well students are performing according to state grade level standards, identifying areas of strength and 

um Council
 
provides 
guidance and input to ensure the educational program meets the needs of all students. The Curriculum Council, comprised of re
presentatives from 
schools, the District, and parents, oversees curriculum policy and maintains a continuum of instructio
nal programs across all grade levels. All students, 
including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to check out and take home or to access via 
their personal device at home and at school. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the 
District are aligned with the California State Content Standards and Frameworks. The Curriculum Council establishes selection
 
criteria based on state 
sta
ndards, reviews instructional materials on the state list, and makes recommendations to the Board of Education for final appr
oval.
 
 
Laguna Beach Unified School District sets a high priority upon ensuring that sufficient and current textbooks and materials 
are available to support our 

ned that each school 
within the District has sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional mate
rials, or science lab equipment, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. 
the State of California.
 
 
All textbooks are in adequate supply and in excellent to good condition.  The school and district place great emphasis on pro
viding students with the 
most
 
up

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
