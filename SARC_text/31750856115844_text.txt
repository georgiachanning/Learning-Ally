About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The school is a beautiful facility, which opened in 1999.   It is a clean, well cared for campus that provides an exemplary e
nvironment for student learning. 
It is a school of which stu
dents, staff, and parents can be proud. It has become a hub for students and community members. Our facilities are used every
 
afternoon and evening.  Sports and recreation activities, clubs and other local organizations regularly utilize the campus. T
hese 
activities enrich the lives 
of the community members and the school population.
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.  To assist in this effort, the d
istrict uses a facility survey instrument 
develope
d by the State of California Office of Public School Construction.  District maintenance ensures that the repairs necessary t
o keep the school 
sites in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure 
efficient service and that emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority.
