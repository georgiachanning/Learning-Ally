By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or
 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
pr
incipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The District makes 
every effort to ensure all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the district uses 
a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of this 
survey are available
 
at the school office and at the district office.
 
 
The building in which Renaissance resides was built in 1962. School facilities are being renovated according to the Field 
Act requirements of the State Building Code with a focus on earthquake safety. In t
he event that asbestos and lead 
containing building materials are found, they are removed according to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), State, 
and Local requirements. Deferred maintenance funds have been used to properly maintain and renovate distric
t buildings. 
Needed repairs and maintenance projects are completed in a timely manner.
 
 
Whenever possible, school facilities are upgraded to support and maintain a safe, clean and secure campus. Sufficient 
classroom, office, library, playground, staff

with day and night custodians, ensure the school buildin
gs and grounds are safe, clean, and in good repair. Rigorous daily 
custodial schedules ensure that classrooms, lavatories, serving kitchens, eating areas, offices, and playgrounds are clean 
for both student and staff use. Regular oversight by district main
tenance and grounds crews ensure that grass and

students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the re
quirements for entrance to

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Renaissance community works hard to ensure all students are safe. Renaissance has a very detailed, comprehensive 
safety plan that 
outlines protocols, systems, and procedures in the event of any/all emergencies. The plan also contains 
the yearly safety goals as determined by the students, staff, and parents. The Safety Plan is developed by the Renaissance 
Safety Committee, presented t
o the School Site Council and then sent to the Alum Rock School District Board of Trustees 
for approval. The revised plan was last approved in December 2019. The Safety Plan and drill procedures are reviewed 
during the year with all staff. Safety alerts ar
e shared with all staff as needed throughout the school year. In addition, all 
required drills are calendared and completed, and the results are shared with the staff. When guests are visiting 
Renaissance they first check in at the office and are required 
to wear a visitor pass while spending time on campus. The 
Renaissance staff follows a yard
-
duty schedule to ensure that students are well supervised before school, during brunch, 
during lunch, and at dismissal. The Renaissance Safety Plan has a comprehensi
ve, enforceable, continuous behavior policy, 
rules and regulations, dress code policy, protocols for safety/emergency drills, tardy policy, attendance policy, referral 
policy, and nondiscriminatory policy on student rights and responsibilities. The Safety 
Plan is revised bi
-
annually.
