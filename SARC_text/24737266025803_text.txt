Welcome to the Merced River School District: Home of the Patriots! The Merced River School 
District is a rural Transitional 
Kindergarten through the 8th
-
grade school district. We are comprised 
of a TK/K combo class and one class per grade level for grades 1st 
-
 
8th.  Our class size average is 
approximately 20 students per teacher.  We also have a Resource Specialist teacher who
 
provides 
both "push
-
in and pull
-
out" services to best support our students.  We have 5 1/2 instructional 
aides with one assigned per grade level to each teacher. The aides help students in small groups, 
one to one, or on a needed basis. The district provi
des transportation to and from school every day. 
We are very proud that our cafeteria staff continues to provide all students with a nutritional menu 
with a variety of choices for lunch.
 
 
The Merced River School District continues to strive towards success
 
for our students, school, and 
community.  The district has continued to increase in its enrollment numbers these past years and 
has hit one of its highest enrollment numbers in years at 203.  The increase in enrollment is 
attributed to the programs, small
 
school setting, and especially the relationships we have 
developed with our parents and stakeholders these past years.  For the coming year, the district 
looks to possibly add
-
on additional portables to support a true Transitional Kindergarten/Early 
Educa
tion Program and possibly bring back our school library.
 
 
The Merced River School District also saw a change in the makeup of the school board once again 
this year. The Merced River School District had a vacancy on the board due to a trustee 
resigning.  
The district went through the appointment process and selected Abraham Aguilar as a trustee for 
the remaining term of the resigning trustee. He will work alongside our other trustees to carry out 
the vision of the district and keep the district
 
fiscally solvent for many years to come.
 
 
In 2019
-
2020, the district continued to implement the Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support or MTSS in 

programs that we 
offer. The staff began the Tier 2 of Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports 
(PBIS) and will continue to  PBIS implementation the goal for the coming year. The MTSS and PBIS 

e outlying years.
 
 
Our academic programs are centered on providing students with the rigor needed to succeed. This 

Department to form a Merced River School Dist
rict Cabinet team. Working collaboratively with the 
county team has helped us better support students and teachers as we continue down the road to 
address achievement gaps and increase services for all students. This year the school integrated 
the Next Gen
eration Science Standards program and will pilot additional ones to find the best one 
for our students. Our 6th
-
8th will continue to participate in the Battle of the Books and the 
Academic Pentathlon once again this year. Additionally, the district is comm
itted to providing all 
students with the technology tools/devices needed to carry
-
out our curricular programs and has 
set aside funds to update our infrastructure as technology implementation continues.

(continu
ed)
 
Our district continually updates the Local Control A
ccountability 
Plan (LCAP) with all stakeholder input in order to improve 
outcomes for all students, especially our English Language 
Learners, Foster Youth, and Low
-
Socioeconomic populations. Each 
year following, we have modified the Actions/Services in the
 
LCAP 
in order to set new ones to help us achieve our goals. Our 3 Local 
Goals with Expected Annual Outcomes and Actions and Services 
include: 1) Assure that all students will be provided with access to 
State Standard curriculum and materials, 2) Raise Rea
ding and 
Math scores for all students, including English Learners, and 3) 
Prepare students to be High School, College, Trade School or Career 
ready. We will partner with families to ensure that all students are 
ready for their high school transition. Our d
istrict meets with our 
stakeholders to review the LCAP processes and receive their input 
as to how the district can best meet the needs of our students and 
help them achieve. One can access our LCAP Plan by visiting our 
website at www.mrsd.us. The Californ
ia Dashboard, the state's 
accountability system, demonstrates to our stakeholders that our 
students are maintaining progress in the academic areas with a 
score of "Yellow." Our teachers and staff are committed to 
ensuring that we continue to provide all st
udents with the best 
education possible to help them all reach the "Green or Blue" 
status on the Dashboard.
 
 
As the superintendent of the Merced River School, I remain 
committed to the success of all students and finding the resources 
to help each student 
improve. On behalf of the Merced River 
School District, the School Board, and the Teachers and Staff, we 
thank you for giving us the opportunity to be a part of your 

-
rounded educational 

her successful year and we look to bigger 
and better things for the coming year.
 
 
Merced River School District's Vision Statement:
 
It is the vision of the Merced River School Staff to educate their 
students to be functional, literate, contributing members 
to society 
at large.
 
 
Merced River School District's Mission Statement:
 
The Merced River School District will develop STARS by equipping 
students with the tools to be Safe, Trustworthy, Accountable, 
Respectful and Successful citizens. This will be accompli
shed by 
providing high
-
quality instruction and building meaningful 
relationships in a positive school
-
wide environment.
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card 
(SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan
 
(LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For m
ore information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF w

year cycle from the State
-
approved lists. Prior to adoption, materials are made available 
for public review for 30 days.
 
The staff is also given ample opportunity to work with a variety of textbooks to make their final recommendations. Once 
reviewed, the local Board of Trustees makes the final decision to approve the textbook adoption based on the recommendation o
f the staf
f and

encouraged to share and try new things and new programs may be piloted with administrative approval.
 
 
W
ith the integration of technology in education, our district is committed to ensuring that all of our students have access to
 
the various curricula and 
other online educational support programs online.  All of our 4th
-
8th grade students have Chromebooks as
signed to them.  The 6th
-
8th grade students 
use an online Language Arts program. All of our students have their own books for use in class and to take home. The District
 
has assured that all students 
have access and possess their own textbooks in all subje
ct areas. In addition to this, the district purchases all consumables and intervention materials for 
each student and quite often also purchases basic school supplies for all.  All of our TK
-
3rd grade students have access to iPads in order to access other 
school districts provided online programs. The district is committed to providing all students with access to technology to f
urther deepen student learning.
 
 
We verify textbook adoption yearly and at this time are in the process of piloting new textbooks f
or the Next Generation Science Standards as well as 
supplemental materials for the English Language Arts/English Language Development and Math. The district launched an Engineer
ing is Elementary 
curriculum to familiarize teachers and students with engineer
ing fundamentals. The district will continue to pilot curriculum materials in order to 
purchase the best standards
-
based one for our students. With the need for continued technology upgrades, the district is committed to purchasing at 
least 30 new Chromebo
oks each year and upgrading our existing bandwidth.
 
 
We conduct annual verification of textbooks and have a process in place to order replacements on a needed basis.

School Facility Co
nditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Washington School was built in the early 1900s and facilities consist of a main building that houses the office, IMC room, an
d four classrooms. A fairly 
new gymnasium with two rooms attached now 
houses the library in one room and the computer lab in the other. This gymnasium facility also houses a 
modern kitchen and cafeteria where lunch is served to Washington students. The gymnasium also has a full stage for theatrical
 
productions. A small 
room 
or old office is used in the main classroom building for Special Education testing, for individualized education plans (IEPs)
, for conferences, as well 
as for one
-
on
-
one speech therapy services. Additionally, we built 4 new classrooms with all new furnitur
e to accommodate our TK
-
3rd grade students.
 
 
A storage shop is also on site to store tools and equipment. The site has a large playing field used for sports; it also has 
as a paved playground area with 
basketball and volleyball courts as well as a play are
a with swings and other playground equipment.
 
 
The school site is clean and well maintained. The equivalent of one full
-
time custodian, along with the shared maintenance and operations District person, 
maintain and keep facilities clean and safe.
 
 
A regula
r maintenance schedule is maintained to ensure that classrooms and restrooms are cleaned daily and available to students and 
staff without any 
interruption to the school day. Continuous modernization and maintenance is conducted according to our five
-
year 
maintenance plan as well as with our 
District and site strategic plan. Our facilities are inspected twice per year using a checklist and repairs conducted in acco
rdance.
 
 
All areas that may be found in need of repairs are dealt with immediately with the hi
ghest priority given to those posing a safety hazard to our students.
 
 
For future facility improvements in the near future, we are hoping to paint all classrooms and site buildings. Additionally, 
with the passing of a local bond, 
we will be consolidating t
he campuses onto the Washington School site as well as modernizing the existing main building at Washington School.
 
 
The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides State
-
matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basi
s, to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this in
cludes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor syst
ems.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not;
 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

Our district understands that it takes a partnership between the school and home in order to help our students succeed and me
et quarterly and annual 
individual goals.  We promote parental involvement throughout the year and 
encourage all parents to be active in the various programs that we have to 
offer.  School volunteers, chaperones, Parents Teacher Club (PTC), School Site Council (SSC) & Local Control Accountability P
lan (LCAP) advisory 
committee, tutors, fundraisers, clas
sroom helpers, and community

based tutoring programs are all examples of opportunities for parents to be involved 
in our school and district. This past year, we have partnered with the local high school district to provide our parents with
 
English learner 
classes.  In 
order to develop a stronger relationship with all of our parents and community members, we encourage them to be active member
s of the Merced River 
School District's learning community.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Staff and curriculum 
development continues to be the major focus for the Merced River Union Elementary School District. As a small, rural school d
istrict 
we tend to hire a fairly high number of new teachers and staff development needs are always at the forefront. We allot one 
day per week for early 
release days which are used for staff development.  These staff development days are used to focus on a variety of topics tha
t area crucial as we embark 
on new curriculum and new assessments.  We continue to focus on the integration 
of new State Standards (Common Core) in the areas of English 
Language Arts/English Language Development and Mathematics.  We are also focusing some of our training sessions to focus on w
riting, Next Generation 
Science Standards, English Language Developmen
t, California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP), English Learner Proficiency 
Assessments for California, Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) and the Local Control Accountability Plan (
LCAP).
 
 
Merced River Union Eleme
ntary School District has scheduled these training days around these topics and will continue to promote and encourage staff 
to seek and participate in staff development and professional growth opportunities. The district administration strongly enco
urages
 
all staff, both 
certificated and classified, to attend conferences and workshops that will allow them as employees to better serve our studen
ts. The district also receives 
support from the Merced County Office of Education to provide staff development for
 
our staff throughout the year.
 
 
In the upcoming school years, we will continue to dedicate the staff development sessions on the topics mentioned above to he
lp better prepare our 
teachers and staff.
