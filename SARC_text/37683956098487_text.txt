By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or
 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
pr
incipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Nicoloff provides a safe, clean environment for learning. Nicoloff's enrollment is at student capacity. Security is bolstered
 
by the
 
presence of a security resident who lives on the property and inspects the property during nights and weekends to 
prevent vandalism and theft. In addition, surveillance cameras are located throughout the campus.
 
 
District Maintenance and Custodial staff t
ake great care in ensuring that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. Lawns 
are mowed on Saturdays in an effort to minimize any classroom disturbances. Cleaning schedules are developed by the 
Principal and the Facilities Director to guarantee daily 
cleaning of campus. Restroom facilities are inspected three times a 
day by the Head Custodian to ensure they are fully stocked and in full working order. Any needed repairs are addressed 
in a timely manner. Copies of inspections are available at the school
 
and facilities offices.
 
 
The Head Custodian also performs a safety inspection on a monthly basis. The monthly report is submitted to the facilities 
office. Regular and preventative maintenance is ongoing. The district employs a computerized online work or
der system 
for efficiency and better record keeping. As per Education Code, the district is required to include in this document, a 
description of any needed maintenance to ensure good repair as specified in statute. "Good Repair" means the facility is 
mai
ntained in a manner that assures that it is clean, safe, and functional as determined pursuant to a Facilities Inspection 
Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction (OPSC). The FIT will evaluate the 
conditions at a
 
school site with ratings of "good," "fair," or "poor." The FIT also provides an overall summary of the 
conditions at each school on a scale of "exemplary," "good," "fair," or "poor." The instrument shall not require capital 
enhancements beyond the standar
ds to which the facility was designed and constructed.
 
 
SCHOOL FACILITIES GOOD REPAIR STATUS
 
Nicoloff's original campus was built in 1978, with an addition of a newer facility in 1994. The table below displays results 
of the most recently completed school 
site inspection to determine the school facility's good repair status.
 
 
OVERALL SUMMARY OF SCHOOL FACILITY GOOD REPAIR STATUS
 
At the time of the above inspection on August 12, 2019, the average ranking for Nicoloff Elementary was 96.40%, giving 
the school 
a rating of "Good." The rating is determined by the average of the 15 categories addressed. Below are the 
percentages, descriptions, and ratings, as per the Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT).
 
 
Please note that all needed repairs or deficiencies identified i
n the August FIT report have been completed and/or 
resolved.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
incl
udes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. 
Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilitie
s); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The South Bay Union School District academic calendar includes two full days 
and approximately 30 out of 51 possible 
minimum days that are dedicated to staff development. The two full days are placed at the start of the academic school 
year, while the minimum days occur throughout the year.  Professional Learning Communities (PLCs)
 
are at the heart of 
all staff development, ensuring a deeper implementation of effective instructional strategies, driven by student 
achievement data. Teachers meet with their grade level teams in PLCs two hours per month. In addition, administrators 
cond
uct 8.5 professional development hours during designated "Principal PLC" days.  Nicoloff's highest instructional 
priority is to continue to address balanced literacy instruction by implementing Writing and Reading Workshop models 
and focus on student gaps 
through small group reading instruction and one on one conferring.  Through Writing Workshop, 
teachers provide a supportive and safe environment for our students to write authentically on a daily basis.  After teacher 
led mini
-
lessons, opportunities are cr
eated for our students to engage in independent writing that is personal and 
meaningful by allowing them to have choice in the topics they write about. Teachers meet with small groups or confer 
with students during this time.  Students in Reader's Workshop
 
blocks benefit from one
-
on
-
one and small group support 
from teachers as students are released to read long stretches of time and are given opportunities to write and talk in 
response to texts.  We have partnered with the Teachers College (TC) Reading and 
Writing Project, a research organization 
at Columbia University, to develop students who are critical readers and writers.Professional development is conducted 
through the use of TC staff developers for Grades TK
-
6.  Classroom walkthroughs are conducted to
 
coach teachers and 
gather instructional data to inform next steps in professional development.
 
 
At Nicoloff, during the school years of 2017
-
2018 and 2018
-
2019, the major area of focus for professional development 
was literacy instruction. Professional de
velopment was provided by the Teacher's College. Each grade level received 10 
hours of days of professional development over the span of 5 days during the school year. Topics of support for teachers 
were selected by the results of the DRA2 Reading Assessme
nt, CAASSP assessment and the specific needs of teachers by 
grade level. Professional development was provided during the instructional day with the use of guest teachers. In 
addition, several opportunities were offered to teachers after the contract day w
ith a focus on reading instruction. In 
addition, Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) offered support to teachers through individual and grade level support 
and coaching. Teachers were also supported by the Principal and Assistant Principal via classroom 
observations where 
both provided specific feedback on instructional practices. In the 2018
-
2019 school year, all classroom teachers 
participated in eight (8) hour long administrative directed Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) in which they 
analyzed 
the data from reading assessments and student work to form groups for small group instruction. In the area of 
mathematics, each teacher received four hours of professional development by the Math TOSAs and Learning and 
Innovation Coordinator. For the 2019
-
2020 school year, the following professional development has been conducted thus 
far: a) Restorative Practices b) PLC+ c) TK
-
3 Guided Reading and d) Leader in Me program which included both certificated 
and classified staff. For the rest of the current sch
ool year, professional development will include small group instruction 
led by TOSAs and the site principal. This will be conducted during two days of the instructional day. Site principal will 
continue to provide individual teacher feedback during classro
om observations.
