students in grade five. The physical fitness test measures each
student's ability to complete fitness tasks in six major areas.
Students who either meet or exceed the standards in all six fitnessareas are considered to be in the "healthy fitness zone." The chartreported in this document reports only the percentage in each
category, not a cumulative total of the results for categories 4 of 6
and 5 of 6. Comparative district and state results can be found at theCDE's website.Physical Fitness TestPercentage of Students Meeting California Fitness Standards2018-19Percentage of Students Meeting StandardsGrade LevelTestedFour of Six FitnessStandardsFive of Six FitnessStandardsSix of Six FitnessStandardsFifth15.213.16.2Note: Percentages are not calculated and double dashes (--) appear in the tablewhen the number of students tested is ten or less, either because the number of
students in this category is too small for statistical accuracy or to protect studentprivacy. California Assessment of Student Performance andProgressThe California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress(CAASPP) System includes the Smarter Balanced Summative
Assessments (SBAC) for students in the general education
population, and the California Alternate Assessments (CAAs) for
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities.  Only eligible
students may participate in the administration of the CAAs.  CAAs
items are aligned with alternative achievement standards, which are
linked with the Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  CAASPP
results are a measure of how well students are mastering
California's standards in English language arts/literacy (ELA) and
mathematics, and are given to grades three through eight and grade
eleven. SBAC tests assess student performance in ELA/Literacy and
mathematics utilizing computer-adaptive tests and performancetasks, and CAAs test items are aligned with alternative achievementstandards which are linked with the Common Core State Standards
(CCSS).The CAASPP results shown in this report include overall resultscomparing the school, district and state scores as well as the
school's overall score in each applicable subgroup. Results are
shown only for subgroups with ten students or more taking the exam.
For those categories that are blank in the tables, no students met
subgroup criteria. More information on CAASPP can be found on the

safe, and functional through proper facilities maintenance and
campus supervision. Robert Bruce Elementary School's original

improvements ensure facilities remain up to date and provide
adequate space for students and staff. District maintenance and site
custodial staff ensure that the repairs necessary to keep the school

process is used by school and district staff to communicate
non-routine maintenance requests. Emergency repairs are given the
highest priority. In the last 12 months, the following improvements
have been completed:
