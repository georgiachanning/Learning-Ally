By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg

.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Harry C. Fulton Middle School has a proud tradition of providing a world
-
class education for students in the Fountain Valley 
community since 1967.   Thanks to Measure O funding approved by the Fountain Valley community in 2016, the Fulton 
campus
 
is undergoing significant renovations that will improve infrastructure and update amenities in classrooms to 
continue serving students.  Approximately 750 students in grades 6
-
8 attend Fulton Middle School.  Unique to Fulton 
Middle School is that many of 
the students are the second or third generation to live in the neighborhood and attend 
Fulton, which accounts for the closeness of the community.
 
 
Fulton has received numerous awards, including California Distinguished School Awards (2009, 2013, and 2019),
 
and a 
California Gold Ribbon School Award in 2015.  We are fortunate to have a staff of 30+ teachers who are dedicated to the 
education of our students 
-
 
many of whom hold advanced degrees in Education or their content area of expertise.  Staff 
members pa
rticipate in rigorous professional development designed to equip teachers with high
-
impact, research
-
based 
teaching strategies to bring out the best in students.  Fulton's number one goal is to focus on increasing student 
achievement through an engaging, r
igorous, standards
-
based instructional program, while at the same time, providing a 
highly enriched educational and social environment for our middle school students resulting in high levels of student
-
indicated school connectedness.  Fulton students benef
it from outstanding classroom instruction in all areas, and a 
dedicated team of educational specialists, including a Resource Specialist, three Special Day Class teachers, a Speech and 
Language Pathologist and School Psychologist, provide the support neede
d to help students with special needs achieve to 
their full potential.
 
 
Fulton Middle School is proud to provide students with access to a broad course of study through a dynamic electives 
program that includes leadership classes, yearbook, Peer Assistance
 
League, vocal and instrumental music classes, and 
STEM
-
related courses including Robotics.  In addition, Fulton is dedicated to supporting students with needs across the 
full continuum of achievement including intervention support classes, co
-
teaching cla
sses that provide full
-
inclusion 
opportunities for students with special needs, and honors courses 
-
 
all with the goal of making sure that every student is 
fully prepared for success in high school and to pursue all of their college and career aspirations.
 
 
Fulton Middle School is also proud to have a very active Parent Teacher Association who supports our school in many ways 
including fundraising, providing parent volunteers for campus events and activities, supplementing district
-
provided 
technology resou
rces, funding assemblies, and generally contributing to the development of a connected, positive 
learning environment for students.  Parents play an instrumental role in helping Fulton realize its goals by serving on 
School Site Council, English Learner Ad
visory Council, and various sub
-
committees of the Fulton PTA.  Parental involvement 
and support are key ingredients to making Fulton Middle School one of the finest schools in Orange County. While Fulton 
Middle School enjoys high levels of student achievem
ent, the staff, parents, and administration are all committed to 
working together for continuous improvement and ways to maximize student learning and development.

Cleaning Process:
 

Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the
 
District. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily 
basis throughout the school year with an emphasis on classrooms and restrooms. A joint effort between students and 
staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-
free. The principal works daily wi

sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair:
 

omplex 
maintenance functions occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered 
by Fountain Valley School District's Maintenance & Operations Department to ensure that school grounds and facilities 
remain in ex
cellent repair. A work order process is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. Emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority; repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received
.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance 
Budget:
 
Deferred maintenance includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. Fountain Valley School District did not participate in the State School Deferred Maintenance 
Budget Pr
ogram. Fountain Valley School District sets aside funds each year to specifically address deferred maintenance 
needs. The passing of Measure O provided additional, much
-
needed funds for these types of projects.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents and the community are very supportive of the educational program at Fulton Middle School. Fulton Middle School 
has a very active and involved PTA that supports our school and we encourage all 
parents to join. Parents are encouraged 

school committees and councils.  There is a variety of ways to become involved ranging from
 
one
-
time events to weekly 
commitments.  During most school years, the Fulton community logs close to 18,000 hours of volunteer service to the 
school.
 
 
Many parents choose to get involved with the classes/clubs/sports in which their children participate. W
e offer choir, rock 
band, orchestra, band, and guitar which perform numerous times throughout the year and parent volunteers are an 
integral part of the shows' success. Parents also volunteer with our Robotics club and competition teams. Fulton hosts an 
In
ter
-
district volleyball tournament and a track and field meet which are also excellent opportunity for parents to become 
involved and cheer on their students.

The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake 
standards. The Safety Committee reviews and updates the Safe School Action Plan each year by March 1st. Any and a
ll 
revisions to the plan are immediately communicated to classified and certificated staff and are presented to the School 
Site Council for additional input and review.
 
 
The Goals and Objectives in the Safe School Action Plan focus on three areas:
 
1)  A 
school climate characterized by caring and connectedness,
 
2)  The safe and orderly physical environment of the school, and
 
3)  The health and wellness of students.
 
 
To supplement the Safe School Action Plan, every school also has a disaster preparedness pl
an that includes steps for 
ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire, disaster, and lockdown drills are conducted on a rotating basis 
monthly throughout the school year.  Fulton staff participated in professional development related to safe
ty during the 
2019
