By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school district is a small district with 
approximately 2,000 students.  Therefore, all schools are covered by a district 
wide Safe Schools Plan. This plan stresses emergency preparation and was developed in conjunction with law enforcement 
and county emergency services.  All buildings housing stu
dents meet Field Act standards.  The Fire Department and the 
district inspect facilities annually.

Over the past three years our district has spent a great deal of professional learning on positive behavior 
intervention 
support (PBIS), social emotional academic development (SEAD), and multi
-
tiered systems of support (MTSS). In 2016
-
2017, 
district administration including the Superintendent, Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services, Director of Student
 
Services and two principals participated in eight days of implementation training for Multi
-
Tiered System of Supports, 
MTSS.  From this professional development, and through a specialized grant, the district is participating in a second year 
of PBIS suppo
rt at two schools, Soquel and Santa Cruz Gardens Elementary Schools. Leadership teams from each of these 
site are comprised of the principal, teachers, campus supervisors and parents. These teams are in initial implementation 
and data collection phases. PB
IS is the continued work at each school site, as is SEAD, which include alternative means of 
correction, RULER, mindfulness, classroom charters and more.
 
 
Some development by content/subject are as follows:
 
 
Math:  Silicon Valley Math Initiative has been o
ffered as a summer week
-
long training opportunity for the 2013
-
2019 
years.  Approximately 20 teachers participated each year.  For the year 2016
-
2019 all elementary teachers participated in 
Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI) training. In 2016
-
2019 middle
 
school math teachers received professional 

daily support level, teachers are supported through in
-
class and after school coaching from tw
o math teachers on special 
assignment.
 
 
English Language Arts:   Between 2015
-
2019 elementary school teachers have received professional development for 
Readers/Writers workshop through Momentum. In 2018
-
2019 a Readers/Writers teacher on special assignment
 
was hired 
full time to support staff with the curriculum complexities. Teachers were also given the opportunity to participate in half 
day release so they could observe veteran teachers and then debrief with a small group that was viewing the lesson.
 
 
ELA
/ELD:  English Language Development teachers, Principals and District Administration have trained at the County Office 
of Education and attended the ELA/ELD Framework Intensive Summer Institute offered through WestEd in 2015
-
2016.  
This focus of study is c
ontinuing through 2016
-
2017 for the ELD teachers from each site.  In  both 2017
-
2018 and 2018
-
2019 all principals, Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services and ELD specialists were trained in the new ELPAC 
testing. However, most recently a speciali
st, teacher and administrative representative team has begun training on the 
English Learner Roadmap, with the Multi
-

 
 
History Social Science:  In 2017
-
2018 teachers were offered a day at the county 
office to review the new frameworks.  All 
of the middle school Humanities teachers attended, along with a few of our elementary level teachers.
 
 
Science:  In 2017
-
2018 the NBMS science department along with the vice principal participated in two days of tr
aining on 
the transition to NGSS.  In 2018
-
2019 a vertical team made up of the Superintendent, Assistant Superintendent, one 
elementary principal, the middle school vice principal and four teachers worked with the Lawrence Hall of Science Bay Sci 
group to 
learn about NGSS and look at materials adoption. Most recently, Soquel Union Elementary has partnered with 
BAY SCI to further science and NGSS throughout our district. Through this partnership, a new science mission has been 
developed and communicated, a t
imeline has been created, a science leadership team has formed, regular leadership 
meetings are held
-
 
focusing on best science practices, and district
-
wide staff development in the areas of Evidence 
Statements and Science journaling have been jointly plann
ed and implemented.
 
 
In addition to all of the above, for the past three years teachers have participated in three professional development days 
per year on non
-
student days, as well as one and a half hours on early release Fridays to engage in targeted di
strict
-
led 
development, grade level collaboration, or school
-
focused meeting time.  And because the needs of each site and teacher 
team differ, an additional several days are set aside for local
-
 
interest professional development.
