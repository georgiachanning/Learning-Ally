About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is requi
red by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs)
 
are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an 
LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should con
tact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Safety Plan
 
James Dukes places strong emphasis on safety of students and staff. Our emergency plan was revised in October 2019, and it ha
s been reviewed annually. 
Our staff is well versed in our safety procedures, and the parents/community have been provided access to
 
our transparent procedures. Regularly 
scheduled fire, lockdown, and disaster drills are conducted to ensure that our students and staff know what to do if we ever 
have to deal with an 
emergency on campus. Our campus is locked during school hours so all vi
sitors must enter campus through the office and all volunteers are required to 

learance per our board 
policy.

Types of Services Funded
 
We believe all students can learn, and we recognize that all students learn and retain information in different ways. For stu
dents with differing learning 
styles or disabilities, RUSD has a wide variety of intervention programs. The District provides regul
ar education, categorical programs and additional 
educational opportunities designed to help all students meet or exceed grade
-
level standards and to prevent students from falling behind. Federal 
categorical and additional educational opportunities are fun
ded through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which was reauthorized in 2015 
as the Every Student Succeeds Act. These programs include, Title I (English Language Arts and Mathematics support); Title II 
(Improving Teacher Quality); 
Title III (supp
ort for English Language Acquisition and improving Family Engagement); Title IV (support for elementary music and PE and seco
ndary 
technology and vaping cessation). State funding provides supplemental dollars so the District can provide additional service 
to unduplicated count 
students, including foster youth, English language learners, homeless youth, and students of low income families. RUSD offers
 
a wide variety of alternative 
education programs and settings, including the Ramona Community Campus which h
ouses the Ramona Community Montessori School (TK
-
6) and Mt. 
Valley Academy (TK
-
12 School/Independent Study); Future Bound (7
-
12 off campus Independent Study); and Montecito Continuation High School (9
-
