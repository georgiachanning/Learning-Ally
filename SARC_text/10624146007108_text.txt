By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
Centerville's Vision is that Chargers will be compassionate, life
-
long learners by: communicating effectively, taking risks, 
and thinking critically to be prepared toward achieving college a
nd career readiness.  Teachers will support them by 
ensuring that Teachers will work collaboratively, set high expectations, and employ instructional practices that ensure 
student success.
 
 
Centerville (CV) is located 16 miles east of Fresno, CA.  It is a 
small town east of Sanger with a population of about 400.  
Centerville Elementary serves 313 students in a K
-
6 setting. One hundred percent of our students participate in the Free 
or Reduced
-
Priced Lunch Program. Approximately 25% of students are considere
d English Language Learners. The percent 
of Hispanic or Latino students is 58%, 2.8% Asian, 32.8% White, and 2.4 Multiple.  We service 6% students with disabilities 
and 1% migrant.
 
 
We set high standards for our staff, students and community that go beyond
 
academic success, standards which require 
everyone involved to set examples that the community can observe and respect. We are a community of caring! With the 
loving guidance of dedicated staff, our children make cross
-
curricular connections, while develo
ping persistence and 
personal responsibility, qualities that are the foundation of academic excellence. This is evidenced in the classrooms where 
the Community of Caring (CoC) values are proudly displayed alongside the State content standards. While this a
pplication 
explains aspects of our school that deal with personal/social development and academic achievement, we further 
recognize that it is the commitment of caring people that provides is the cement that binds all else together.
 
 
Parents are actively i
nvolved and serve in leadership capacities through the School Site Council (SSC) and the Parent 
Teacher Association (PTA). Parent volunteers are visible daily, providing support and assistance throughout the school. 
We have at least ten volunteers a day!
 
 
Being committed to academic excellence, we offer no excuses for failure to achieve. While acknowledging problems and 
obstacles, our focus is on finding solutions through our Response to Intervention (RtI) services. Regular Professional 
Learning Committee (
PLC) meetings and articulation across and amongst the grade levels allow us to plan and pursue 
academic goals, as we are constantly mindful of the fact that achievement is limited only by the size of our dreams and 
the amount of effort we are willing to pu
t forth in pursuit of our goals. Collaboration, dialogue, reflection and 
accountability are the norm. In partnership with our Board and district administration, we regularly monitor the needs of 
our students, staff and parents through surveys and group mee
tings. Our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement guides our 
path and helps us monitor achievement data. Our methods and results are routinely evaluated through site and district 
assessments. We have created a culture of success and an environment instilled w
ith the standards of excellence 
necessary to provide students with a meaningful education, one that promotes academic achievement and social 
development and extends to a successful transition to middle school and beyond.

The entire School Based 
Coordinated Program is managed between our supplemental Title I and Local Control Funding 
Formula Targeted Funds budgets and is monitored by the principal, and SSC/ELAC. The principal regularly monitors and 
coordinates budgets, programs, and implementation
 
in the areas of the instructional program, academic support, 
professional development and parent and community involvement. This assures that all of Centerville School's students 
are able to receive additional services to help them experience success in t
he core program. To guarantee student 
participation in all coordinated programs, the principal oversees a plan to involve staff and community in an effort to 
increase student attendance.
 
 
As the hub of the community, Centerville is a place where families and community members gather regularly to support, 
celebrate and honor the diverse achievements of all our children. Partnerships with local businesses such as Vulcan 
Building Materials mak
e many activities possible. Centerville is unique because parents, teachers and business leaders 
work together to inspire and promote academic excellence while honoring the hopes, abilities and talents of our children. 
Our school is a family, bound togethe
r through affection and shared goals, our history and a firm commitment to building 
a strong future.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most 
Recent Year)
 
 
Sanger Unified retains an independent contractor to provide comprehensive facilities inspection of every school site. This 
inspection meets or exceeds the criteria of the State of California Williams inspection requirement. The Williams 
comp
liance inspections are done by Fresno County Office of Education (FCOE). Only one SUSD site is inspected by Fresno 
County Office of Education annually for Williams compliance. This site is not a FCOE inspected site. The most recent 
inspection, either distr
ict or Williams, available when this SARC is prepared is utilized for this report. Inspection reports 
are maintained at the SUSD District Office.
 
 
The rating scale used for this inspection is as follows:
 
 
99% 
-
 
100% = Exemplary: School meets most/all stand
ards of good repair. Noted deficiencies, if any, are not significant.
 
 
90% 
-
 
98.99% = Good: School maintained in good repair with some isolated deficiencies from wear/tear or are being 
mitigated.
 
 
75% 
-
 
89.99% = Fair: School is not in good repair with 
some critical or widespread deficiencies and repairs are necessary.
 
 
00% 
-
 
74.99% = Poor: School facilities are in poor condition with deficiencies of various degrees throughout and major 
repairs are necessary.
 
 
The results of the most recent report availa
ble for this campus are disaggregated below.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school site has a Safe School Plan that is reviewed and updated annually with completion by October.  Plans are 
reviewed with staff annually.  Centerville School Site Council (SSC) approves our Safe School Plan.  Emergency drills are 
conducted to prepa
re students and staff in the event of an emergency.  We strive to maintain a safe, healthful, nurturing 
and orderly school campus that encourages positive attitudes in students and staff.  A joint effort between students and 
staff help keep the campus clea
n and litter free.  Site maintenance staff surveys their campus as the first order of business 
each day.  They insure the campus is clean, any vandalism is corrected, and that the campus is presentable and 
representative of the priority Sanger School Board
 
sets on safety and appearance.  Oversight of Sanger Unified Safe School 
Plans is through the Welfare and Attendance Officer.  This site's Safe School Plan was reviewed with site staff on October 
16, 2019.

What are the primary/major areas of focus for staff development and specifically how were they selected? For example, 
were student achievement data used to determine the need for professional development in reading instruction?
 
 
All of our professional dev
elopment is based on the needs of our students and teachers, assessed through observations, 
surveys, disaggregation of SBAC data, PBIS data and other assessment data. Teachers in Sanger Unified have completed 
professional training courses designed to suppo
rt educational priorities and objectives. Staff Development Days are 
designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for administrators, teachers and classified personnel.
 
 
What are the methods by which professional development is delivered (e.g., af
ter school workshops, conference 
attendance, individual mentoring, etc.)?
 
 
As a district, we are committed to offering teachers a variety of professional learning opportunities and options for 
personalized professional development. Sanger Unified provides 
professional learning in all subjects (Math, STEAM, ELA, 
ELD, assessments etc.) for TK
-
6th grade teachers throughout the school year. For single
-
subject teachers, Sanger Unified 
provides two to four full days of training dedicated to specific initiatives, 
strategies and frameworks (Balanced Literacy, 
Guaranteed and Viable Instruction, ELD, Writing, Speaking and Listening, Close Reading, Project Based Learning, Universal 
Design for Learning, etc.) Sanger Unified also offers after
-
school workshops on various 
math instructional strategies and 
routines, after
-
school technology trainings and Universal Design for Learning trainings. Each year, we offer a district 
conference where teachers share their best practices with one another. Teacher leaders at all sites ar
e given a variety of 
opportunities to attend national and state conferences and seminars, as to further the collective knowledge of all 
members of their grade level teams and learning communities. Teachers also have the opportunity to engage in 
personalize
d professional development through instructional coaching.
 
 
New to the profession Teachers are also supported through the Sanger Unified School District Beginning Teacher Support 
and Assessment Induction Program (BTSA) and New Teacher Support. A teacher th
at is teaching under a PIP or STSP, or is 
an Intern is assigned a mentor that provides the new teacher with a minimum of 4 hours per week of direct or indirect 
support for his/her individualized professional growth. In addition, the teachers attend require
d professional development 
provided by the district and school site. New teachers that have a preliminary credential participate in our formal BTSA 
Induction Program. Teachers participating in BTSA receive support from a trained support provider for two ye

the program may offer additional professional development offerings based on participant request and through surveys 
that include the following: Clas
sroom Management, Conducting Parent Teacher Conferences/Parent communication, 
Meeting the needs of special needs students, Technology, Writing, etc. Sanger Unified's BTSA Induction Program provides

students. The mentors, called support providers, are trained in cognitive c
oaching, working with adult learners, and FACT. 
Support Providers attend a two

required to attend an orientation, and 2 after school trainings each year to work on 
their mentoring skills.

How are teachers supported during implementation (e.g., through in
-
class coaching, teacher
-
principal meetings, student 
performance data reporting, etc.)? With so many district initiatives, it is essential to have 
support for all teachers and 
administrators during implementation. Through many of our contracted trainings (Balanced Literacy, NGSS, UDL), our 
expert trainers provide on
-
site support and follow up personalized coaching. There are varied levels of support,
 
both at 
the site and district level. At school sites, teachers are supported during implementation by their grade
-
level or content 
colleagues through Professional Learning Communities. In addition, Curriculum Support Providers, Literacy Specialist 
Teacher
s, (Teachers on Special Assignment) and administrators provide on site support. District support is provided at the 
PLC level through collaborative unit/lesson planning and facilitated curriculum curating experiences.
 
 
 
All of our professional development 
is based on our students and teachers needs. Teachers in Sanger Unified have 
completed professional training courses designed to support educational priorities and objectives. Staff Development 
Days are designed to provide continuous learning opportunities
 
for administrators, teachers and classified personnel.
 
 
Sanger Unified uses Staff Development Days and support from site level Curriculum Support Providers and district level 
District Instructional Specialists to assist teachers in classroom instructional
 
strategies. The district provided a strong base 
for Common Core English Language Arts Implementation over the last few years through professional development 
focused on academic vocabulary, content reading and writing, and unpacking standards. This year t
he district will provide 
an extensive Math training on the mathematical practices, math tasks, and academic discourse. Further English Language 
Arts professional development will focus on writing mini lessons and units.
 
 
New to the profession Teachers are 
also supported through the Sanger Unified School District Beginning Teacher Support 
and Assessment Induction Program (BTSA). Teachers participating in BTSA receive support from a trained support provider 
for two years. The Sanger BTSA program uses the Form
ative Assessment for California Teachers (FACT) formative 
assessment to guide "new" teachers in their professional growth. The Sanger BTSA program also provides a menu of 
professional development opportunities for BTSA Participating Teachers, Support Provi
ders, and invites all teachers in the 
district to participate, if the topic meets their need. The menu of professional development offerings include the following:
 
Classroom Management, Conducting Parent Teacher Conferences/Parent communication, Meeting th
e needs of special 
needs students, Technology, UDL, Writing, etc. Sanger Unified's BTSA Induction Program provides support and assessment 
opportunities for all first and second year Participating Teachers to increase understanding of their own professional
 
development, which will enable them to more effectively meet the diverse learning needs of their students.
 
 
In addition to staff development days, teachers participate in workshops and conferences on the following: Literacy 
Strategies, Writing, Reading an
d Literacy Training, and ongoing SBE textbook adoption in
-
services are provided throughout 
the first 2
-
years of a curriculum, text implementation period. In
