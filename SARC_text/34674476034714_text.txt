By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We have some very exciting academic focus areas happening at our school. This kind of teaching and learning looks 
different from when most of us attended school. However, these practices help studen
ts to develop 21st century skills 
like collaboration, innovation, and problem
-
solving which help our students to be college and career ready. These skills 
are called out in the Common Core State Standards. Balanced Literacy is research
-
based instructional 
practices that 
develop skills and strategies within each child that will allow them to problem
-
solve effectively and become reflective, 
critical, and analytical readers, writers, thinkers, and speakers. Balanced Literacy is delivered using a workshop model
. In 
order to meet the Common Core Standards in mathematics, we have implemented the district elementary math adoption 
and Math Talks. Math Talks are conversations in a mini
-
lesson format which are taught in 10
-
20 minute periods where 
students discuss math
 
concepts. Math Talks helps to boost memory, deepen math reasoning abilities and promote 
language development. With an unrelenting focus on critical and creative thinking, collaboration, and the use of 
technology, students will naturally become more succes
sful in science and social studies as it is integrated into the 
academic areas.
 
 
MISSION STATEMENT
 
The mission of Mariposa Avenue Elementary School, a community of leaders, is to inspire and equip all students to be 
global thinkers, advocates for 
their success, and people of integrity through comprehensive innovative instruction, positive 
development of character, and partnerships with families and our community.
 
 
SCHOOL PROFILE
 
The successful education of all students is our number one goal at Mar

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September, 2018
 
 
San Juan Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018 and determined that each school wit
hin the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual stand
ards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the t
extbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the quality, currency, and availability of 
the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional mat
erials used at the school. If you would like more information 
on the textbooks and instructional materials please visit our website: http://www.sanjuan.edu/Page/23485 In July 2009, 
EC Section 60200.7. The State Board of Education has adopted frameworks for
 
ELA/ELD, Math, Science and Social 
Sciences, and has identified an approved list of instructional materials available for adoption. For more information

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Mariposa Elementary School, constructed in 1950, was modernized during the 1996
-
1997 and the 2002
-
2003 school years. 
In 2005, utilizing Measure J Bond funds, a new heating and air conditioning unit was installed in the MP 
room. Currently, 
there is sufficient space to house the student population. Site custodial staff clean the buildings, along with district supp
ort 
for major/minor repairs. The district provides gardening and landscape services on a regular schedule. Regular
 
fire/emergency drills are held, and badges are required for all visitors and personnel.  Field repair and an irrigation syste
m 
retrofit continue to be concerns. Under Measure J, the entire site parking and hard court areas were resurfaced along with 
upgra
des for ADA accessibility and the storm water system in summer 2005. In 2009, all student restrooms were 
refurbished and in 2011 a portion of the exterior of the campus was painted.  Using measure J funds, a site
-
wide landscape 
and irrigation project was c
ompleted Winter 2013.  This included ornamental fencing, sidewalks and ramps, storm drains 
and sewer lines, grass, plants and trees.
 
 
The Board of Education and the Superintendent's policy is to ensure that all students are provided with a safe and well
-
ma
intained learning environment. The board approved resolutions in 1998 and 2002 to adequately fund maintenance 
activities and preserve the repairs and improvements funded by two facility bond measures. The school buildings, 
classrooms and grounds are safe, 
clean and functional. An inspection of the facility was conducted in August 2019 and 
determined that there were no unsafe conditions that required emergency repairs. District maintenance staff ensures 
that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good r
epair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
computer automated work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs and health and 
safety repairs are given the highest priority. The Board of Education has adopte
d cleaning standards and custodial staffing 
requirements for all schools in the district. This school meets the Board's standards for custodial staffing and cleanliness.
 
The school's custodians are trained in the proper use of cleaning chemicals and Integr
ated Pest Management techniques. 
They are managed day to day by the Principal with assistance from the district's maintenance department. The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, with funding allocated for major repair or
 
replacement 
of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. Annually the district budgets $2 million dollars for deferred 
maintenance activities.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of s

a Community Safety Specialist assigned to this school within a geographic zone that includes nearby schools. In addition, 
via a part


school. The Deputy Sherif
fs are assigned to patrol a geographic zone either on the east side of the district or the west side 
of the district. They are assigned specific schools within their assigned zone and respond to this school, or others, as safe
ty 
needs dictate. The two CHPD
 
Police Officers are School Resource Officers (SRO) who work identified schools within the 
City of Citrus Heights and respond as safety needs dictate. The two law enforcement agencies will overlap response when 

fficers are dispatched to critical incidents via the Safe Schools Dispatcher, 
a law enforcement dispatcher or via a direct report from a school staff member, school visitor or other person. This school 
has a school safety team which reviews safety matters 
that may affect the campus. Our school safety team meets regularly 
to discuss safety issues, update our site emergency plan, and to take steps to be proactive in preventing various types of 
school
-
related safety issues. Community Safety Specialists and law
 
enforcement provides speakers to address students, 
staff and community groups on matters of school safety. Our safety team receives training, when requested, from Safe 
Schools or law enforcement. This school is responsible for updating our Comprehensive S
chool Safety Plan (CSSP) by March 
1st of every year per the Education Code. As part of the update, this school meets at least once per year with a law 
enforcement officer to review the CSSP, has the local fire department review the CSSP and we hold a commu
nity meeting 
to review the CSSP. The CSSP must be approved by the School Site Council before being submitted to the district safe 

site sp
ecific crisis response procedures and a district standardized emergency flip chart. This school conducts and keeps a 
record of all fire drills, lockdown drills, shelter in place drills and/or earthquake drills up to or in excess of what is re
quired 
by the 
Education Code.

Professional development is a key part of the continuous improvement process for educators. The goal of our quality 
professional development is to support the learning of teachers and paraprofessionals to positively 
impact student 
achievement.  Annually, teachers and site administrators participate in professional development in a variety of 
opportunities.  Seventy
-
five minutes per week are dedicated to staff collaboration and training planned by site leadership 
teams
. The District also provides a cycle of continuous professional development for Administrators through Principal 
Networks as well as Leadership Academies.
 
 
The District provides professional development opportunities for teachers and administrators that su
pport the 
implementation of Common Core State Standards in English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and the 
ELA/ELD Framework.  Specific professional development initiatives include: Culturally Responsive Practices, Critical 
Literacy, T
K
-
2 Reading, Supporting Independence and Engagement through Reading and Writing, Math to the Core, 
Expository Reading and Writing Course, and ELD Foundations.  District departments, Center for Teacher Support, grant
-
funded projects, and the San Juan Teache

development opportunities are voluntary for teachers and are provided throughout the year in a variety of formats: during 
the school day, after school, on Saturdays, and during summer
 
and vacation breaks. Many teachers and administrators 
also take advantage of opportunities with Sacramento County Office of Education, California Department of Education, 
the college/university programs, state/national education organizations, and private
 
educational institutes.
 
 
What grounds the professional development in the district is the District Strategic Plan and the Local Control 
Accountability Plan. Professional Development is further determined using one or more of the following: (a) student 
ach
ievement data, (b) staff survey data, and (c) district
-
identified goals.  Professional development addresses the Common 
Core State Standards, teaching strategies, curriculum, assessment, technology, classroom management, safety, and 
leadership. Administrat
or training accompanies professional development in district focus areas, providing 
implementation support for teachers on site.  Content
-
area coaches are available at some schools.  Additional classroom 
support is provided to new and struggling teachers b
y consulting teachers from the Center for Teacher Support.
 
 
Paraprofessionals are encouraged to participate in professional development at the district and site level.  Specifically 
designed training is also offered to non
-
instructional support staff such 
as clerical and custodial staff that includes both 
operational and instructional topics.
