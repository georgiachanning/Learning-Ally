By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School 
Year 2019
-

Staff Pledge: We are committed to creating a school that knows no limits to the character development and academic 

 
Garden Road Elementary School is a family of learners where we believe that each and ever
y child is special and can learn 
and achieve at the highest levels.
 
 
We collaborate as a team and school community to support our students and help them 
develop thinking and academic success skills of problem solving and self awareness to become world clas
s learners.
 
 
We 
are committed to help our students develop a Growth Mindset, persevere with grit and motivation, and treat others and 
themselves in a respectful and kind manner.
 
 
We believe that together we can help our students achieve and succeed by 
maki
ng connections and building bridges to learning, curriculum, each other and the greater world around them.
 
 
Garden Road Elementary School is located in the southeast corner of the suburban community of Poway. One of the 
original Poway schools, Garden Road 
opened in 1961 and has a strong community base of parent involvement and 
support. Many of our families have lived in the Garden Road area for years, and are proud multi
-
generational families who 
have attended Garden Road.
 
 
Garden Road serves a diverse comm
unity with 54% white
 
students,
 
26% Hispanic, 7% Asian, 
and approximately 7% of the students are learning English as a second language.
 
 
We have 21% who participate in the 
free or reduced
-
price lunch program, and this is our second year receiving federal Ti
tle 1 funds to support our students at 
risk of not meeting academic standards and our goal is to close the achievement gap.
 
 
 
There are currently 490 students attending Garden Road, a student body that has remained relatively stable over the last 
few years
.
 
 
We are seeing some growth this year, especially in kindergarten.
 
 
We have three Special Day Classes who serve 
students with special needs and autism from preschool up through 5th grade.
 
 
We also have a parent participation 
preschool program that serves 
3
-
 
year old children and 4
-
 
year old children.
 
 
We have a dedicated staff of teachers, support 
staff, and specialists who are able to offer programs to meet the social, emotional, and academic needs of all students. 
We are very fortunate to have an involve
d and interested parent population who are active volunteers and supporters of 
our children and school programs through the PTA and Foundation.
 
 
Recognizing that each child is unique, the highly competent and caring staff at Garden Road encourages a sense 
of 
independence and responsibility for students, and promotes a joy of learning by providing innovative and varied 
experiences within a safe, orderly, and attractive setting. Our goal is to support the highest level of academic achievement 
as well as the s
ocial emotional growth of our students.
 
 
We have a comprehensive program through the umbrella of 
Positive Behavior and Intervention Supports (PBIS) including Character Counts, Second Steps program in all grades, and a 
promotion of and recognition of kindne
ss.
 
 
Our ultimate goal is for all students to achieve the necessary academic skills for success in school, to promote a lifelong 
love of learning, and to achieve success in our ever
-
changing society. We want to prepare our students for their future 
and to 
be world class learners for the 21st century. We strive to help our students have the skills and drive to be thinkers, 
problem solvers, and take personal ownership for their learning and achievement.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Poway Unified School District ensures that students attend clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section
 
17070.75(e), the District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each of its schools is maintained in good repair.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs
 
are given the highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and well maintained.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school
 
day.  A night custodial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms and offices daily.  
The district has adopted cleaning standards for all schools.  A summary of these standards is available at the district offic
es.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achi
evement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entranc
e to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Garden Road places strong emphasis on safety for students and staff. We embrace Character Counts by infusing these 
values into our Positive Behavior Plan, school assemblies, student recognition programs, lessons and murals.
 
 
Teachers, 
our 
school counselor and Student Support Assistant and the principal teach students problem solving skills, anti
-
bullying 
strategies and positive communication. Our staff, students, and families are focusing on developing a Growth Mindset and 
maintaining posit
ive attitudes and beliefs.
 
 
Our staff, PTA and School Site Council discuss current safety practices and make routine adjustments.
 
 
All school visitors 
must check in and out of the office and wear an identification badge, as all gates are locked during the 
school day.
 
 
Emergency plans are reviewed regularly and updated as needed. Annual training procedures and drills for earthquakes, 
fire and bus evacuation are held. Maintenance staff work with the school and custodians on a scheduled preventive 
program to o
ffset costly repairs. The school has an up to date Asbestos Plan. Extended Student Services is available to 
students for before and after school childcare.
 
 
Our Safety Plan goals have focused on our social climate promoting acceptance, respect for diversit
y, and social inclusion 
for all students and promoting positive social interactions and engagement among students.
 
 
Our physical environment goal focused on campus upgrades such as the perimeter fence, lighting, and field improvements, 
as well as clear communication for our safety procedures and processes.
