Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Cottage Hill Elementary School is located outside Grass Valley near the community of Lake of the Pines. It is one of four 
schools in the Pleasant Ridge Union School District. The school serves students in Kindergarten through fifth grades with 
a
n enrollment of 450 students.
 
 
The school principal is Karen Montero and Rusty S. Clark is the Superintendent. While noticing a change in demographics, 
the school enjoys a somewhat stable community that actively supports the many fine programs available to
 
students. A 
rigorous curriculum is designed for all students.
 
 
It is expected that each child will make progress from basic skill instruction to the application of this knowledge. The late
st 
technology, teaching strategies, skills, materials, and textbook
s are used to promote student learning. Students are 
recognized and encouraged for excellence in academic, social and physical achievement, not only in the individual 
classrooms but also in schoolwide events.
 
 
The school goals, as stated in the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement, include the creation of research
-
based programs 
for differentiated instruction to ensure continued success in reading and math and integration of technology into the 
curriculum.
 
 
Progress indicators for Cottage Hill School and for
 
the Pleasant Ridge Union District include statewide testing scores, which 
continue to exceed the state and county averages as well as formative and summative district assessments.
 
 
Our high level of student achievement directly reflects the quality of 

leadership and instructional team including the administration, teachers and support staff guide instruction in our 

quality of instruction provided.
