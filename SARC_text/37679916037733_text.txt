By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-

The Mission of Rios Elementary Computer Science School is to challenge each student to reach his/her full potential 
through high quality, well
-
balanced educational programs,  Our goal is to motivate each child and to instill in them a strong 
des
ire to learn.  In an environment that fosters positive self
-
esteem, each student will acquire knowledge and skills for 
life
-
long success.
 
 
Each child's needs will be assessed and appropriately addressed through well
-
prepared academic lessons.  Students wil
l 
learn to respect individual differences in an environment that is orderly, safe, positive, child
-
centered, and non
-
threatening.
 
 
On
-
going, effective communication among students, parents, and staff will create an atmosphere of mutual respect.  In 
an effo
rt to expand community understanding of the educational process, parents will be encouraged to participate in 
school activities and to volunteer, when possible.  High expectations, frequent monitoring of student progress, teaching 
to mastery, the use of a 
variety of teaching strategies, strong instructional leadership, and maximum use of learning time 
will guide us in structuring our daily program.
 
 
By achieving this mission, we will assist students in becoming productive citizens who embrace the process of
 
learning.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
 
The District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the Di
strict 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of P
ublic School Construction. This survey was 
completed on 05/01/2019 and is available at the Facilities, Maintenance and Operations office.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are 
pr
ovided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Facilities Description
 
This school has 17 permanent classrooms and 3 portable classrooms, a library, a multipurpose room, a computer lab, and 
an administration building. The main campus was b
uilt in 1959 with additions made in 1968. A portion of the campus was 
modernized in 1996. The balance was modernized in 2003. The multipurpose building was constructed in 1987. Facility 
improvement funds were used to replace the kindergarten play structure
.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repair
s are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The school is cleaned every third night by a three
-
person cleaning crew. Work performed includes: sweeping, vacuuming, 
and mopping floors, emptying trash, cleaning sinks, filling dispensers, 
and dusting rooms, as scheduled. Grounds are 
maintained by District groundskeeping staff. There is one full
-
time day custodian. This day custodian is responsible for 
daily restroom cleaning, cleaning eating and food preparation areas, daily grounds clean u
p, minor facility repairs, and 
special emergency clean ups. Carpets are shampooed and tile flooring is cleaned and refinished every winter, spring, and 
summer break. A thorough deep cleaning of all areas is done every summer. District administration works 
daily with 
custodial and grounds supervisors to ensure a clean, safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The District allocates funds for completion of deferred maintenance projects which consist of major repair or replacement 
of existing school building 
components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical 

funds were recently used to improve t

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessm
ents for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in t
he administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have
 
successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

(LCAP). Priorities 
for professional learning are established for teacher and staff training using student achievement data, teacher needs 
assessment surveys, and observations of instruction. In response to these priorities, sessions are developed to suppor
t 
classroom implementation. Teachers requiring additional certifications to meet student needs are enrolled in appropriate 
programs.
