By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Frontier Elementary School includes the Pioneer Union Elementary School District Office.  The campus is made up of 7 
buildings, which includes 3 that contain 25 
classrooms and a video conference room; a multi
-
use building, which houses 
the cafeteria and presentation stage; a school office building, consisting of the library, nurses station, conference room, 
and teacher work room; a district office building, which 
contains all district offices.  We provide a clean, safe environment 
for learning. The building facilities and grounds are in exceptional condition. The school is kept in top condition by a 
coordinated effort between the administration, District facilities
 
crews, all teachers, and all students. Each classroom 
maintains responsibility for a given area of the grounds. Our custodial crew consists of one full time day custodian and 
two evening custodians who perform basic cleaning operations in each classroom o
n a daily basis. In addition, deep 
cleaning is conducted each year at all school sites.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
The district custodial supervisor works daily with the custodial staff of one full
-
time custodian and two evening custodians 
to ensure that the cleani
ng of the school is maintained to provide for a clean and safe school. The district governing board 
has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the district 
office for review.
 
 
Maintenance an
d Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and work orders are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest priority is given to 
emergency r
epairs. While reviewing this report, please note that even minor discrepancies are reported in the inspection 
process.   The school also has a technology assistant that maintains and repairs all of the instructional technology availabl
e 
within the school.
 
 
Every morning before school begins, the day custodian opens the school gates and inspects school facilities for safety 
hazards and maintenance issues that require attention before staff and students arrive on campus.  Following a daily 
schedule, custodian
s check restrooms as needed as a proactive measure to keep facilities safe, sanitary, and stocked. 
Students share the responsibility to maintain a clean campus and notify the school office when restrooms or other campus 
areas require housekeeping. The day 

mealtime activities; cleaning the cafeteria after meals are served; cleaning restrooms and classrooms; lawn and grounds 
keeping maintenance; and fulfilling basic custodial ne
eds for students and staff. The evening custodians are responsible 
for setting up facilities for afternoon meetings and special events; cleaning classrooms, labs, library, restrooms, and offic
e 
areas; and vacuuming/mopping floor areas. Every night, the eve

and all the bathrooms to promote a healthy environment and minimize germs and bacterial growth.
 
 
The school district has also installed Solar Panels at Frontier Elementary.  This investment will cont
inually reduce the cost 
of electricity over the coming years .  Frontier Elementary has also joined the movement to become an earth
-
friendly 
school by having a student run recycling program.  Students work together to collect recycling throughout the schoo
l on 
a weekly basis.
 
 
Pioneer Union Elementary School District is proud of its high standards regarding campus maintenance and general 
housekeeping practices. The Board of Trustees along with district administration have approved and adopted specific 
clean
ing standards, schedules, and policies for maintaining clean, safe environments for everyone on campus. The 

 
 
We believe that our school should be the hub of our 
neighborhood. As a result, a high priority is placed on building and 
maintaining excellent facilities as economically as possible.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Frontier Elementary is committed to maintaining a safe school environment. The school is in compliance with all laws, 
rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state 
earthquake standards. Our School Safety Plan along 
with a School Crisis Intervention Plan is on file;  both are available to all parents as well as the general public. The Scho
ol 
Safety Plan is a District plan that encompasses all three schools in the Pion
eer Union Elementary School District.  The 
school plans are reviewed and updated under the direction of the District Safety Coordinator, Sharon Cronk, on an annual 
basis. The staff develops both plans with input from parents and community members to work t
o ensure a safe and non
-
violent environment on all of the PUESD campuses. Specific areas of focus, coupled with appropriate strategies to address 
concerns, are featured in our school plan. Key elements of the plan include Monthly safety drills that are pra
cticed with 
the students to ensure their understanding of all emergency procedures including, fire, earthquake, and intruder drills. 
Crisis intervention plans are also included in the safety plan.  Supervision is provided before, during, and after school w
ith 
campus yard aides and administration supervising students. All yard aides wear neon vests to remain visible to all students 
and visitors.  All aides also carry walkie talkies to ensure they  always have contact with the office in case of emergency. 
Eve
ry classroom is also equipped with a walkie talkie in order to ensure proper communication should other technological 
devices not function properly. Campus
-
wide supervision ensures students are safe on school grounds before, during, and 
after school. Entra
nces to school grounds are secured or monitored during the school day. A front gate at Frontier 
Elementary was recently moved forward to allow for a secure campus the entire school day. All visitors must sign in at the 
office and wear appropriate identific
ation while on campus.  The School Safety Plan is also published on the district 
website.
 
 
The district has formed a District Safety Plan Committee. This committee meets 2
-
3 times during the school year prior to 
January to review the plan and offer input. 
The Safety Plan Committee ensures that the plan meets state and federal 
requirements. The committee members include: local law enforcement (School Resource Officer), site teacher 
representatives, the Classified Union President, an administrator from each s
chool site, the MOT Director, local Fire 
Department representatives from both the city and county, and the district Superintendent. The committee keeps formal 
documentation for public review of the agendas and minutes.

At Frontier Elementary School (FES) we have several programs that help support struggling students and subgroups. Our 
EL students receive direct instruction with the English Language. FES also 
has supplemental funds that allows us to hire 
Supplemental Aides and two Title 1 Teachers. These aides and the specialized teachers support identified Title 1 students 
in both Mathematics and English Language Arts. FES also provides additional classroom su
pport with our Instructional 
Aides that work in small groups with students who are identified as academically at risk. In addition, this year we have 
implemented a Tier II 30 minute intervention block during the school day that targets specific skills that
 
student's need 
additional support in. Teachers meet in their Professional Learning Communities to analyze academic data and identify 
interventions. Students are grouped and the assigned a teacher that provides targeted instruction for 6 weeks. Students 
ar
e assessed and teachers analyze the data and regroup students based on the data and student academic need.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
All training and curriculum development at Pioneer Union Elementary School District 
revolves around the California 
Content Standards and Frameworks. During the 2017
-
20 school years, Frontier Elementary School held staff development 
days which covered Reading and Language Arts, Mathematics, and technology based curricula and instructional 
techniques to meet student need. Groundwork for the Multi
-
System of Support Services (MTSS) model was also 
established with both classroom teachers and Special Educational services team. Staff development topics and activities 
are determined through a coll
aborative effort of all teaching staff. Training needs are identified based upon assessment 
results, staff survey results, feedback from both teaching and administrative staff, and district wide goals.
 
 
Currently, all training and curriculum development at
 
Pioneer Union Elementary School District supports Common Core 
Standards instruction. Frontier Elementary holds quality staff development days which cover professional development 
in reading and language arts, mathematics,technology, and Professional Learn
ing Communities. Training topics and 
activities are determined through a collaborative effort of all teaching staff. Training needs are identified based upon 
assessment results, staff survey results, Staff Meetings, and the school site plan. Staff training
s and support is provided 
through after school workshops, in service staff professional development days, release time to observe colleagues, and 
release time for grade level planning.Frontier Elementary School provided training for our supplementary progr
ams to 
follow up on our core curricular programs. Frontier teachers participated in training on State Standards, Google Classroom, 
and other new Technology programs that they can utilize for classroom instruction.
 
 
During the Language Arts Curriculum and G
uided Reading professional development, teachers had full days of training 
and coaching in the classroom that extended the entire school year.  Staff also received training in the newly adopted 
Benchmark Advance Comprehensive Reading/Language Arts Curricul
um to further implement Guided Reading and Shared 
Reading in every classroom. During the 18
-
19 school year, teachers are continuing to receive professional development in 
the area of Shared Reading. The district has contracted with a Benchmark Advanced Con
sultant who provides instructional 
support for teachers through direct instruction, guided practice, modeling lessons, etc. During the 19
-
20 school year, 
Frontier staff received professional development in the areas of math (Number Talk), writing (Benchmar
k Advance), 
Google training, and science.

During the 18
-
19 school year, the district received a grant with a focus on building a strong Multi
-
Tiered System of Support 
(MTSS) in each of the three schools that make up PUESD. FES currently has a site team th
at completed a Fidelity Integrity 
Assessment (FIA) that identifies areas of improvement with regard to Academic Instruction, Social
-
Emotional well
-
being, 
and School
-
Connectedness. The FIA team is currently working towards identifying goals and developing a
 
plan that lays 
out specific actions that will be taken in order to reach the identified goals. During the 19
-
20 school year, Frontier 
implemented a "Walk to Learn" 30 minute differentiated support block in which all students participate in. This block 
ide
ntifies specific skills that students need additional support in. Students are placed in fluid groups and assigned a teacher 
that will provide the differentiated support. Teachers progress monitor and administer assessments. After 6 weeks, data 
is collecte
d, analyzed, and students are placed in groups for another 6 weeks of differentiated support.
 
 
Frontier Elementary School keeps abreast of new teaching strategies and technology through the use of release time for 
grade level meetings, and in
-
service exper
iences. Early student dismissal on Wednesdays also provides teachers an 
additional 90 minutes weekly to collaborate and articulate with other grade levels. Frontier Elementary School works in 
conjunction with Pioneer Union Elementary School District to foc
us on specific areas of study and to improve instructional 
practices, address areas needing improvement, and implement new programs for improved student learning.
 
 
FES is working to lay the foundation for true Professional Learning Communities (PLC) since 
this is a priority this year and 
staff is participating in training in that area as well including full days for grades 3
-
5 throughout the year. Twice a month, 
teachers at Frontier Elementary School focused on classroom planning and group/subject area meet
ings to develop a 
Professional Learning Community at our school to increase student success and improve instruction.. The remaining two 
days were used for district wide collaboration and articulation; teachers from the middle and elementary schools gather 
in groups by subject area to share instructional strategies, evaluate curricular programs, discuss classroom practices, and 
address training needs.
