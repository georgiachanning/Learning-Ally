Abou
t the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the 
Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities
 
to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional inform
ation about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Greg Rogers (East) was built in 1962 and Greg Rogers (West) in 1963. We were remodeled in the summer of 2004 with a completio
n date of September 
2004. There are 35 classes serving our students' educati
onal needs. The school has an administrative wing of offices, a multipurpose room, kitchen, 
adaptive physical education room, a sensory room, and a therapeutic swimming pool.
 
 
Classroom space at our school is adequate to support our school's current enroll
ment.  The District maintains a planned program, which ensures routine 
maintenance functions are performed on a scheduled basis. Custodial staff performs basic cleaning operations daily. None of t
he eight emergency 
facilities needs specified in Education C
ode Section 17592.72 (c)(1) exist at our school.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

Research shows a high correlation between parent involvement and effective schools.  Greg Rogers School has an active Parent
-
Teacher Ass
ociation 
(PTA), which sponsors many projects for the benefit and welfare of the children.
 
 
The School Site Council plays an integral part in the programs and activities of the school by providing direction to staff o
n most site decisions and on the 
School 
Site Plan. All students are encouraged to contribute to their community and their school, thus our Student Council participat
es in fundraising 
activities such as Jumprope For Heart, food drives and toy collections.
 
 
During the school year, a series of work
shops are offered to parents through training opportunities and through English Language Advisory Committee 
meetings that included sessions on Social Emotional Learning, Positive Behaviors and Supports, and state and local measures t
esting information. To 
address the Wellness Policy the school holds Special Olympics on a yearly basis.  Parents, students, and community volunteers
 
participate in activities 
geared towards a healthy, active lifestyle for all.

practice procedures for each location on campus to ensure a safe campus for all.  We have also tightened up our dismissal pro
cedure this year to ensure 
that all gates are locked 10 minutes after the bell rings to b
etter secure the campus at the end of the day.  Our school safety committee regularly updates 
and refines our safety procedures. The Safety Plan was approved in October 2019 by our Site Council.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Staff members at Greg Rogers understand the importance of quality instruction.  Grade level collaboration meetings and profes
sional development assist 
teachers in coordinating instructional strategies to maximize effectiveness.  Professional Development is
 
also obtained through Professional Learning 
Cycles where teachers go through a cycle of training, safe practice, peer observation, and revision.  At Rogers, we are imple
menting, Wilda Storm writing 
strategies across all grade levels.  This is a solid rese
arch
-
based program providing many common core instructional strategies.  Wilda in conjunction with 
district
-
adopted curriculum provides balanced literacy and increases overall school performance for all students.  Based on the analys
is of our data, our 
Ins
tructional Leadership Team determined that our focus for professional development would be on Visible Learning including teac
her clarty in Math, 
and Collaborative Conversations.  We are also continuing our learning this year around Social Emotional Learnin
g.  Professional development is provided 
in many ways including during teacher collaboration, staff development days/times, and sometimes off
-
site. Implementation of professional 
development is supported by in
-
class coaching, peer observations within the p
rofessional learning cycle, and walkthroughs.
