About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Parents and community members are an integral part of Christa McAuliffe School and have a positive impact on the overall succ

volunteers can be seen coming and going in the halls, classrooms, workroo

activities, assist in the computer lab, tutor students, and provide clerical assistance.  Many parents participate in the PTO
, School Site Council, or District 
Advisory Councils. Ro
ughly 50 volunteers contribute more than 172 hours of support to the school each week.  We welcome parent participation in ou
r 
school activities and encourage parents to join our PTO and School Site Council. We also encourage parents to visit our Web s

at 
www.mcauliffe.oside.us and to participate in our numerous school activities throughout the academic year.

School Safety Plan
 
McAuliffe School has a safe environment and all visitors are required to check in at the office before entering the campus an
d receive a badge to wear 
th
roughout their stay. The school has adopted Positive Behavior Intervention Strategies (PBIS), which encourages positive reinf
orcement and behaviors. 
The campus remains secured during the school day. A team of staff, students, community, and local police up
dates the Safe School Plan annually. Our 
goals include training/practicing for crisis response, ensuring that the staff and students are prepared in a crisis situatio
n.  We conduct monthly 
fire/earthquake drills and other exercises with our school resource
 
officer.  Twice a year, Oceanside Police Department, in collaboration with Oceanside 
Unified Risk Management department, hold a mock disaster drill to confirm that all staff and students are well prepared in th
e event of an actual 
emergency.  After disast
er drills, we debrief to determine the areas in need of improvement.

Teachers and staff are provided regular and on
-
going professional development opportunities at the site, district and county level.  In addition, all 
teachers participate in monthly professional development activities organized during regularly scheduled s
taff meetings.  Staff also participate in 
professional development workshops organized by Oceanside Unified School District and/or the San Diego County Office of Educa
tion.
 
 
Teachers and staff attend these professional development workshops to improve thei
r teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of grade appropriate 
subject matter.   The primary focus for professional development is on understanding how to implement the Common Core State S
tandards (CCSS).  This 
includes working on developing a Balanc
ed Literacy Program, small group Guided Reading and related assessments, Benchmark Advance English 
Language Arts curriculum, the Lucy Caulkins Writing program and our Go
-
Math program.
 
 
In addition, we provide professional development on effective uses of t
echnology, including the use of i
-
Pads and our 140 Chrome Books for instruction.  
All staff are working to obtain their certification in Digital Citizenship. We currently have 1:1 Chrome Books in 5th grade a
nd soon will have them in all 
grade levels. Lastl
y, we are addressing the 4Cs of the 21st Century Skills which include Creativity, Critical Thinking, Collaboration and Commun
ication.
 
 
A
ll teachers are provided planning time twice a month to work with their grade level teams to discuss student results and data
, curriculum and instruction 
and next steps to ensure all students are learning.  The principal supports teachers with reflections 
from classroom observations regarding their 
instruction and Common Core implementation.
