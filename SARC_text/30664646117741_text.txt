By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Tijeras Creek is committed to developing a learning environment that encourages scholarly attributes and the pursuit of 
lifelong learning through a partnership of sch
ool, home, and community. We believe that children need a safe learning 
environment that promotes academic risk
-
taking, mutual respect, and personal pride. In order to help ensure that all 
students are college and career ready in literacy and mathematics, 
we must implement a rigorous standards
-
based 
curriculum and the use of exemplary teaching methods that meet the needs of all learners.
 
 
The school offers research
-
based instructional programs designed to ensure that all students master a solid educational 
foundation of basic skills within each subject area and apply these skills in challenging academic learning activities. At 
Tijeras Creek Elementary School, educators begin with the state standards to determine the essential understandings for 
each grade le
vel. Each student is challenged to progress in these standards to achieve academic excellence. Educators 
facilitate an active and supportive learning environment by collaborating with colleagues and by ongoing evaluation of 
student work and assessment resu
lts. Student learning is stimulated by using problem
-
solving, critical, and creative 
thinking skills. Students learn through differentiated activities and have opportunities for student choice. Working as a 
team, staff, parents, and the community assist al
l Tijeras Creek students to become contributing members of society by 
empowering them with the skills, knowledge, and values necessary to excel in a changing world.
 
 
Tijeras Creek draws 367 transitional kindergarten, through fifth grade students from the c
ommunities of Dove Canyon, 
Coto de Caza, and Rancho Santa Margarita. There is also a fee based and state funded preschool which is available for 
students from our  surrounding communities. The highly qualified staff is comprised of 13 caring, enthusiastic,
 
and 

ty 

 
 
Teachers utilize differentiation strategies for all learners. TC teachers integrate engagement strategies into their lessons 
to ensure that students meet the learning objectives of their lessons.   At Tijeras Creek,  teachers recognize the need to 
tailor 
learning environments and practices to create appropriately different learning experiences for students based on 
individual needs, abilities, and interests. Curriculum differentiation is utilized to meet the individual needs of the schola
rs 
in the class.  
Teachers employ an array of instructional strategies such as grouping students by readiness and by interest. 
Learning centers, enrichment activities, curriculum compacting, and flexible groupings are all tools teachers use to meet 
the needs of all students
. Teachers regularly use the thinking tools of depth and complexity to deepen their students' 
understanding of content areas.

The Common Core State Standards provide the educational foundation at Tijeras Creek. A comprehensive language arts 
program is 
integrated throughout all subject areas with a specific focus on reading comprehension. Teachers provide 
instruction in phonemic awareness, decoding skills, and comprehension skills in well
-
balanced instructional programs. The 
"Comprehension Toolkit" is us

through the use of nonfiction text. Students read a wide variety of high quality and engaging reading materials such as 
Junior Great Books, literature books, leveled
 
guided reading books, Time for Kids and National Geographic Explorer 
magazines.  Scholastic Reading Inventory is used by primary and upper grade teachers to monitor student growth in 
reading comprehension. The Scholastic Reading Counts incentive program a

appropriate lexile range and complete comprehension quizzes to earn points.  Through this tool students have the 

 
language arts 
program and is guided by the Common Core Standards. Teachers have attended extensive training in the Write From the 
Beginning and Beyond program.    All students learn mathematics in a balanced curriculum based on the Common Core 
frameworks 
while utilizing the Envision math program along with other supplemental materials.    Lessons include the 
perfect balance of basic skills and problem
-
solving instruction as a means of ensuring that all students meet or exceed 
grade level math performance s
tandards. TC students participate in a comprehensive science program which includes   
balance of physical, earth, and life science content. Tijeras Creek teachers have committed to a two year partnership with 
Discovering Education.  The partnership kicked 
off in the fall of 2017.  Through  this partnership the Tijeras Creek staff 
received ongoing  training in the philosophy surrounding STEM and connecting STEM to NGSS and the Language Arts 
program being utilized at Tijeras Creek.  Scholars at Tijeras Creek 
begin coding as young as TK.  Spheros and coding mice 
are available to provide in the Makerspace to provide scholars the opportunity to code.  Our goal is to provide a strong 
academic program with an emphasis on high student achievement. A Lego wall was re
cently added to our Makerspace to 
assist in fostering creativity and engineering skills.

Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Tijeras Creek, 
parent participation is evidenced through a large volunteer program. Parents provide many volunteer 
hours in the classrooms, library, and computer lab.  Volunteering parents can be found assisting individuals, working with 
small groups of children, assisti
ng scholars in the computer lab, checking out library books, reading with students,  
monitoring students as they work independently or completing clerical work for the classroom teacher. Our highly 
supportive Parent Teacher Association (PTA) works hand
-
in
-
hand with the school to provide funds for programs which 
further enrich the school experience for our scholars. At Tijeras Creek we foster a strong partnership of school, home, and 
the community through continual home/school communication, parent and commu
nity volunteers, parent education 
programs, an active PTA, and the seeking of business connections. Our PTA sponsored Family Fun Nights and parent 
education nights to help build a strong sense of community. Parent volunteers organize and  run a  Book Fair 
for our 
scholars, which is a fundraiser and provides high quality books for students to purchase.   Our PTA events are publicized 
in the weekly electronic "Tijeras Creek Times" and on our school website. In addition, teachers post information about 
classro
om events and classroom assignments on their individual websites that can be accessed by parents at home 
through our school website. Phone calls are also made directly to the homes in our community to help keep our 
community informed of all school activiti
es.   Go to http://tces.capousd.ca.schoolloop.com/ to find out more about our 
school and an activities.  Our generous PTA funds  on site programs/assemblies for every grade level that support the 
Common Core standards.   Our weekly music classes for Transi
tional Kindergarten, Kindergarten, first,  second, and third 
grade scholars as well as a hands
-
on Science program are funded by our PTA.   This dynamic group of parent volunteers 
works side by side with the principal to fund staff development to support st
udent engagement, math training and higher 
level thinking.  The PTA  purchases supplemental reading materials, computers for our library, a  computer lab with 34 
computers, maintains the yearly fees for our web based supplemental programs, purchases playgr
ound equipment and 
much more. They also sponsor our school play. They assist our scholars to expand their knowledge base by exposing them 

nic 
garden and maintain safety and disaster supplies for our school. Each year the Boy Scouts, Eagle Scouts, and Girl Scouts 
have donated their time and played a role in various school beautification projects.  Tijeras Creek also has a Booster Club 
that su
pports fundraising to offset the costs of 5th grade Science Camp.  The Booster Club also assists in fundraising for 
Instructional Assistants who provide support and extension activities in the classrooms. Finally, the Education for the 
Children Foundation 
gives our school an average of $9,000/year for grants written by teachers.  Parents are involved in all 
of these organizations.

Capistrano Unified School District places great value on the role of professional learning, and utilizes systems
-
wide 
structures and strategies to promote continuous learning of adults 
that result in increased learning for students.  The 
ongoing focus for professional learning is to support the district's Wildly Important Goal for Teaching and Learning.  It is 
the district goal to engage students in meaningful, challenging, and innovativ
e educational experiences to increase post
-
secondary options for all students.
 
 
It is the goal of  Capistrano Unified School District to ensure all students receive Great First Instruction (GFI).  The visi
on 
for GFI is that all learning environments includ
e Lesson Preparation, Interaction, Strategies, and Review and Assessment 
as defined by the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP).  By design, the model for providing professional 
learning is multi
-
tiered, and ranges from large
-
scale, district
-
w
ide learning opportunities focused on priority areas to site
-
specific, embedded professional learning (including coaching) that supports teachers in the transfer of that learning to the 

lemental training during the summer and after 
school hours to further support district initiatives and teacher needs for ongoing professional learning. The outcome of all 
CUSD professional learning is to improve educator effectiveness in order to increase 
student learning. In support of this 
outcome, administrators participate in professional learning to increase their knowledge of quality practices, California 
Content Standards, and strategies for instructional leadership.
 
 
Since 2004, all schools provide 
specific release time for embedded professional learning using late start or early release 
days.  In grades K
-
8, this time is known as ACE time (Articulation and Collaboration for Excellence).  The purpose of this 
time is for educators to examine the impac
t of their practice on student learning, with a focus on continuous improvement.  
Schools work to identify key areas of learning based on an analysis of student data, upon which they place their focus for 
professional learning and set annual measurable goa
ls based upon those identified areas of need. These areas are 
determined through the analysis of student learning data from multiple sources, including, but not limited to high stakes 
testing. The action plan developed to accomplish these goals outlines pr
iorities for teacher training and implementation.

Throughout the year, the structure of collaboration typically involves teacher teams engaging in ongoing examination of 
standards
-
based curriculum, the examination of meaningful formative and summative ass
essment data, and powerful 
teaching strategies that get results in student learning. In 2017 the District developed the CUSD Professional Learning 

ze Common 
Goals, Relational Trust, Focus on Learning, Shared Responsibility, Action
-
Oriented, Data Driven, and Systems and 
Structures for Support  to ensure all students are learning at high levels.  These embedded professional learning activities 
help pre
pare teams to provide a differentiated instructional program that meets the needs of all students.
 
 
Beginning teachers receive systematic training and support during their first two years of teaching within the CUSD 
Induction Program. This program assists 
new teachers as they build upon the skills they already possess upon entering the 
field of teaching, and provides them with support from a veteran teacher. The program is approved by the California State 
Commission on Teacher Credentialing and meets the re

to those activities previously described, all teachers may receive support, assistance, and opportunities to grow 
professionally through their participation in school site learning teams, st
udent study teams, from district resource 
teachers, and the Peer Assistance and Review Program.
