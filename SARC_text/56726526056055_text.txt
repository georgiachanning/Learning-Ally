STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT
The California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) System 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments (SBAC) for students in the general 
education population, and the California Alternate Assessments (CAAs) for students with 

administration of the CAAs.  CAAs items are aligned with alternative achievement 
standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  CAASPP 
results are a measure of how well students are mastering California™s standards in English 
language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics, and are given to grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. SBAC tests assess student performance in ELA/Literacy and 
mathematics utilizing computer-adaptive tests and performance tasks, and CAAs test items 
are aligned with alternative achievement standards which are linked with the Common Core 
State Standards (CCSS). 
The CAASPP results shown in this report include overall results comparing the school, district 
and state scores as well as the school™s overall score in each applicable subgroup. Results 
are shown only for subgroups with ten students or more taking the exam. For those categories 
that are blank in the tables, no students met subgroup criteria. More information on CAASPP
