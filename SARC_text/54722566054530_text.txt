By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School 
Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Conyer Elementary School takes great efforts to ensure a safe, clean, and functional physical environment for students, 
staff, and volunteers. Sufficient space is provided for students and 
staff to support teaching and learning. This includes 
space provided by classrooms, playgrounds, and staff work rooms. To assist our school in this effort, the district uses a 
facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public
 
School Construction. The results of this 
survey are available at the district office. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be 
obtained by speaking with the school principal.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance
 
staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
In 2014
-
15
, major maintenance and repair projects included new roofing of all of the corridors.
 
 
In addition to custodial staff on duty during the school day, a team of maintenance specialists come in after hours for daily
 
cleaning. District and school maintenance s
taff work cooperatively with administrators to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Program
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a 
dollar for dollar basis to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school build
ing 
components.  Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
pa
inting, and floor systems. The deferred maintenance program ensures that all class¬¨rooms and facilities are maintained 
to a degree of adequacy that allows for a good learning environment.
 
 
Facilities Improvements
 
During the 2014
-
15 school year the playgrou
nd equipment was updated and ADA requirements for handicap access was 
updated.  (A wheelchair access path was created from the front of campus to the structure.  Railings were added to 
drinking fountains and to bathroom stalls.)

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California
 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [
ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State St
andards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univer
sity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

to involve parents by sharing information that helps parents understand and support school programs and by providing 
opportunities for parent participation in s
chool activities.
 
 
There are numerous and varied opportunities for parent involvement, including but not limited to, attending school 
functions, participating in parent
-
teacher conferences, volunteering in classrooms/library, and chaperoning field trips. 
P
arents may also serve on advisory committees and leadership teams such as, the English Learners Advisory Committee 
(ELAC), School Safety Committee, School Site Council (SSC), Positive Behavior Intervention and Support (PBIS) team, and 
the Parent Teacher As
sociation (PTA) . Conyer offers classes to parents on site, three afternoons a week through the Visalia 
Adult School as well to help them attain their GED or learn English.  Additional opportunities for parental involvement also 
exist at the district level
.

Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Conyer Elementary School. Campus
-
wide supervision ensures students 
are safe on school grounds before, during, and after school. Entrances to school grounds are secured
  
during the school 
day.   All visitors must enter through the office, sign in at the office, and wear appropriate identification while on campus
. 
Conyer Elementary School is a single access entry point campus.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is desi
gned to assist in maintaining a safe school environment and preparing for 
emergencies. The plan requires identification of security needs, development of prevention and intervention techniques, 
evaluation of physical facilities, and communication with staf
f and students. The safety plan is reviewed annually, updated 
as needed, and fully compliant with federal and state regulations. An updated copy is available to the public at the school 
office.  The plan was reviewed and updated by the school staff and the
 
School Site Council in November of 2019.

with implementation fidelity, and during the 2017
-
2018 school year, TIER 3 supports. The Conyer PBIS

The following areas of professional development have been provided to staff: Professional Learning Communities (PLCs), 
Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) and Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS), Career 
Technical 
Education (CTE) High Quality pathway development, CTE Project
-
Based Learning (PBL), CTE Work
-
Based Learning (WBL), 
and effective math and literacy instruction and other areas as indicated by school data.  Our district provides professional 
develo
pment based on data from both the district and school level to ensure that areas of need are being addressed.  
Professional Development occurs at the district, school and classroom level dependent on teacher goals.   The district 
provides Teachers on Speci
al Assignment (TOSA) in Math, Science, Literacy, and Social Science to provide onsite coaching 
and support after professional development has occurred.
 
 
Support for Novice Teachers:  Due to a shortage of highly qualified teachers in our area, twenty percen


challenge and in compliance with the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, Visalia Unified offers a robust
 
support and training system for these novice educators including differentiated professional development and continuous 
professional growth opportunities.  The professional learning system begins with the New Certificated Staff Summer 
Institute which is a
 
five
-
day interactive training offered in August one week before school begins.  This training covers 
classroom management, classroom culture, curriculum frameworks, and lesson design. In addition, a four
-
day workshop 
on student engagement and cooperative 
learning is offered during winter break so that teachers may implement new 
structures and strategies during the spring semester.  All novice teachers receive ongoing support and individualized 
training throughout the year via weekly meetings with their ass
igned mentor at their respective school sites.  Mentors 
and district teachers
-
on
-
assignment support implementation of new knowledge by providing in
-
class coaching, 
collaborating on lesson design, accompanying novice teachers on classroom tours, and assisti
ng with student data analysis 
to drive instructional decisions.  In addition, novice teachers and their mentors attend monthly after school training in 
action research and are provided time to reflect on their instructional practice.   Mentors and teachers
 
on assignment are 
carefully selected experienced educators trained in how to facilitate the individualized professional growth of novice 
teachers.  Novice teachers who have preliminary credentials participate in the VUSD Teacher Induction Clear Credential
 
Program which is accredited by the Commission and is offered at no cost to the candidate.
 
 
Support for Veteran Teachers:  Veteran teachers in need of classroom management assistance also have access to one
-
on
-
one mentor support as may be needed in the cas
e of a new grade level assignment or challenging class.  Visalia Unified 
also offers a Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) program which is a formal system of mentoring and accountability.
