By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General: The district places a
 
strong emphasis on ensuring that all schools are safe, clean, environmentally friendly, 
mechanically functional and inviting for students, staff members, and the community. To assist in this effort, the district 
utilizes Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) dev
eloped by the State of California OPSC and local operations department developed 
inspection survey methods to keep facilities in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. The 
district regularly inspects and reviews the condition 
of the school facilities and surrounding grounds. The district places 
the highest priority on those safeguards that impact the fire, life and safety protection of the students, staff, and school 
buildings. Below is more specific information on the conditio
n of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students 
are provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School Buildings: Vinci Park was opened in 1974. This school has 32 regular classrooms, a multipurpose room, a 
library, and an administration building. In addition to the main building, there are six portable classrooms that have been 
added to accommodate class size reduction, to include two daycare centers, and after school community programs.
 
 
Maintenance and Rep
air: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order system process is used to ensure efficient service and 
highest priority is given to emerge

in good working order. This site also had interior and exterior lighting upgrades completed through Prop. 39 initiatives in 
identified areas throughout the campus.
 
 
Clea
ning Process and Schedule: The district has developed cleaning standards and schedules for all schools in the district. 
A summary of these standards and schedules is available at the school or the Maintenance & Operations office. The 
principal, with the gu
idance of the maintenance supervisor works daily with the custodial team to ensure that the cleaning 
standards are met, and that classrooms, restrooms, and campus grounds are kept clean, safe, and well
-
maintained.

Modernization Projects: During the 2016 s
ummer period, local bond funds (Measure L) were used to complete various 
modernization projects. These projects included installation of new flooring, replacement classroom furniture, painting of 
identified interior/exterior spaces throughout the campus, n
ew fencing, installation of new AV equipment and the 
construction of a Flexible Instructional Space.
 
 
All work described will be completed during the 2018/19 school year.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We update our school safety plan each year. Every classroom has a bin with 
emergency supplies and takes part in monthly 
fire and disaster drills. Teachers monitor the playground for 15 minutes before school. The school/PTA  newsletter alerts 
parents about safety and traffic concerns, and assemblies educate students on topics such
 
as child abduction prevention, 
helmet and fire safety. Additionally, through out the year, we have assemblies that focus on career awareness and healthy 
living, such as physical education, drug and alcohol
-
free lives!

Individual school sites offer Supplemental Instruction (SI) to students who are below grade level. It is up to each individua
l 
school sit e to identify the students who need extra support based upon district benchmarks or teacher recommendations. 
Each school site selects certificated and classified staff to teach these SI classes, usually after school (1 

 
3 days a week). 
Each sch
ool also identifies the curriculum that will be used. The majority of the school sites select computer

programs w here students can work independently at their current academic level. Some schools provide this time to 
receive help on their homework.

Professional Development this school year occurred on many different levels 

 
before school started (summer of 2019) 
and ongoing throughout the 2019 

 
2020 
school year.  The district office working with our site principals and curriculum 
leadership teams developed the scope/sequence of the professional development.  Leadership teams reviewed student 
data produced from benchmark tests, ELPAC, and SBAC data, as
 
well as staff feedback when developing the scope and 
sequence.
 
 
At the beginning of the school year, all certificated and classified staff participated in two days of professional 
development aligned to their instructional role and needs.  TK
-
5 teachers r
eceived training on providing effective Tier 1 
instruction in math and ELA.  Special education staff, social workers and psychologists received training on topics pertinent
 
to their needs such as All Learning is Social Emotional, TCI De
-
Escalation, Instruc
tional Scaffolding to Assist and Support 
Student , and Data Collection and Behavior Management.  Middle school staff received specialized training related to the 
content they teach, that focused on the social emotional element of learning as well as recent
ly adopted curriculum.  All 
middle school teachers participated in a workshop on understanding gender.  Training for new teachers focused on 

h their 
certificated colleagues in order to have the opportunity to collaborate while learning.  They also attended other sessions 
designed to meet their specific professional needs.
 
 
During the school year middle school, science teachers were released up 
to three days to collaborate on implementation 
of the new science program.  Middle school math and writing teachers scored and/or analyze student benchmarks during 
release days for each grade.  7th grade science teachers were released for 1
-
2 days for trai

comprehensive sexuality program.  Additional training was offered on release day for special education teachers to 
support implementation of our dyslexia curriculum as well as special education components of our ELA programs.

Throug
hout the school year, we offered monthly professional development sessions in which all teachers participated (1.5 
hours on 10 early release Thursday afternoons).  Principals and district office administrators chose the topics for the 2019
-
2020 school year
 
in alignment with the District focus on developing a multi
-
tiered system of support.
 
 
The Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL) program was implemented at six of our ten elementary schools in grades TK
-
3.  The schools included were Cherrywood, Laneview, 
Summerdale, Brooktree, Toyon and Vinci Park.   Teachers in the first 
two years of implementation received three two
-
day training modules each followed by a day of unit planning.  Teachers 
in the third and fourth year of implementation participated in three
 
days of unit planning.  Contracted SEAL experts 
provided the module training sessions and three district instructional coaches facilitated the follow up planning PD 
sessions.  Teachers were released from their classrooms for all of these PD days.
 
 
Four in
structional coaches provided BTSA induction training for all teachers who qualified to receive BTSA training and 
support. Additionally, BUSD teachers provide PAR assistance to teachers who are in need of additional assistance.  All 
teachers have access to 
an instructional coach so that they can receive follow up support on implementing new learning 
attended through professional development.
 
 
An MTSS committee and Differentiated Assistance Team received 3
-
5 days of training on change management facilitated 
b
y WestEd and the Santa Clara County Office of Education.  Some members also participated in 3 training sessions of 
equity.  Team members then trained principals during monthly professional development meetings.   The focus of both 
teams aligned with the di
strict goal of developing multi
-
tiered systems of support at each site.
