Special Education/ISSSchool Accountability Report Card 
for School Year 2018-2019
Published in 2019-2020
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by 
state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The 

SARC contains information about the condition and performance of 

each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula 

(LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a 

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they 

intend to meet annual school-specific goals for all pupils, with specific 

activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported 

in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported in the SARC. . 
 For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC Web page at 
http://www.cde.

ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF 

Web page at 
http://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 

community members should contact the school principal or the district 

office.
DataQuestDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest Web 
page at http://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional informa
-
tion about this school and comparisons of the school to the district, the 

county, and the state. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that 

provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school 

graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding 

English learners.
Internet AccessInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that 
are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the 

Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-

come, first-served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of 

operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 

on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, 

and the ability to print documents.

ABOUT THIS SCHOOL2 School Accountability Report Card for School Year 2018-2019
Mission Statement (School Year 2019-20)
Juniper™s mission is to create a positive and active campus culture where students are learning to think and 
thinking to learn.
A Message from the Principal . . .
Juniper School is the home of the Jaguars, where students are given opportunities daily to explain their thinking 
in a meaningful way.  Juniper™s motto is that all students are ﬁLearning to think and thinking to learn.ﬂ Our staff is 
dedicated to our students™ success and their future. Our emphasis on academic excellence and our journey to col
-
lege begins with us. Juniper provides a comprehensive Language Arts program that emphasizes comprehension and 

writing.  Students are taught using the core literature each day and are focused on learning the grade level Common 

Core Standards.  The children are given multiple opportunities to practice both Reading and Writing throughout 

the day in all content areas. To incorporate critical thinking skills and ready our students for higher education and 

the new world work force, Juniper™s focus has been and will continue to be creating opportunities for all students 

to be able to explain their thinking across all content areas and encouraging student collaboration.  As a staff, we 

have also worked hard through planning and professional development to incorporate technology into our lessons 

to help students explain their thinking and think critically.  Teachers work hard daily to create these opportunities 

in a meaningful way. Mathematics instruction is provided through a balanced approach, which teaches problem 

solving, computation, critical thinking, and application of Math concepts aligned with the grade level standards. 

Technology and 21st Century Learning is incorporated in all grade levels including one to one iPads for students 

in grades Kindergarten through fifth. Juniper also provides all students enrichment opportunities throughout the 

school year with activities such as our awarding winning student led newscast PAWS, school gardening club, coding, 

ASB program, math enrichment, music programs, inter-murals, STEM activities, and student musicals.   
Parent involvement is a priority for us here at Juniper and there are multiple opportunities for parents to get 
involved with our Jaguar community.  Through our English Learner Advisory Council or School Site Council, par
-ents can give formal input about issues that affect our students, and ways to spend our funding to improve student 

achievement.  More informal opportunities are also available for parents through PTA, Parent Universities, Coffee 

with the Principal, Family Lunch and Learns, family activities outside of school hours, or as classroom volunteers.  

It is our goal, here at Juniper, that every family is involved with our school in some way.  We are also very proud 

of our community and business partners, including our continued partnership with Jimbo™s, Panda Express, Major 

Market, The Children™s Museum, UCSD, Cal State San Marcos, Kona Ice, Rubio™s, Chic-Fil-A, California Pizza 

Kitchen, and Vons.  It is also a great pleasure to have such wonderful organizations such as the Assistance League 

and the Rotary Club work with us on a regular basis.

(School Year 2019Œ20)
 Juniper School Parent Teacher Association
 Œ Our PTA serves a very important function in ensuring our students™ 
success. They support our students and staff through activities including orgainizing evening events to promote 
active parent involvement, inviting authors of children™s books to speak, and Teacher Appreciation Day. They 

also provide generous financial support in a variety of areas.
 Classroom Volunteers - 
classroom volunteers support Juniper in many ways. Parents and volunteers work with 
certificated staff and assist them under their supervision in various ways.
 School Site Council 
meets regularly to review our school programs within our Single Plan for Student Achievement, 
Safe School Plan, and Technology Plan, and approve budgets for these programs and plans.
English Learner Advisory Council
 Œ Our ELAC serves as an advisory council for the many issues involving our 
students who are learning English.  They advise the School Site Council on budget and program issues, serve 

as liaisons to our Spanish speaking parents to inform them of the programs and assistance available for our 

English learners, offer suggestions for workshops, and advise the principal of topics that are important to those 

learning English and their families.  Family  Liaison
 helps to provide valuable information from the school to the parents, works closely with the prin
-cipal and ELAC to determine needs for families, offers parent educational nights on many topics, and provides 

translation during conferences and meetings.
Parent Universities/Lunch and Learns
- These are workshops that parents can attend to gain knowledge about how 
they can support their student at Juniper and move towards college readiness. 
Juniper is also represented on district committees such as DAC, DELAC and budget communications.
  Parents interested in getting involved are encouraged to call their child™s teacher, the Family Liaison, Mercedes 
Aguilar, or the principal, Brooke Cottingham, at (760) 432-2462.
