By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Hillsborough City School District inspects all of its facilities, both buildings and grounds, yearly to determine if any 
major repairs are needed. The District uses a facility ins

School Instruction. Inspection by Buildings and Grounds personnel of the eight emergency facility needs specified in Ed. 
Code 17592.72c was last completed November 2018. The results of th
is facility survey are available at the District Office. 
In addition, the school district maintains a work order process to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority. Work orders can be prepared by a staff member, o
r suggested by a parent. Work orders are 
prioritized district
-
wide by the Supervisor of Buildings and Grounds. The district maintenance staff ensures that repairs 
necessary to keep the schools in good working order are completed in a timely manner.
 
 
Curren
tly, all of our schools employ a full
-
time day custodian and a full
-
time night cleaning service. All classrooms, staff 
rooms and all student and staff restrooms are cleaned, and sanitized nightly. Cleaning schedules and duties are monitored 
regularly by th
e sites and the maintenance department to ensure safe and clean schools. On November 5, 2002, 
Hillsborough voters passed a $66.8 million Proposition 39 bond measure to finance renovation and new construction 
projects on all four campuses. The District has 
modernized, renovated, newly constructed and equipped housing to meet 
the instructional needs of the students. These funds, along with $2.8 million in State School Facilities funds, were used to 
upgrade fire, life, safety, and accessibility standards. In a
ddition to facilities, much needed upgrades were made to the 

 
 
A new building on the South campus opened at the start of the 2009
-
10 school year. Funded by Measure B bond funds, 
the building includes a multi

purpo
se room with stage, a warming kitchen, restrooms and storage areas. New playground 
equipment and play surfaces were installed and funded by the South Parent Group during the summers of 2009 and 2010. 
Also occurring during the summer of 2010 was the resurfa
cing of the tennis courts by Hillsborough Recreation.
 
 
The summer of 2015, the main entrance to the playground was reconfigured and landscaped. This included a new secure 
steel gate and brick pavers. Funding was provided by the South Parent Group. The summ

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority
: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Opportunities for parental involvement in the district and at the school site are abundant, and our parents have always 
given generously of their time, attention, and money. Their efforts mean far more than the material benefits they bring; 
they make our s
tudents and teachers feel valued and important. Such feelings contribute directly to our educational 
excellence. In the 2018
-
2019 school year, parents and other community volunteers contributed thousands of hours 
directly to South School in the classrooms,
 
in the library, helping with hot lunch, serving on committees, and assisting with 
special service and instructional projects and programs.
 
 
Parent volunteers shelve, check
-
out and check
-
in library books, serve as classroom volunteers, chaperones and docen
ts 
and help with many school events such as the STEAM Expo, Reading Tigers, Fathers and Friends Day, Multicultural Day 
and our community service and service learning projects. Through organizations such as the South Parent Group, the 
School Site Council, a
nd Parent Ed events, parents learn about activities and instructional programs at the school and set 
goals to raise student achievement and continually improve the education we provide to our students and their families.
 
 
At the district level, thousands o
f additional volunteer hours are given to fund
-
raising events, sponsored by the 
Hillsborough Schools Foundation, such as the general campaign, tennis luncheon, dinner dance, and e
-
Scrip program. The 
Hillsborough Schools Foundation provides funds annually t
o the district in order to enhance the already excellent

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety is our number one priority in the Hillsborough City School District school community. We focus on maintaining safe 
and caring school communities where all students and families feel welcome, valued, and respected.  When students feel 
safe at school 
they can focus on learning.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan, developed in conjunction with the San Mateo County Office of Education and City 
Services, includes disaster preparedness and emergency procedures, and provides the basic guidelines for resp
onsibilities 
and procedures needed to address major emergency situations.  This plan is updated and reviewed with staff annually.
 
HCSD has a District Safety Committee that meets a minimum of 5 times a year for planning and trainings.  The committee 
is comp
rised of two teachers per site, and two parents from each site.  The committee is responsible for keeping the 
Incident Command System organizational chart current, attend disaster preparedness trainings, and be the liaison 
between the District Safety Commi
ttee and Site Safety Committee.  At the site level, the Safety Committee is responsible 
for maintaining emergency backpacks for each classroom, inventorying the emergency shed, and reviewing Big Five 
Protocols with the staff.

The district expenditures from the general fund provide high quality educational programs for all students, including 
special populations such as Special Education and English Learners. All basic educational
 
needs such as instructional 
materials, personnel, staff development, technology, facilities, and maintenance are adequately funded. Federal and state 
funds are used appropriately and as required. Through additional funds supplied through the generosity of
 
our parents 
and the larger community, we are also able to provide lower class sizes, curriculum specialists, foreign language programs, 
additional counseling services, and other enhancements to programs. Resources are allocated based on the assessed 
learn
ing needs of students.

Each year the district offers training to its new teachers before the start of school and continues with specific new teacher
 
support for two full years, including participation in the BTSA (Beginning Teachers Support and Assessment) program. The 
district 
provides three full days of professional development for teachers each year (August, October, and March) and 
supports the continual professional growth of teachers in various ways. Teachers participate in off
-
site professional 
development opportunities on 
a regular basis, and expert coaches and consultants work with teachers, on
-
site as well.  
The district encourages veteran teachers to grow through its HIP (Hillsborough Incentive Plan) Program, and through 
providing support for teachers who wish to become 
Nationally Board Certified. Individual teachers are encouraged to take 
classes specific to their subject area in order to ensure they meet the requirements for NCLB certification as highly 
qualified teachers. Compliance training for certificated and classi
fied staff, such as CPR/First Aid, is held as needed. 
Specialists are also provided training relevant to their assignments, and training for all involved occurs any time new 
standards or materials are adopted.
 
 
By adding instructional minutes on other days
, Thursday afternoons are available for both school site and district staff 
development or collaborative work groups. This is in addition to the weekly teacher, grade
-
level, and/or departmental 
collaborative time. TOSAs (Teachers On Special Assignment) wer
e instituted District
-
wide to provide training for classroom 
teachers in the area of Technology Integration (2015
-
2016) and Math/Science support (2016
-
2017). Web Advisers, Data 
Advisers, and Curriculum Advisers /Lead Teachers, also support the furtherance 
of the school site and district
-
wide goals. 
The administration and staff maintain a mutual support system, with close communication and strong cooperative 
planning. For the 2018
-
2019 school year, a Science Advisor role and a part
-
time Educational Services 
TOSA are being 
utilized to support curriculum implementation and student growth.
 
 
During the 2018
-
2019 school year, the HCSD is providing professional development to teachers in the areas of 
Reading/Language Arts, Mathematics, and Science. Additional profe
ssional development opportunities will be provided 
as needs arise and change.

At South we hold professional development as a priority, and have strategies in place for communication and collaboration 
between and among colleag

schedules to allow opportunities to examine student work and assessment data to formulate differentiation strategies 
and coordinate curriculum. These collaborative o
pportunities are afforded as students work with specialists in music, 
physical education, Spanish and library science. Over the next two years, our professional development focused work in 
writing and reading will occur throughout the year. Thursday aftern
oons are relegated to cross
-
grade, multiple
-
grade, and 
vertical planning groupings wherein we will articulate best practices, share research
-
based strategies and plan to build 
alignment of our K
-
