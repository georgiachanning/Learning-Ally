Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Clara J. King School is located in the northwestern
-
most part of Orange County.  It has 573 students who attend TK through 
sixth grade and come from a very diverse community. Many students who attend King School have parents who grew up 
in Cypre
ss, and many also attended King School.   Our mission is simply stated yet very complex: We strive to meet the 
needs of Every Student, Every Moment, for Every Opportunity.  In order to achieve our mission, we continually explore 
ways to address how to best
 
help each of our students be an optimal learner and a well
-
adjusted child.
 
 
King is the only Title 1 school in the Cypress School District, with close to double the amount of socioeconomically 
disadvantaged students as the district average. King School ha
s programs that are unique because the needs of our 
students and families are different from those in the other schools in the Cypress School District: 59% of the 573 students 
who attend King School are economically disadvantaged; 27% of students at King S
chool speak a first language other than 
English.  Of the subgroups at King School, the largest is our Hispanic population that comprises 41% of students enrolled.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Site Council (SSC) is an advisory group that meets regularly to receive information, discuss school programs, 
and provide input toward school
-
based decision
-
making. The SSC is composed of the principal, three classroom teachers, 
one other school
 
staff member, and five parents of students. Per Education Code 52870, the English Learner Advisory 

public. Parents are encouraged to
 
attend Title 1 parent meetings, and parent education events at school, as well as our 
annual Back
-
to
-
School Night and Open House.
 
 
The school actively seeks parent involvement in school programs in a variety of ways:
 
 

 
Parent representation for the distric
t LCAP committee and district ELAC.
 

 
Parent representatives assist with our Class Act music program.
 

 
PTA supports the school program by encouraging and organizing parent involvement, promoting the self
-
esteem 
of students, and enriching the school program by
 
providing special programs, services, and activities.
 

 
A number of parents and community volunteers work in the classrooms assisting teachers and school staff in a 
variety of ways to effectively lower adult to student ratio.
 

 
Many volunteers assist in the o
ffice, library, computer lab, and other areas of the school as needed.
 

 
Parents accompany classes on field trips and with classroom incentives and special activities.
