About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publis
h a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a
 
Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent w
ith data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardi
ans and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Curriculum development is a district
-
wide effort. Teachers and administrators from all subject areas form working committees to draft recommendations 
on instructional materials.
 
 
The California Department of Education has determined t
extbook selection and adoption schedules. The district follows the state schedule for these 
adoptions and has purchased textbooks from the most recent state
-
approved lists. All approved instructional materials are aligned with California content 
standards 
for core academic areas.
 
 
The Elementary School District Curriculum Advisory Council reviews curriculum recommendations and revisions materials utilize
d in the support of the 
instructional program. The Curriculum Council recommendations are forwarded to th
e Board of Education for final approval. This is an ongoing process, 
assuring that all textbooks and instructional materials are systematically reviewed, updated, and supplemented.
 
 
This table shows some of the textbooks used with grade K

site 
supervision is provided for programs that 
take place before and after school. The principal, teachers, and other staff serve as yard duty supervisors. In addition, stu
dents are trained as conflict 
managers and junior coaches. We also take further measures 
to ensure student safety after school. These measures include the Learning Enrichment 

 
 
District and school policy require that during the school day all guests to the cam

them for security personnel and all staff and students.
 
 
The physical quality of the school campus influences teaching and learning. All students and faculty have a reasonable amount
 
of classroom and open 
space.
 
 
Bahia Vista Elementary School was established in 1966, and completely rebuilt in 2005
-
2006 with voter
-
approved school bond funds, state modernization 
funds, and other capital facilities funds. The new facility is comprised of
 
a two
-
story building and includes 21 classrooms, a multipurpose facility with a 
commercial kitchen, a library, technology center, space for educational support programs, and a student services (administrat
ion) building. The campus 
also includes three new 
playground areas for kindergarten, primary, and upper
-
level students, as well as a soccer field and new parking areas. The district 
strives to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. All bathrooms, classrooms, and offices are cleaned daily
. Students are encouraged to 
help keep the campus clean by recycling. District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in 
good repair and working 
order are completed in a timely manner. An online maintenance order request pr
ocess is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.

Bahia Vista Elementary School has a comprehensive school safety plan covering all aspects of planning for emergency response 
and student safety. This 
plan is based on and coordinated with the district and county emergency preparedness plans. The plan is re
viewed with school staff at the start of the 
school year. The plan is updated annually to increase preparedness for any emergency, including storms, fire, earthquake, or 
intruders on campus. All 
staff members have been trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitat
ion (CPR) and first aid. Disaster drills are held once a semester throughout the year to 
prepare students in the event of such emergencies. In addition, the school participates in a county
-
wide disaster preparedness drill annually.
 
 
Key elements of the sch
ool safety plan include: procedures during emergencies, safety drills, emergency supplies, first aid, and updated phone numbe
rs 
for city and emergency services.
