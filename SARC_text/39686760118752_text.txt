instructional day. We continue to grow
 
our collection of library books each year, to ensure that our students 
have access to multiple genres and endless choice of titles to enjoy.
 
 
We also continue to build strong collaboration and partnerships with our parents and families of the students 
we 
teach. Your involvement and participation is needed and valued. Communication is a vital component to 
the success of our students. School wide communication folders go home each Wednesday and weekly 
information can be found in this communicator, our websit
e and on the marquee in the front of our school.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have
 
books in core classes for all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far mor
e meaningful when along with 
the more detailed description of textbooks conta

in our core classes and their dates of publication.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that all 
classrooms, restrooms, and facilities are well
-
maintained and in good 
repair. The principal works directly with the custodial staff to develop regular cleaning schedules to ensure a clean, safe a
nd orderly school. Every morning 
before school begins, the da
y custodian and campus safety assistant inspect facilities for safety hazards or other conditions that need attention prior t
o 
students and staff entering school grounds. One day custodian and one evening custodian
 
 
are assigned to Spanos School. The day c
ustodian is responsible for:
 

 
General maintenance
 

 
Groundskeeping
 

 
Lunch area setup/cleanup
 

 
Restroom cleaning
 

 
Office area cleaning
 
Restrooms are checked throughout the day for cleanliness and subsequently cleaned as needed. The evening custodian is respons
ibl
e for:
 

 
Classroom cleaning
 

 
Common use area cleaning
 

 
Restroom cleaning
 
The principal communicates with custodial staff daily concerning maintenance and school safety issues.
 
 
Stockton Unified takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, we
 
utilize the facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California OPSC. The full report is available upon request.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Monitoring and regulating television viewing
 

 
Volunteering in the classroom

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides th
e following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Our school places a strong emphasis on ensuring t

are in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. Each year a deep cleaning process occurs during a
 
close of school, either dur
ing 
the summer or other extended breaks. In the event of a facility plant emergency, the principal notifies appropriate site and 
district personnel to resolve 
the emergency and safely secure or evacuate the students, based upon the site and district emerge
ncy preparedness plans. A site review with district 
Internal Evaluation Instrument (IEI) occurs annually.
 
 
A comprehensive School Safety Plan, which is reviewed yearly by the staff and the School Site Council, helps to provide a sec
ure, peaceful and clean 

dness Plan identifies 
procedures to follow during emergencies and natural disasters. Emergency drills are conducted on a regular ba
sis.
 
 
Every effort is made to ensure students are monitored while on campus throughout the day. Yard supervisors, teachers, site ad
ministrators and school 
staff provide supervision for students before and during school. The playground is safe for all stude
nts. All visitors must sign in at the office and receive 
proper authorization to be on campus, and must display their passes at all times.
 
 
A copy of our Comprehensive School Safety Plan can be obtained from the office.
