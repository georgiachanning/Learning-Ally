School Description
 
Rancho Santa Fe School District, located in Rancho Santa Fe, CA operates two schools on a single 
site; an elementary school that 
serves students in Kindergarten 
-
 
fifth grade and a middle school 
that serves students in grades 6 
-
 
8.  District enrollment is just under 600 students from the 
communities of Rancho Santa Fe, Elfin Forest, El Cielo, and The Bridges. The Rancho Santa Fe 
co
mmunity is comprised of just over 3,000 people.  We are committed to being the school of choice 
within our community.  RSF students move on to attend the high performing public high schools in 
the San Dieguito School District.
 
 
The school was completely re
novated in 2010 at a cost of $35 million using voter approved bond 
funds. It boasts a beautiful campus with an administration building, five classroom buildings, a 
performing arts center, a gymnasium, three playgrounds, and an athletic field.  Our state of
 
the art 
classrooms are equipped with interactive whiteboards/document cameras, a one
-
to
-
one ratio of 
iPads to students, and flexible seating.  Our science classrooms are true lab/classrooms specifically 
designed for the area of science taught.  The school
 
is adjacent to the Rancho Santa Fe Public Library 
and the Rancho Santa Fe Community Center.  Both partner with the school to provide programs 
and after school care.
 
 
The Rancho Santa Fe School District is one of the oldest districts in San Diego County an
d has a 
longstanding history of academic success.  We are proud of our rigorous curriculum and instruction 
in core subjects, as well as a robust offering of electives in the arts, technology, science, and 
robotics at our middle school.  We are committed to
 
engaging students in their learning, fostering 
their creativity, supporting their efforts, and giving them many opportunities to learn their 
strengths and explore their passions.  Our Robotics Team competes at a local, regional, and national 
level.
 
 
The R
ancho Santa Fe School District also takes great pride in our athletic program.  We offer many 
options for PE, including a general PE class, team sports, and independent study where students 
may pursue their passions, e.g. horseback riding, skating. Team sp
orts are taught by expert coaches 
and elite athletes in soccer, track and field, cross country, wrestling, basketball, volleyball, tennis, 
golf, and football.
 
 
Our character education program teaches students to have exceptional character and to be 
persona
lly responsible, accountable, and aware of their impact on others. We are a caring 
community that promotes mutual respect, interdependence, global awareness, and service to 
others.  To that end, our Student Council organizes school wide philanthropic campa
igns that 
benefit childhood diseases, animal welfare, etc.
 
 
Our parents are very involved in the education of their children.  They support the work of the 
school through volunteering in the classrooms, helping with special events, e.g. Father/Daughter 
Dan
ce, Mother/Son Bowling Outing, and the annual art auction.  We have an Education Foundation 
that raises funds each year to support our programs.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
dist
rict office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Rancho Santa Fe School District held a public hearing on September 13, 2018 and 
determined that each school within the district had sufficient and 
quality textbooks, instructional materials, and science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of
 
California. All students, 
including English learners, are given
 
their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the 
classroom and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the Californi
a Department
 
of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are re
viewed by all teachers and 
a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and admin
istrators. All recommended materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. The table displays information collected in Septem
ber, 2017 about the quality,

Parents and the community are very supportive of the programs at R. Roger Rowe Middle School. Parents volunteer thousands of 
hours each year 
assisting with events an

-
to
-
School Coffee, Assistant Principals' Coffees, Superintendent's Coffees, and Board Members' Coffees are just a few venues wher

Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Many
 
people visit the campus to volunteer in the classroom and participate in school events. Parents and visitors are welcomed, re
quired to check in at

.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan was developed by the district to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The plan 
provides students and 
staff a means of ensuring a safe and an orderly learning environment. Each school includes the following r
equirements of SB 187 within their safe school 
plans: current status of school crime; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies
 
related to suspension and 
expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual harassment po
licy; provision of a school
-

employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and updates it as needed. Safety pr
ocedures, including elements of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan, are 
reviewed with school and district staff in the fall, at the start of each school year.  A copy of the plan is available for p
ublic review at the school office.
 
 

disaster preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire, disaster, and lockdo
wn drills are 
conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year. The school has implemented the Bright Arrow emergency commun
ication system that allows 
the District to place up to 25,000 telephone calls and text messages to emergency contacts within 15 minutes.
