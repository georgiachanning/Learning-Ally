School Description
 
Mission:  Grunsky Elementary School embraces our 

Responsibility toward a Common Goal
--
 

learning for all students.
 
 
Vision:  Grunsky, in partnership with parents and community, will es
tablish foundational skills by providing a 
positive, safe, supportive school and have students strive for academic, social, and emotional excellence.
 
 

maximum
 
academic achievement for every child. Teacher instruction and assessments are based on the 
California Common Core Content Standards. Individual student learning profiles are utilized to identify each 

ropriate program. Teachers use formative Unit of 
Study and MAP assessments to monitor student progress and to adjust their instruction so that all learners 
meet their academic goals. A Program Specialist and Instructional Coach support/coach our staff in t
he 
implementation of school wide researched
-
based strategies and implement small group instruction for at risk 
learners. Students are given an opportunity to attend after school tutoring for additional academic or language 
support. We work collaboratively 
with our families and outside community agencies to increase family 
involvement in our school community. University of Pacific and Stockton Assistance League provides ongoing 
support to our school by offering services. We promote good citizenship through t
he implementation of our 
character education program. Grunsky students are continually demonstrating an increase in academic 
achievement and we will continue to strive to close the achievement gap for all students.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (
School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes fo
r all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California content stan
dards calls for. This information is far more meaningful when along with 

mes of the textbooks used 
in our core classes and their da
tes of publication.

facility during the 2011

2012 school year. Grunsky has 34 classrooms which include 
10 portables. Grunsky has a remodeled multipurpose room, library, 
administration office and modern computer lab.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a timely ma
nner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by Stockton Unified School District to ensure that all classrooms, restrooms,
 
and fac
ilities are well
-
maintained and in good repair. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a c
lean and safe school.
 
 
Stockton Unified takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functi
onal. To assist in this effort, we utilize the facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California OPSC. The full report is available upon request.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
School Safety Plan: Our school places a strong emph

the school facilities are in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. Each year a deep cleaning p
rocess occurs during the summer 
or other extended breaks. The state Williams Team inspects Grunsky annually to verify state health and safety regulations are
 
met.  In the event of a 
facility plant emergency, the principal notifies appropriate site and district personnel to resolve the em
ergency and safely secure or evacuate the 
students, based upon the site and district emergency preparedness plans. A site review with the district Internal Evaluation 
Instrument (IEI) occurs 
annually.
 
 
A comprehensive School Safety Plan, which was most rec
ently reviewed in March 2015 by the School Site Council, helps to provide a secure, peaceful 

ter Preparedness 
Plan identifies proce
dures to follow during emergencies and natural disasters. Emergency drills are conducted on a regular basis. The ParentLink m
essage 
system informs parents in a timely manner of any important safety concerns occurring on campus.
 
 
Every effort is made to ens
ure students are monitored while on campus throughout the school day. Yard supervisors, a full time Campus Safety Assistant, 
teachers, site administrators and school staff provide supervision for students before, during and after school. At 8:05 a.m.
 
all s
chool gates are locked 
and visitors must sign in at the office to receive proper authorization to be on campus. While on campus visitors must displa
y their passes at all times.
