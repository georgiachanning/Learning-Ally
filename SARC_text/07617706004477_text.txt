School Description
 
 
The ongoing mission of Orinda Intermediate School is to promote academic excellence, to 
encourage self
-
reliance, and to foster a sense of belonging to each and every student. Our shared 
vision is one in which every student feels challenged, nu
rtured, motivated, and accepts personal 
responsibility as a member of the school and wider community. Our curriculum is engaging, 
challenging and enriching. We welcome the process of experimentation and view inquiry and 
curiosity as fundamentals for learni
ng. When creativity is encouraged, the learning process is 
enhanced.
 
 
The key components of the Orinda Intermediate School experience are our outstanding academic 
programs, high expectations for students, involved parents, and an educational environment wh
ere 
everyone is valued and respected. Our many character education initiatives continue to enhance 
our overall program by creating a culture of compassion and respect at the school. Excellent 
academic achievement is the cornerstone of the quality of the pr
ograms offered at OIS. To improve 
learning, each department works diligently and collaboratively to implement best practices. The 
departments of core (English language arts and history/social science), mathematics, and science 
administer standards
-
based as
sessments that routinely demonstrate mastery of the content and 

languages, STEM, and visual and performing arts. In addition, students
 
 

d the Educational Foundation of Orinda continue to provide significant 
volunteer and financial contributions to our school. The financial support helps drive our elective 
offerings, which include Spanish, French, woodworking, makerspace, computer programmi
ng, 
broadcasting, web design, computer graphics, choral music, concert band, art, robotics, sculpture, 
debate, strings orchestra, jazz band, leadership, yearbook, video production, public speaking, and 
drama. The fundraising efforts of these groups also pr
ovide support for two full
-
time counselors 
who help with the school climate and the social/emotional well
-
being of all students. Additionally, 
our parent groups support many of our academic initiatives by allowing us to offer professional 
development oppor
tunities for our teachers. The School Site Coordinating Council guides 
improvement efforts in all academic subjects as well as in the areas of communications, technology, 
and character education.
 
 
In order for students to succeed at OIS and beyond, we beli
eve: 1) students must feel safe, both 
physically and emotionally, while an environment of mutual respect, honesty, personal 
responsibility and appreciation of all differences is fostered; 2) learning is collaborative: students, 
parents, and school personne
l form a community of learners; 3) in the value of individual 
differences in learning pace, abilities, and interests; 4) in order to promote a successful community 
at OIS, clear consistent communication should exist; 5) in an educational experience that pr
ovides 

Working together, we are able to create an excellent educational experience.
 
 
Largely due to the commitment of our community of learners and our professional p
artnerships, 
Orinda Intermediate School was named a California Distinguished School in the Spring of 2013 and 
a California Gold Ribbon School in May 2015.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to 
publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to pre
pare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consis
tent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more informatio
n about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school prin
cipal or the 
district office.

Quality, C
urrency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Orinda Union School District (OUSD) convenes textbook committees to help in the selection process. The textbook committees co
nsist of teachers and 
administrators in the Di
strict. State
-
approved books are reviewed, piloted, and a selection is made based upon pre
-
determined criteria. The books go on 
public display for two weeks and are then presented to the Governing Board for adoption. The district has affirmed that class
 
se
ts or electronic versions 
of textbooks are available to all students, including English learners.
 
 
At the middle school level, class sets or electronic versions are also purchased to eliminate the need of students carrying h
eavy books. Books have been 
purc
hased for all core academic areas, as well as visual and performing arts and music, at all grade levels. Textbooks are Califo
rnia Department of 
Education
-
approved and California Standards
-
based.
 
 
A public hearing is held each October and reports are made q
uarterly to the Governing Board to meet all requirements according to the Williams 
Settlement Agreement.

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is the top priority at OIS. Teachers are assigned 
supervision duty before school, at the brunch break, and after school.
 
 
The School Safety Plan is reviewed and updated annually and shared with all staff members. The purpose of the plan is to prep
are students and staff for 
a variety of emergencies that co
uld occur during a school day. On a rotating schedule, the staff and students participate in unannounced fire, earthquake, 
and intruder drills. The School Safety Plan was last reviewed, updated, and discussed with school faculty and staff in the fa
ll of 20
19.
 
 
The fire alarm system is used to signal when an evacuation drill is initiated and indicates the need for all buildings to be 
evacuated. Earthquake drills 
begin with an announcement over the intercom system that we are simulating an earthquake. This re
quires students and staff to duck, cover, and hold 
until the shaking has stopped. Under the direction of the teacher, the students are then told when it is safe to evacuate the
 
buildings and line up outside 
by class at their assigned location. Individual s
taff members then go into action on emergency response teams. Responsibilities include command central, 
structural evaluation, search and rescue, first aid, student accountability, campus security, communications, and student pic

up. Emergency response 
te

 
to keep emergency 
supplies up to date.  The food and water supplies were updated and replenished in August 2014. Classroom emergen
cy supply bags were replaced and 
replenished in the fall of 2019. Finally, intruder lockdown drills involve the entire school sheltering in place by entering 
the nearest room, securing all 
doors and windows, closing all window coverings, and maintaining a 
quiet environment with all individuals obscured from view of anyone outside the 
building.  Everyone remains silent in this position until given the "All Clear" message.
 
 
The maintenance and operations department of the District works closely with the site 
administration to ensure a safe campus. Five security cameras 
have been installed at OIS as of September 2015.
