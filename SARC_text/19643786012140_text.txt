Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parent 
participation and involvement is an integral part of student success at Willow Elementary School. A highly active 
Parent Teacher Association (PTA) coordinates many activities, programs, and events that directly support the school's 
instructional program. P
TA members provide a true sense of community purpose and direction centered toward the 
education of students at Willow Elementary School. Fundraisers support field trips, assemblies, and student incentives.
 
 
Parents also have the opportunity to serve on th
e Willow School Site Council that meets monthly to review the School Site 
Plan, instructional goals, upcoming activities and school focus. Families of students who are English language learners 
meet monthly at an English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) 
where school information and student achievement are 
discussed.
 
 
Classroom instruction is augmented by a large group of parent volunteers. Parents who wish to participate in Willow 
Elementary School's PTA, School Site Council (SSC), English Language Adviso
ry Committee (ELAC), and other school 
committees or become a volunteer may contact Karen Goss, Principal at (626) 914

The school principal conducts earthquake, fire, lock downs, and other emergency drills on a regular monthly basis in 
a
ccordance with the site disaster plan. An Emergency bin contains emergency supplies, first aid kits, food, water, and 
rescue equipment in a central location on the school campus. The School Site Safety Plan is designed to assist in preparing 
for emergencie
s, managing emergency response efforts, and maintaining a safe school environment.
 
 
The Emergency Preparedness Plan requires identification of security needs, development of prevention and intervention 
techniques, evaluation of physical facilities, and com
munication with staff and students. Components of the School Site 
Safety Plan include strategies and programs that will provide and maintain a high level of school safety, an assessment of 
current school safety on campus and at school functions, and proced
ures related to the compliance of existing laws as 
they affect school safety. Safety procedures and elements of the School Site Safety Plans are reviewed with staff annually 
at the start of every school year.
