School Description
 
A Message from the Principal:  Monarch, "a small school with a big heart", is an alternative school 
of choice. We provide a developmental approach, where each child is seen as an 
individual with 
various strengths and needs. Our curriculum uses science and social studies themes from the 
Common Core Standards to teach both basic skills and critical thinking to our students in mixed
-
age groups. At Monarch students learn to use their h
earts and minds well.
 
 
The foundation of our program is a robust social
-
emotional curriculum, based on the Positive 
Discipline philosophy. Our goal is to create a healthy environment of mutual respect and dignity for 
both children and adults, as well as 
to foster good communication and problem
-
solving skills. This 
foundation gives the academic curriculum a place to root and grow.
 
 
Monarch is located on the Branciforte Small Schools Campus (BSSC) and has four multiage 
classrooms. Children are grouped accor
ding to their academic and social needs, not according to 
their age alone. The school benefits from the support of the nonprofit Monarch Community Board, 
a group of parents that supports parent participation, parent education, and fund
-
raising within 
our s
chool community. Parent participation is critical to the running of the school and the spirit of 
the community.
 
 
Major Achievements
 

Schools, Alternative Family
 
Education (AFE) Home school, Georgiana Bruce Kirby Preparatory 
School and Pacific Collegiate Charter School.
 
 
For the thirteenth year, graduating students demonstrated their mastery of our exit criteria to a 
panel of adults and peer students. Graduating s
tudents present evidence showing their academic 
growth in all subject areas including Math and English Language Arts, as well as leadership 
development, while at Monarch School. In 2010 the Monarch staff presented their work on the exit 
criteria program at
 
the Fall Forum, the national conference for the Coalition of Essential Schools.
 
 
Monarch will continue the Exit Criteria project, where graduating students must demonstrate that 
they are ready to move on to middle school by presenting work from their port
folios to a panel of 
teachers, parents, visiting educators and administrators, and student peers.
 
 
Inspired Purpose
 
A community of creative problem solvers learning to use their hearts and minds together.

Monarch students are expressive communicators and creative problem solvers who are willing to take risks. They take on leader
ship roles 
and have a voice in the school. They are competent
 
and confident learners, both individually and in groups. Monarch students use their 
minds well: they find evidence, see from multiple viewpoints, discover connections, make suppositions, and determine relevanc
e (Habits 
of Mind). They display personal best
 
effort and are kind and helpful. They demonstrate listening skills and the ability to follow directions. 
Students develop a strong social consciousness that manifests in real social action. Monarch parents are involved in shared g
overnance 
through active 
membership in Site Council and the Monarch Community School Parent Board. They are fundraisers. They are actively 
involved in school wide jobs. They are committed to clear communication with each other, the staff, and the students. Monarch
 
parents 
are part
ners in supporting the educational mission of the school.
 
 
Mission
 
Students learn a foundation of skills and knowledge that will serve them well in life and in their academic careers. The Mona
rch "Bill of 
Rights" is the guide post for eliciting safe, pro
-
s
ocial behavior. All students are known well by many adults, including parents who volunteer 
in the classroom. The small size of the school, as well as parental and campus
-
wide involvement, help to create good spirit and a sense of 
community. Students are u
sually grouped according to their learning needs, not their grade level or age. Students take responsibility for 
their learning and the learning of their fellow students by creating and evaluating learning goals, developing excellent Habi
ts of Mind, 
creati
ng culminating projects, exercising choices at multiple points in the curriculum, and initiating real
-
world actions, including 
community service. Curriculum and instructional strategies are planned collaboratively and adapted to the learning styles and
 
dev
elopmental stages of the students.

About the SARC
 
By Feb
ruary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SAR
C). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Fun
ding Formula (LCFF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state
 
and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

For additional information about 
the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or the district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical

with a focus on implementation of neurosequential model tenets into lessons, 1:1 meetings, and school structure. We will also
 
begin to explore
 
restorative justice practices around community buidling. We will undertake a number of actions to meet this goal. We will con
tinue to hold positive 
discipline support group classes, explicitly teach and practice self
-
regulation techniques, provide trainin
g for implementation of restorative justice 
practices, and focus on the neurosequential model in lesson design in various professional development sessions.
 
 
The second goal in our 2018
-
19 plan is to develop a comprehensive plan to deal with issues of home
lessness impacting our school site. We will undertake 
a number of actions to meet this goal. We will create a morning safety checklist and a protocol for dealing with homeless iss
ues that arise when school 
is not in session. We will also monitor time spent
 
dealing with issues of homelessness during the 2018
-
19 school year to serve as a baseline. Finally we 
will work with the Santa Cruz Homeless Services Center and the School Resource Officer to review our safety checklist and pro
posed response to issues 
of 
homelessness.
