By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Perdew Elementary 
provides a safe and clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance and campus 
supervision. Original school buildings were constructed in 2007. Ongoing maintenance ensures school facilities are kept 
safe, in good working condition, and
 
continue to provide adequate space for students and staff.

Perdew Elementary is proud of its high standards regarding campus maintenance and general housekeeping practices. 
Staff and students enjoy the benefits of having a well
-
maintained and beautiful 
campus.
 
 
School staff and the maintenance department work together to ensure playgrounds, classrooms, and campus grounds are 
well
-
maintained. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) oversees a work order process enabling school staff to 
communicate unscheduled ma
intenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Teachers, support staff, and the 
principal collaborate efforts to prepare and submit work orders to M&O for resolution. Emergency situations are given 
high priority and resolved immediately by site or d
istrict custodial staff. The principal, school secretary, and day custodian 
communicate each morning on an informal basis to discuss schedules, campus maintenance, and safety concerns. The 
director of maintenance and operations (M&O) meets with the princip
al once a month to discuss maintenance
-
related 
issues associated with campus upkeep, safety, classroom space, equipment, upcoming events, work orders (submitted 
and outstanding), and special requests. The director of M&O then meets with the custodian to co
nduct a comprehensive 
inspection of the school site, and a summary of the inspection findings is forwarded to the principal.
 
 
Schools are required by state law to conduct a formal inspection annually of designated areas and systems and then 
prepare a repor
t of the current condition of facilities. The School Site Inspection table illustrated in this report identifies 
the state
-
required inspection areas and discloses the operational status in each of those areas.
 
 

fied and equipped to handle routine cleaning needs, general maintenance, 
and minor repairs. M&O provides formal training twice a year on the proper use of equipment, cleaning procedures, and 
chemical usage. One full
-
time day custodian is responsible for ke
eping the campus clean and fully operational. The 

meals are served. Every morning before school begins, the day custodian inspects sc
hool facilities for safety hazards and 
maintenance issues that require attention before staff and students arrive on campus. Restrooms are checked throughout 
the day as a proactive measure in keeping facilities stocked, sanitary, and safe. Any graffiti or 
signs of vandalism are 
removed immediately.
 
 
A professional janitorial service is responsible for thoroughly cleaning classrooms and restrooms during the evenings. The 
district office dispatches a team of groundskeepers each week to maintain Perdew Element

systems.
 
 
Etiwanda School District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program which provides dollar
-
for
-
dollar 
matching funds to assist school districts with major repairs or replacement of existing schoo
l building components. These 
repairs typically include roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior/exterior painting, and 
floor systems.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achi
evement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entranc
e to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
