School Description
 
The teachers and staff at La Presa Elementary School strive to foster a positive, collaborative, 
learning community where students, parents, families, teachers, and staff work together for the 
success of all students. We are committed to providing students
 
with a challenging and enriching 
education that helps them learn to read well, think clearly, communicate effectively, compute 
accurately, value and appreciate diversity, and work to find creative solutions to complex problems. 
The instructional program, 
developed through a collaborative effort of grade
-
level professional 
learning communities along with support staff, is designed to ensure students are equipped with 
the knowledge and skills required for proficiency in District Performance and California Co
ntent 
Standards. Data results of both teacher created formative and summative assessments as well as 
district benchmark assessments are used to guide classroom instruction, adjust pacing, and 
differentiate the educational program to meet the needs of all s
tudents. La Presa Elementary 
provides a comprehensive standards
-
based instructional program designed to support each child 
in reaching his/her academic potential. Professional learning communities within and across grade 
levels work collaboratively to ensu
re individual student needs are met, students are supported in 
the learning process, and students experience success at school. Student support at La Presa 
includes differentiated instruction for all students as needed and targeted remediation for those 
st
udents not performing at grade level. Our interventions include Lexia Core 5, Imagine Learning, 
Flex, Read Well, IXL Math, and Moby Max. We integrate social studies, science, the arts, and 
physical education into daily learning experiences. The entire staf
f encourages a positive learning 
environment in which students are happy and excited about becoming lifelong learners.
 
 
LPE Mission Statement: Our mission is to equip and empower all students to achieve academic 
success and become global citizens.

About the SARC
 
By Febru
ary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fundi
ng Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state a
nd local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the sch
ool, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical

Professional learning in La Mesa
-
Spring Valley continues evolving to cultivate capacity and efficacy of teachers so that they can ensure high levels of 
learning for each and every student. In recent years professional learning has emphasized developing a c
ommon language around high quality teaching 
and learning and building collaborative cultures that promote high levels of learning for all students through professional l
earning communities. This 
work has included a deeper dive into content standards throug
h the selection of essential standards and discussions around mastery and effective 
assessment. In response to student performance data and classroom observation, current professional learning focuses on align
ing instruction to 
standards and student experi
ence, with extra time and resources dedicated to mathematics and English learners.
 
 
New for the 2019
-
20 school year is our Blended Professional Development program which will offer online professional development options while
 
still 
offering face
-
to
-
face professional development. Some of the professional learning that we will offer includ
es: Igniting ELD multi
-
year seminars where 
teachers learn and implement strategies for designated and integrated ELD and using formative assessment to guide standards
-
based instruction, Mindful 
Math where participants will develop deeper understandings of 
math teaching and how to enrich it while making the District math curriculum more 
accessible to their students, and ProAct, which teaches participants techniques they can use to deescalate a child's behavior
.  Additional professional 
development continues 
to address professional learning communities, curriculum adoptions, differentiation, special education, NGSS and effective 
integration of technology into instruction.
 
 
With professional learning communities as a foundation, professional development is appr
oached from multiple angles to ensure that it is relevant, 
timely, and targeted to both student and teacher needs. Teachers meet weekly, as a grade level or discipline, to analyze stud
ent data and discuss best 
practices to address the needs of each and eve
ry student.
