School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or
 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
pr
incipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Nestled on the western shore of Humboldt County, amid the towering redwood trees of northern California is 
South Bay 
School with a population of 190 students in grades 4

strong spirit and hard  work ethic. The staff strives to be exemplary role models of 
nurturing, caring individuals.
 
 
We offer extended educational opportunities until 6:00 p.m. each day through our EXPLORE after school program. This 
allows about 50% of ou
r students to receive help with their homework, recreational and educational activities that better 
prepare them to meet the demands of the State Academic Content Standards.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Teachers and administrators from both school sites have participated in School Safety Plan Training at Humboldt County 
Office of Education and are actively updating and revising the 
present Safety Plan to reflect necessary changes. Our 
Comprehensive School District Safety Plan is continuously undergoing a comprehensive review with new goals and related 
action plans to be determined.  The superintendent assumes incident command should 
an emergency occur. Emergency 
plans are in place, and have been rehearsed. For example, we participated in the Great California Shake
-
out on October 
of 2018 to practice our Earthquake procedure.

South Bay Elementary provides identified students with reading and math intervention services. Trimester/annual 
assessments identify students in 
need of additional instruction. The Intervention Study Team meets weekly to support 
students, families,and teachers who are experiencing academic or behavioral challenges. Root causes to barriers effecting 
educational access are identified and a plan with 
a measurable goal is made to meet the students needs. Additional 
support is provided in our after school program with homework help, enrichment, social skills and recreational activities.

Staff development is held during 3 pre

service days at the start of the school year. The district also has minimum days 
each Wednesday afternoon where teachers collaborate and focus on professional 
development. The district determines 
a professional development emphasis through a combination of reviewing student achievement data, input gathered on 
the LCAP Stakeholder Input surveys, . researching evidence proven solutions to root causes that inhibit 
student 
achievement.  This year was focused on reading instruction (Success for All) and technology (Google Classroom).
