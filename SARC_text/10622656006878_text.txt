About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For addition
al information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Pla
nned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Public
 
School Construction. The results of this survey are available at the KCUSD Business Office.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are provided w
ith a clean, safe, and 
functional lea
rning environment. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by speaking with the
 
school 
principal.
 
 
Washington Elementary School has 19 classrooms, a multipurpose room, and an administration building. The main c
ampus was built in 1949. Additional 
classrooms were constructed in 1954. Additional relocatable classrooms were constructed in 1987 and 1990.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order
 
are completed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
The Director of Maintenance, Custodial Supervisor, and the site principals work cooperatively with the c
ustodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar f
or dollar basis to assist 
school districts with ex
penditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing
, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessme
nts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards,
 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter

ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for 
Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parent involvement and communication are essential to our school success. Washington Elementary School continually strives to
 
involve parents by 
exchanging information that helps parents understand and support sch
ool programs and by providing opportunities for parent participation in school 
activities.
 
 
There are numerous and varied opportunities for parent involvement. Parents attend school functions, participate in parent
-
teacher conferences, 
volunteer in classro
oms, chaperone field trips, various workshops and assist with other school activities. Parents may also serve on advisory com
mittees 
and leadership teams, including Parent Teacher Club (PTC) and School Site Council (SSC)  and English Learner Advisory Commi
ttee (ELAC) and Parent 
Advisory Committee (Pre
-
school Parents 
-
 
PAC). The PTC at Washington is very active, organizing numerous extracurricular functions and conducting 
fundraising for field trips. Washington received a grant in 2016
-
2017 from Birth
-
3 year
s old from Save the Children that has a coordinator that visits 
homes of 20 families that have babies as well as Community for children 3
-
5 who are not in preschool.   We have Parent Academy which parents can 
participate to help their child succeed in scho
ol as well as Gymboree for child and parent play.
 
Parents of English Learners are able to participate in Puente a Tecnologia, which is a chromebook check out for the home with
 
internet access.  This 
program will help parents and students acquire English.
 
 
Home and school communication is enhanced through weekly notices, monthly newsletters, parent/teacher conferences, the studen
t/parent handbook, 
the school website, student report cards, direct phone calling system and other regular communication activities
. Translation is regularly provided. In 
addition, parent education classes and workshops are offered regularly.  We also use an app called "Peach Jar" which sends no
tices immediately to 
parents phones.
 
 
Parents who would like more information on how to bec
ome involved may contact Principal Greg Visser at (559) 305

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Oth
er local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Washington Elementary School. Before, during, and after school, the camp
us is monitored by assigned 
staff. All visitors must sign in at the office and wear appropriate identification while on campus. The
 
comprehensive school safety plan is designed to 
assist in preparing for emergencies, managing emergency response efforts, and maintaining a safe school environment. The plan
 
requires identification 
of security needs, development of prevention and interven
tion techniques, evaluation of physical facilities, and communication with staff and students. 
Components of the plan include: child abuse reporting procedures, procedures for teacher notification of dangerous pupils, di
saster response procedures, 
procedur
es for safe ingress and egress from school, sexual harassment policies, and suspension and expulsion policies. The safety pla
n is reviewed 
annually, updated as needed, and fully compliant with federal and state regulations. The plan was last reviewed/updat
ed on November 13, 2019 and 

aster preparedness plan 
includes steps for ensuring the safety of students and staff during a disaster.
 
Emergency preparedness drills are conducted regularly and the school staff 
is appropriately trained.
