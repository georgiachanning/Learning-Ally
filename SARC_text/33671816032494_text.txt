Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements
 
(Most Recent Year)
 
 
Ruth Brown Elementary provides a safe, clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance and campus 
supervision. School facilities are all up
-
todate and provide adequate space for students and staff. Ruth Brown 
Elementary 
School was built in 1956. Since that time, new buildings have been constructed, portables have been added to 
accommodate enrollment growth, and existing buildings have been updated. Several years ago, the campus was 
completely renovated and mode
rnized to accommodate existing and future needs. During the 2005
-
06 school year, Ruth 

current Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requireme
nts and the installation of a shade structure on the north side of 
campus in the dismissal area. The campus is cleaned by a daytime and an evening janitorial staff.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents and 
community members are caring and committed individuals who support the education program at Ruth 
Brown Elementary School. Along with the School Site Council (SSC) and English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), board 
members, community service organizations
, and parent volunteers dedicate time to volunteer in the classrooms. 
Community organizations and area businesses contribute incentive rewards for academic excellence and good citizenship. 
Monthly assemblies and school activities are also offered on campus
 
to help guide parents in their effort to improve their 

fund raises to provide extra items for the school. They also work to provide a
ctivities for student involvement, such as 
dances, fall festivals, multicultural events, and movie nights. The partnerships developed between the school and 
community volunteers and organizations enhance the experience of all the students at Ruth Brown Ele
mentary.
 
 
Parents and students are able to keep updated and informed by viewing our school website at www.pvusd.us/rbes. On 
the site, one may access school information such as our parent handbook. Ruth Brown also uses Aeries Parent Connection, 
which allows
 
parents to view grades and attendance online. Ruth Brown Elementary also has a Facebook page called Ruth 
Brown Bears. Parents are encouraged to join this closed group. We also use a school wide recorded telephone message 
system to inform parents of emerge
ncy situations and general school information.

response procedures, procedures for safe arrival and departure from school, sexual harassment policy, and dress code
