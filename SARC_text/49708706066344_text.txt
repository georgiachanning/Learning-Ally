By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Olivet Elementary School is nestled on the edge of Laguna de Santa Rosa on the western
 
boundary of the City of Santa 
Rosa. It is known for it's quality education offered by experienced teachers and support staff. Olivet is a TK
-
6 school with 
approximately 320 students and 13 teachers. Olivet has a highly qualified, professional staff, skill
ed at working with all 
students in a caring manner. The school has a family feeling and thrives on being a "Small School with a Big Heart". Olivet 
is fortunate to have a very active parent group called "Olivet Families" which sponsors over 15 fun school ev
ents 
throughout the school year.
 
 
We also have Program Assistants (PAs) who are used in all classes on a daily basis. These dedicated individuals provide 
small group and individual instruction to students who may need additional help in math or language ar
ts; they also serve 
to relieve the teacher by monitoring students doing independent work, so that the teacher may provide intensive 
instruction as needed. PAs also administer the progress monitoring assessments that provide valuable academic data to 
the te
achers. What is special about these adults, is that they are also supervisors during recess. They get a chance to know 
the students in and out of the classroom setting allowing trusting relationships to develop.
 
 
Technology is prevalent in all classrooms: 
students in grades 1
-
3 have iPad mini labs in their classrooms, and grades 4
-
6 
each classroom have 1:1 Chromebooks to use while collaborating, researching, writing, typing programs, as well as ELA & 
Math tutorials, and for completion of on
-
line assessments
.
 
 
Olivet School is a well
-
balanced, elementary school where students enjoy multiple forms of learning activities and engage 
in 21st Century Learning experiences:
 
 

 
Weekly assemblies begin each week with the school pledge, the Pledge of Allegiance, and a ne
w  "Tool of the 
Week" from the ToolBox Project. This effort fosters a keen focus and sense of school community for students, 
staff, and families that stay to listen to the assembly.
 

 
Field trips to museums, the Luther Burbank
 
Center of the Arts, California Missions, Angel Island, the Exploratorium, 
Marin Headlands, local farms, pumpkin patches, fire stations, and more.
 

 
Activities that include parades, Stone Age Days, photography, campus beautification days, carnivals, Hawaiian
 
luaus, talent shows, skate nights, star
-
gazing, BBQ's, harvest and book fairs, and more;
 

 
Museum related exhibits and activities are held on campus from the Charles Schulz Museum, the Lawrence Hall 
of Science and special guest musical performers engage stu
dents in sing
-
a
-
long concerts. All ignite students' 
enthusiasm for school;
 

 
Art projects that include Asian calligraphy and painting, hand
-
painted crafts, window paintings, mosaics, masks, 
and more;
 

 
After school tutorial, art, music, running, and gardening 
programs are offered on campus;
 

 
Students provide service activities such as reading to special need preschoolers who meet on our campus and 
helping in our local community such as with the recycling program that helps fund our sixth grade science camp.
 
 
The
 
district and school mission statement is clearly reflected at Olivet: As a community, we engage in authentic, dynamic, 
and relevant learning that develops each student's academic, emotional, and social growth.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Safety, cleanliness and maintenance of facilities are a high priority at our school. Classrooms are cleaned every other day. 
They are vacuumed and mopped several
 
times weekly. The multi
-
purpose room is cleaned every week. Picnic tables where 
students eat snack and lunch are cleaned at least 3 times per week. Heavy traffic areas and classrooms are cleaned as 
needed during school breaks. The site is maintained by 1.
87 FTE custodians. One custodian is available throughout the 
school day to attend to emergency cleaning or repair issues. The night time custodian also cleans rooms and assists with 
night security. Student restrooms are cleaned daily and monitored frequent
ly to ensure they are well stocked and clean 
during the day. Common areas, such as the sidewalks are maintained regularly and the kindergarten play yard has bark 
swept and raked weekly. Any actions taken by an outside company comply with all school safety 
requirements.
 
 
The maintenance of the school facility is under the jurisdiction of a business manager and site administrator. There are no 
gas leaks, all heating and air conditioning systems are functioning at present as well as fire sprinklers. Ventilatio
n is 
available in classrooms by opening windows or using the heating/air conditioning system and fan. In the event of a power 
failure, the custodian and principal are trained on starting generators on the well to ensure the water supply is maintained

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., 
California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/
literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California St
ate University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Olivet Elementary Charter
 
School is fortunate to have a large group of caring parents who are actively involved. "Olivet 
Families Organization" is our local parent group that generates thousands of dollars each year through fundraising events 
(Harvest Fair, Bingo Night), Box Tops 
for education, and SCRIP monies. The funds that are generated may be used for field 
trips, purchase of improved sound systems used in the classrooms, to improve our big yard play equipment, and 
improvements to enhance the educational opportunities for our 
students.The biggest contributions come not from the 
funds, but by through parent participation. Olivet parent volunteers are encouraged to assist in the classrooms and around 
the school with many activities. Olivet Families can be contacted via olivetfami
lies@gmail.com. The meetings are held the 
second Monday of each month, 6:30 pm, in the staff room.
 
 
Each year the site and district parent organizations put on celebrations such as a gala and/or luau. Attendees have the 
opportunity to participate in silent
 
and live auctions while they get to mingle with the other families, friends, and staff 
members from the schools. There is a strong sense of camaraderie and community developed through such events.
 
 
Parents assist in the classrooms by helping with a small 
group of students or when they volunteer to plan events for that 
particular class. Come and join us during our Bingo or our Movie Night! Spend some time with us at  at our Harvest Fair or 
at our Spring Carnival. If you have questions about parent participa
tion, feel free to contact your child's teacher, or Mrs. 
Leon, our Office Manager, at (707) 522

School Safety Plan (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school safety plan is designed to assure student safety throughout the school day, and/or during man made and 
natural emergencies. Frequent drills (emergency phone tree, fire and earthquake drills) keep students and staff updated 
on cur
rent safety skills. These skills include the ability to communicate with district office and outside agencies for ongoing 
support services through strong network of city, county, state and federal communication services. We have an emergency 
phone tree to 
contact all staff members with vital information when the need arises. We have a PA system to call for 
assistance to the office in time of medical needs so that we can service individuals. The Safety Plan is updated yearly, and 
the staff, parents and Schoo
l Site Council review the procedures in the Safety Plan. Through School Site Council, families 
are invited to provide input in polishing the plan. Improvements are evident: new radios for office staff, principal, yard 
duty staff, and office manager are in 
use to expedite reaction time to needs on campus. The parents group has provided 
water and granola bars to have on hand in the case of an emergency as well. Parent communication has been improved 
with the use of the automatic dialing system where all paren
ts can be telephoned with a message in less than 20 minutes. 
Staff receives regular training as needed after drills are assessed.
 
 
During the school day. students and staff use The Toolbox Project, Restorative Justice Practices, and Positive Behavior 
Inter
vention Systems of Support to develop a climate that encourages children to do the right things and feel safe with 
the peers and adults on campus. We also integrate the theme of Kindness throughout our daily practices.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018

The District provides programs and supplemental services that support and assist students including Title I, Title II, Title 
III, Title IV, Class
 
Size Reduction, and Program Assistants for each teacher. The district provides training for teacher and 
administrators on the new math program and Writer's Workshop. Aides are provided with training on reading instructional 
support to better enable them t
o provide support for the teachers and students. Additional programs include PE, Art, 
Music, Library, Running Club, Gardening Club, and after school tutoring.
 
 
Olivet also has an intervention program across grade levels. It begins in Kindergarten. At the c
onclusion of each school 
day, kinder students are put into "focus groups" based on their needs. These groups learn about letter and number sense 
to set them up for reading and utilizing their math skills. All students are assessed using Fountas & Pinnell G
uided Rading 
system. Students are then taught to read in small groups, based on the results of the guided reading assessment. After 
school tutoring is offered to students who need an extra boost to achieve grade level proficiency.
 
 
Social Emotional needs a
nd programs include a Multi
-
tiered System of Support. The system begins with the Toolbox 
Programs that consists of 12 tools that students learn about and can used when managing their behavior at school. The 
students learn how to use their tools through les
sons in the classroom, creating student led videos, and at weekly whole
-
school assemblies. We also use Restorative Justice questioning strategies to create a safe learning environment. Most 
recently, we are learning how to implement Positive Behavior Inter
vention Systems of Support 
-
 
a "catch them doing 
something good" strategy.

When a child is egregious in their behavior their parent is called and/or a Behavior Intervention for is sent home. This 
action is to ensure the parents are informed and allows a t
eam 
-
 
home/school approach, to student management. 
Frequently, students spend time with the principal (or Office Manager) to discuss how to use the tools. Short
-
term 
counseling is also offered when a student is identified as needing it (usually, through te
acher or principal referral).

Currently, the primary focus for professional development 
at Olivet Elementary Charter School centers around Common 
Core English Language Arts and Math standards, NGSS, and 21st century teaching, learning and assessment. The other 
area of school
-
wide focus has to do with developing a safe and positive school clim
ate. All teachers and classified 
personnel have participated in Toolbox professional development and we are beginning a focus on Restorative Justice 
Practices. Teachers and students have created videos to use for teaching the tools. Additionally, teachers 
utilize Tool Box 
videos, and each tool is addressed on a rotating basis at the weekly whole
-
school assemblies. Positive Behavior 
Intervention and Systems of Support (PBIS), are also a part of the Multi
-
tiered Systems of Support (MTSS). 
 
 
Professional devel
opment is delivered after school on early release days, during non
-
student workdays, during dedicated 
days during summer, and by full and half day release days. Much professional development takes place in grade level team 
meetings. Teachers are supported 
by site and district administrators, district coaches, consultants, and the district Director 
of Innovative Learning. Teachers have professional development opportunities while attending STEAM Labs (NGSS) with 
their students and participating in poetry wor
kshops delivered by California Poets in the Schools (CCSS ELA). This year, 
several teachers will also participate in School Garden Project program. Olivet teachers attend grade span and/or grade 
level meetings to assess and analyze student data and collabo
rate to plan instruction and intervention as well as determine 
needs for staff development. 
 
 
The district provides training based on identified goals for district staff which include:
 

 
Training to support adopted instructional materials (currently Bridges 
Math K
-
5 and Carnegie Math grade 6, 
Lucy Calkins Units of Study Writing grades K
-
6, Fountas and Pinnell Guided Reading)
 

 
Training to provide teachers with certification and skills necessary to work with English Language Learners

Core State Standards. Teacher participants are selected to attend county
-
level trainings related to the implementation of 
the Common Core State Standards and technology in orde
r to be part of the teacher training teams when they return to 
the site and district
-
level meetings.
 
 
Teachers regularly meet together during the school hours at the site level to develop SMART goals and review data 
collected using DIBELS, LEXIA, STAR Ente
rprise Math and Reading Assessments, CAASPP Interim Assessments, and Bridges 
assessments. During this time, teachers collaborate as grade level teams, and in groupings to ensure horizontal and vertical 
alignment of the curriculum and to exchange student in
formation.
 
 
Teachers focus on the four crucial questions:
 
 
1.
 
What is it we expect our students to learn? 
 
2.
 
How will we know when they have learned it?
 
3.
 
How will we respond when they do not learn it? 
 
4.
 
How will we respond when they already know it?
 
 
The district
