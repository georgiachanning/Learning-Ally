School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-

As a National Blue Ribbon and California Distinguished Fundamental and GATE Magnet School, Tustin Memorial Academy 
passionately believes that by focusing on the foundati
ons of literacy through readers and writers workshop and 
mathematics through CGI (Cognitively Guided Instruction) in a character
-
building environment, we will produce strong 
readers, writers, problem solvers, thinkers, innovators, and responsible citizens.
 
All students are provided with STEAM 
opportunities and experiences that promote critical thinking, collaboration, creativity, and communication as 21st
-
century 
learners. All students engage in learning in the iTeam Headquarters Innovation Lab throughout t
he year and actively 
participate in school
-
wide events such as STEAM challenges to support their creativity and learning.  GATE strategies 
deepen critical thinking by focusing on depth and complexity of the grade
-
level standards. The fundamental aspect of 
the 
school also holds high expectations for student achievement, critical thinking, development, and growth. Local and state 
progress indicators and the CA Dashboard results provide ongoing data that drives instruction at all grade levels 
throughout the ye
ar. The school
-

between what students learn and how they can impact others and the world around them. There is a strong focus on the 
social
-
emotional needs of its students through
 
mindfulness, social thinking practices, and the implementation of a social
-
emotional curriculum and its connection to academic achievement. Growth and innovative mindsets continue to be 
school
-
wide themes, and students are taught responsible and respectfu
l behavior as outlined in the TMA Commitment 
Agreement. Our established garden, service
-
learning, and student
-
led activities are integral aspects of the school and 
school community. Our unwavering commitment and devotion to our students as leaders of tomor
row is represented by

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Tustin Unified School District takes great efforts to
 
ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in 
this effort, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School 
Construction (OPSC). The results of this survey are available at
 
the school office, the District office, or on the Internet at 
https://tinyurl.com/TUSD

Tool. The District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to 
keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timel
y manner. A work order process is used to 
ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.

wide beautification efforts by the school community and the district include extensive

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There are many opportunities in the district for parental involvement through participation in parent surveys, support 
organizations, booster clubs, school site councils, GATE, DELAC and district
-
level advisory committees with the 
superintendent. Parents a
t Tustin Memorial Academy participate in activities such as Parent/Teacher conferences and 
School Site Council Meetings.
 
 
Parents and families are involved throughout the campus on a daily basis at Tustin Memorial Academy.  Parents participate 
in our Paren
t Teacher Organization (PTO), School Site Council, Gifted and Talented Community Advisory Committee, and 
Superintendent's Advisory Committee. Our school has built a unique culture that includes strong parent partnerships. 
Every family signs a Commitment Ag
reement each year which encourages at least 10 hours of volunteer work. We utilize 
our volunteers in various capacities including in classrooms, in the garden, during PE, in our iTeam innovation lab, the 
library, the office, at school events, or on the pla
yground. Parents are actively involved in school activities such as Mother 
Daughter Tea, Guys Night, Family Reading and Movie Nights, Son Appreciation Night, Family Art Night, Family Lunches, 
and other evening community events. Our school
-
wide communicatio
n to parents provides a multitude of ways for every 
family to be involved in some way. Our unique dad's group HEROES (Helping Enrich Resources of Every Student) 
emphasizes getting fathers, uncles, and grandparents involved in school activities. The HEROES 
have been recognized by 
the Orange County Department of Education for their unique program and received a Golden Bell Award from the 
California School Boards Association for their innovative techniques of getting fathers, uncles, grandparents, and other 
ma
le relatives involved in school and providing additional resources for students. Communication among parents, 
students, and teachers is a high
-
priority at TMA and we strive to build a strong support system in order to help our students 
to be successful.  A
 
weekly e
-
blast, the All
-
Star News, goes out to families each week with updates, an upcoming calendar 
of events, and parent strategies.  Parents receive specialized parent education training throughout the year at the school, 
as well as through the distric
t and county levels. TMA prides itself on its strong collaboration with parents to provide a 
unique and supportive culture and environment for all students.
