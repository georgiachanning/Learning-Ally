DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://
dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains 
additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQues
t 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment,
 
high school graduates, dropouts, 
course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). 
Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other 
use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending on 
availability), th
e types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Our school places a strong emphasis on ensuring the safety of all students and staff members. Every effort is made to ensure 
students are monitored while on cam
pus throughout the school day. Two Campus Safety Assistants (CSA), noon duty 
supervisors, teachers, site administrators, and school staff provide supervision for students before, during, and after schoo
l. 
The playgrounds are safe for all students. All visi
tors must sign in at the office and receive proper authorization to be on 
campus, and must display their passes at all times. The county Sheriff, SUSD police, fire department, and ambulance service 
are all support entities which serve and teach, further en
suring student, staff, and community safety.
 
 

health and safety regulations. Each year a deep cleaning process occurs during a close o
f school, either during the summer 
or other extended breaks. In the event of a facility plant emergency, the principal notifies appropriate site and district 
personnel to resolve the emergency and safely secure or evacuate the students, based upon the site
 
and district emergency 
preparedness plans. A site review with the district Internal Evaluation Instrument (IEI) occurs annually.
 
 
A comprehensive School Safety Plan was submitted in August 2016.  It is reviewed twice yearly by the certificated staff at a 

Preparedness Plan identifies procedures to follow during emergencies and natural disasters and which staff member is 
responsible for which
 
duty. Emergency drills are conducted on a regular basis.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes fo
r all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether thos
e books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far more meaningful when along with 

mes of the tex
tbooks used 
in our core classes and their dates of publication.

School Fac
ility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Henry Elementary School opened in August of 2006. Our site has classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library and an administrati
on building. We have 35 
classrooms serving over 1,000 students. Includ
ed are spaces for two computer labs and a library. In addition, we have a Parent Resource Center and 
several smaller rooms used to work with students in smaller groupings. Our outdoor facility is excellent for school activitie
s and is used as well by 
commu
nity groups and the STEP
-
Up After School Program.  Use of Facilities forms allows for other agencies to provide services on site after school hours.
 
 
Past construction projects were completed to increase the level of security and safety for the campus. Fro
nt gates have been renovated to allow 
accessibility of the school through one main entrance at the front office. An electronic gate will provide additional securit
y to ensure only authorized 
visitors may enter campus. Two emergency access gates have been i
nstalled off of the main athletic field, to allow easier accessibility in the event of an 
emergency or school
-
wide evacuation. The solar panel installation began in June 2014 and was completed in August 2014.  Installation of these pan
els 
were made in the 
main parking lot, providing additional cover over the parking spaces.  This project also provides movement
-
sensor lights to illuminate 
the parking lot after dark.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good rep
air and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that all 
classrooms, restrooms, and facilities are well
-
maintained and in good 
repair. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Stockton Unified takes great efforts to ensure that all schoo
ls are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, we utilize the facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California OPSC. The full report is available upon request.

in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta

significant cognitive disabilities); and

s calculated by taking the 
total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students w
ho met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who partici
pated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The 
number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, t
he number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level 
percentages are calculated using only students who received scores.
