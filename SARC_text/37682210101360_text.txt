Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Professional development is an on
-
gong process at ICS. The first 3 years as a school, professional training for the core 
programs at Integrity were provided by Developmental 
Studies Center. Developmental Studies Center(now Center for the 
Collaborative Classroom) continues to be a vital part of our school culture. We firmly believe in creating students who are 
responsible, respectful, caring, courteous and civic managed and The
 
Caring Community is the vehicle for teaching 
students this.
 
 
All teachers are trained in GLAD and Quantum learning strategies and deliver their instruction using these strategies. In 
addition as part of our teacher evaluation system teachers set goals for
 
professional development to improve their 
instruction.
 
 
Integrity Charter schools technology plan ensures teachers and students receive training in the ethical and proper use of 
technology. Technology use in the classroom is an important component to our 
professional development.
 
 
Teachers receive weekly Professional development. Every Wednesday afternoon is designated as professional 
development time. Teachers meet whole group, small group, in committees, and work collaboratively to discuss student 
progre
ss.  Teachers also meet in Unit Planning once a month, to look at student data to inform instruction and plan Units 
of Study.  This planning time is lead by our school's instructional coach
, Director
 
and Director.
