School Description
 
Welcome to Perry Elementary School! This report will provide parents and community members 
with information regarding achievement, resources, 
interventions, students and staff. We strive to 
ensure Perry is a welcome environment made only stronger by parent contributions. Collaboration 
with parents is a key to student success.
 
 
PERRY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MISSION STATEMENT:
 
Perry School will be an i
nspirational catalyst for the community unifying parents, teachers, and 
students to share, develop, and grow as life long learners. Perry School will promote individuality, 
the acceptance of diversity, and the formation of discipline, responsibility, coura
ge, and 

maintain high academic and moral standards, be critical thinkers, and problem solvers; thus 
enabling them to be confident, productive citizens.
 
 
PERRY E
LEMENTARY SCHOOL VISION STATEMENT:
 
We envision Perry Elementary School as a place where staff:
 

 
Work together in collaborative teams
 

 
Implement strategies to monitor and improve student achievement with on
-
going, 
research based strategies
 

 
Demonstrate a pers
onal commitment to the academic success and general well
-
being 
of all students
 

 
Encourage responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, trustworthiness, and respect
 

 
Work together to develop a strong partnership with families.
 

 
Provide a safe and nurturing e
nvironment
 
 
Joseph R. Perry Elementary has a long
-
standing tradition of excellence. Test scores continue to 
increase due to the dedication of all staff members and their ability to reach all students. The staff 
at Perry School is highly qualified and engage
s in on
-
going learning of the best interventions and 
research
-
based programs available to increase student achievement. Reading success has been the 
main focus for students and teachers. Teachers are skilled at assessing, diagnosing, and delivering 
instruc
tion in the five areas of reading: Phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and 
comprehension. Direct Interactive Instruction (DII) is also used as an instructional technique to 
support the implementation of the Common Core State Standards. ST Mat
h (JiJi), Number talks, 
and Cognitively
-
Guided Instruction (CGI) are being used to support the core math instruction. Social 
Studies and Science uses hands
-
on, inquiry
-
based techniques to make the curriculum come alive. 
All of the subject areas are support
ed by the use of technology. The staff carefully reviews 
intervention programs and teaching strategies so they can increase their repertoire of skills to meet 
the individual needs of students.

In addition, staff, students, families, and community members
 
at Perry Elementary have responded to the needs of our diverse student 
population by implementing a school
-
wide Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) program. The Perry K
-
5 STEM 
program is also coupled with model practices of interdisci
plinary integration of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). In 
alignment with our district's LCAP and the state of California's initiative to advance students' understanding of Science, Te
chnology, 
Engineering, and Mathematics. Perry Elementary st
udents are continuing to learn to become problem solvers, innovators, creators, and 
collaborators. STEM is being used as a vehicle to engage, motivate, and to create meaning for students. Professional Learning
 
Communities 
(PLC) and data driven instructiona
l practices are on
-
going practices that support student
-
learning objectives. Fifth grade science CST 
scores, benchmark data, and qualitative data reveal promising evidence that supports the school's STEM and NGSS implementatio
n.
 
 
All students are accepted 
and welcomed at Perry School. Perry School is proud of the diversity in ethnicity, economics, and learning styles. 
Perry Elementary School offers a program for the Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) , English Learners (EL), Title 1 studen
ts, and Special 
Education. Offerings in special education are combined creatively for the best possible Individual Education Plan (IEP) using
 
speech, 
specialized academic instruction, mainstreaming into regular education classes, full inclusion, social skills groups, occu
pational therapy, 
and/or adaptive P.E. to meet each child's unique needs. We work with the entire student population using the 40 Developmental
 
Assets 
Programs and our Perry Positive Behavior Intervention Systems (PBIS). We teach students that it is their 
right to be safe and happy at 
school and the need to respect other's rights to have the same.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of 
study

Parents and community members are always welcome to visit Perry school and encouraged to assist in the classroom. Collaborati
on between home and 
school is necessary for students to succeed. Parents are also encouraged to atten
d parent/teacher conferences held annually (this year in October). We 
hope families will find Perry a welcome environment made only stronger by everyone's contributions. Perry invites parents to 
be a part of the School Site 
Council (SSC), the Parent Teache
r Association (PTA), Title I, District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC) / District Advisory Committee (DAC) 
and/or volunteer in the classroom.
 
 
Additionally, Perry has events designed to encourage parent participation.  For the 2010

district to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The plan provides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 within
 
their safe school plans: 
current st
atus and assessment of school crime; identification of strategies and programs that provide and maintain a high level of scho
ol safety; child 
abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsi
on; notification to teachers; sexual 
harassment and discrimination policy; policies and procedures for the prevention of bullying; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and 
egress of pupils, parents, and school employees; safe and orderly sch
ool environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and makes any modifications as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Sa
fe School Plan, were 
reviewed with school and district staff at the beginning of
 
the 2019
-
20 school year. The plan was reviewed and updated with staff and School Site Council 
in early 2020.
 
 
The district progressively addresses structural needs at each school to ensure facilities are safe and comply with education 
codes as well as bui
lding and 
safety regulations. One automated external defibrillator (AED) was installed in the administration building. A $169 million b
ond (Measure Q) approved 
in November 2016 provides the necessary funding for District
-
 
wide modernization efforts. Perman
ent campus perimeter fencing was completed during 
2019
-
2020 school year to increase student safety.

The 
teaching/learning interaction is the cornerstone of a good instructional program leading to student academic success. To impr
ove the quality of the 
program, Perry School staff engage in staff development. Teaching is an on
-
going combination of art and skil
l and requires teachers to continually update 
their craft with the best teaching practices based on research. All training and curriculum development at Perry School revol
ves around the Common 
Core State Standards. Just as we hope for Perry students, Perry
 
teachers are lifelong learners.
 
 
Huntington Beach City School District regularly collaborates with all levels of district and school site staff when developin
g professional development 
activities in alignment with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Imp
roving Teacher Quality Expectations. district and school administrators use site 
trend analysis, state testing, district
-
level assessments, teacher response, and administrator observations to identify more effective methods and 
strategies to achieve positi
ve results for teachers and students.
 
 
The Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services and principals meet monthly to analyze current instructional programs, i
nstructional materials, 
implementation timelines, and student achievement. Feedback is gathe
red at the site level through direct input and staff observation. Periodic Curriculum 
Development Committees are formed to address identified areas of need and focus. District
-
level training activities and professional development are 
based both on school 
site needs and district needs. Currently, Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), Direct Interactive Instruction (DII), Number 
Talks, 
Spatial Temporal (ST) Math, and the implementation of the Common Core State Standards, the implementation of McGraw Hill "My
 
Math," and the 
implementation of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt "Journeys"  are focus areas for staff development.
 
 
On a weekly basis, the Perry school staff looks at the district and state assessment data, classroom portfolios, and work sam
ples to determine t
he needs 
of students. Each grade level makes recommendations for new additional strategies, training, or supplemental materials that m
ay help students in the 
learning process. Teachers align classroom curriculum to ensure that all students either meet or e
xceed the Common Core State Standards objectives. 
Articulation between grade levels helps to give consistency to the school program. Currently, the topics for staff developmen
t at Perry School include:  
Science Works, Technology, Research
-
based Title I Str
ategies, Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), Guided Language Acquisition Development (GLAD), 
Number Talks, ST Math, Factswise, Strategies for Reading and Writing by Nancy Fetzer, Response to Intervention (RTI), Thinkin
g Maps, Write From the 
Beginning, Pa
th to Proficiency, Direct Interactive Instruction (DII), and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt "Journeys."  Joseph R. Perry Elementar
y is also 
continuing to work on best practices with the implementation of the Common Core State Standards and the Next Generation S
cience Standards (NGSS).
 
 
A portion of school funds is used to enable staff members to attend teaching seminars and other events designed to enhance th
eir teaching techniques 
and expand their knowledge base. Teachers new to the profession are supported by 
peer coaching and are encouraged to attend in
-
services offered by 
the West Orange County Consortium for Special Education or education consultants. Teachers are encouraged to attend subject
-
specific seminars and 
major conferences and share what they learn 
with other staff members. The Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) program offers additional 
support and opportunities to new teachers. The program is designed to assist those new to teaching to expand and deepen their
 
teaching skills, help the 
school district retain more new teachers, and improve learning opportunities for students. Classified staff and instructional
 
assistants are provided 
training and development opportunities at the school, district, and county levels. In
-
services for classif
ied staff are geared to their specialty areas.

sh 
Language learners and other students at risk of failing. This funding also supports programs such as Language for Learning, T
hin
king and Writing, 
Houghton Mifflin Harcourt "Journeys", and Path to Proficiency.
 
 
The Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) program offers additional support and opportunities to new teachers. The
