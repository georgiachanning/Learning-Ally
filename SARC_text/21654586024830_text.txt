About the SARC
 
By Febru
ary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fundi
ng Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state a
nd local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the sch
ool, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Curriculum development is a district
-
wide effort. Teachers and administrators from all subject areas form working committees to draft recommendations 
on courses of study,
 
appropriate textbooks, and other instructional materials.
 
 
The California Department of Education has determined textbook selection and adoption schedules. The district follows the sta
te schedule for these 
adoptions and has purchased textbooks from the mo
st recent state
-
approved lists. All approved instructional materials are aligned with California content 
standards for core academic areas.
 
 
The Elementary School District Curriculum Advisory Council, composed of administrators, teachers, and parents repre
senting each school in the district, 
reviews curriculum recommendations and revisions for all courses of study, appropriate textbooks, and other materials utilize
d in the support of the 
instructional program. The Curriculum Council recommendations are forw
arded to the Board of Education for final approval. This is an ongoing process, 
assuring that all textbooks and instructional materials are systematically reviewed, updated, and supplemented.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
At San Pedro Elementary School, the campus is well maintained and students report that they feel safe at school. San Pedro en
sures that on
-
site 
supervision is provided for programs that take place both before and after school. Every morning, 25 minutes bef
ore school opens for instruction, staff 
provides supervision for all K
-
5 students during breakfast and recreation times. The after
-
school program is located on campus and operates Monday 
through Friday for three hours each day. Attendance is taken every da
y: absences are reported and checked on by the program director. The afterschool 
program is offered to fourth and fifth
-
grade students as well as a select number of second and third
-
graders who are performing academically below 
grade level. Additionally, o
ur after
-
school program is open to all students in first through fifth grades who reside in homeless shelters. This robust program 
focuses on academic intervention and enrichment that are directly tied to our adopted school day curriculum and instructional
 
practices.
 
 
District and school policy require that during the school day all guests to the San Pedro campus must sign in at the school o


ff members are required to wear photo ID badges. All students 
and faculty have reasonable amounts of classroom and open spaces that support a strong and enjoyable learning environment.
 
 
San Pedro Elementary School was originally opened in 1956 and then, af
ter being closed in 1970 due to declining enrollment, was renovated and 
reopened in 1991. The school has a total of 24 classrooms (18 permanent and six portable), a multipurpose facility, a music b
uilding, a library room, 
computer lab, and a student servic
es (administration) building. The school underwent modernization in 2005 with the use of voter
-
approved school bond 
funds and state modernization funds. Improvements included modernization of all existing classrooms, construction of a new li
brary/computer 
lab/classroom building, and construction of a new multipurpose building with a stage and two classrooms. Final facility impro
vements completed during 
the 2007
-
2008 school year included a field rehabilitation project to restore the field that was used as a 
staging area during construction of the new 
building. Most recent, during the summer of 2013, three new portable classrooms were added to the campus.

The district strives to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. All bathrooms, classroom
s, and offices are cleaned daily. Students are 
encouraged to help keep the campus clean by recycling. District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep 
the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. An onl

repairs are given the highest priority.

continues to make an annual contribution to support capital improvement projects,
 
including deferred maintenance projects.
 
 
San Rafael voters approved Measure A in November 2015 to fund capital facilities projects to improve our school facilities. M

SRCS' bond program is providing much needed capital improvements to our facilities to create safe, innovative learning enviro

instructional technology to support 21st century learning. Additional classrooms, labs and equipmen

overcrowding in our schools and to better meet the growing demand for hands

ies Team, have contributed greatly to shape the plans for these improvements, and the 
construction work is ongoing throughout the district.
