School Description
 
Jefferson Elementary School is an authorized International Baccalaureate (IB) Primary 
Years Programme 
School. This opportunity opens doors for children from around the district to enroll in an academic 
program that emphasizes global learning through the inquiry approach. In addition, students receive a 
second language option. Currently, thr
ough a multifaceted approach, students will receive direct 
instruction in Spanish by a credentialed Spanish teacher and classroom activities that give students the 
opportunity to read, write and speak in Spanish.  The teachers are trained in the IB program
 
and use the 
site
-
developed curriculum called Programme of Inquiry which includes the following themes: Who We 
Are, Where We Are in Space and Time, How We Express Ourselves, How the World Works, How We 
Organize Ourselves and Sharing the Planet. Students de
monstrate their mastery of state standards in 
ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies and Art within this framework.  In addition, Jefferson also provides 
many opportunities for students in the arts, science, technology, physical education, and community 
servic
e learning. During the instructional day, students receive weekly art, music, PE and 
garden/nutrition lessons.  Our Library Media Technician and Technology Instructional Assistant support 
students in researching topics, utilizing technology innovatively an

resources.  They also support students in digital citizenship and academic integrity.  Before school and 
afterschool electives provided by our teachers include Band, Makerspace, Ballet Folklorico, Beginning 
and Intermediate Spa
nish, Beginning and Intermediate American Sign Language, Kids for Peace, Soccer, 
Basketball, Running Club, Chess, Art, Yoga, and Drill Team.  In addition, our Genius Hour gives students 
an opportunity to participate in a project of their choosing.  Genius 
hour electives include:  KJEF news, 
Choir/Dance, Home Economics, Storm Water Pollution Prevention Program (SWPPP), STEAM, and 
Yearbook. Our very own award

the year as the Story Queen sp

-
5th provide 
hands
-
on experiences to support IB themes and give students authentic real world experiences.
 
 
All grade levels participate in programs throughout the year that allow them to focu
s on the environment 
and the world around them, as well as their place in it.  TK and Kindergarten focus on how things grow 
and change.  Both First and Second grade participate in our award
-
winning programs focused on 
environmentalism as well as looking at
 

conduct environmental studies in the local lagoons and learn about the native habitat. Fourth graders 
learn about local and California history and resources.  Fifth graders learn about entrepreneu
rship at the 

collaborative project in which they identify, investigate and offer solutions to real
-
life issues or problems.  
Kids for Peace, now a worldwi
de organization started at Jefferson, is another one of our award winners, 
which continues to provide for those in need while bolstering up the message that peace starts with me. 
Other school
-
wide projects include monthly IB Rallies, Healthy Choices Week, 
Safety Awareness Week, 
the Great Kindness Challenge, the annual talent show, and the Olympics.
 
 
Jefferson continues to offer a fitness program aptly named Motion: Fitness for the body, mind, and spirit. 
This is a daily exercise program, or Work Out of the 
Day (WOD), which encourages higher levels of fitness 
and mindfulness to ensure that students are better prepared for the learning environment. Our school 
boasts dedicated teachers, vested community support, and student/family school connectedness, which 
re
sults in high achievement. At Jefferson, we are committed to providing a rigorous, well
-
rounded 
curriculum that not only supports the academic growth of every student, but also the social and 
emotional growth, developing each child as a life
-
long learner a
nd contributing citizen of our school 
community.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Our School Site Council (SSC), which includes five elected parent members, meets throughout the year to support all school pr
ograms and initiatives and 

r Student Achievement (SPSA) plan and site budget. In addition, our English Learner Advisory Council (ELAC) 
brings parents of students who are learning English into leadership and committee positions at the site. Our school PTA, with
 
the support of a team 
of 
volunteer coordinators, Jefferson parents, and community members, works hard to provide programs, activities, and events that
 
benefit students and 
foster a sense of community with parents, students, and staff.  Our monthly Coffee with the Principal prov
ides a forum for parents and community to 
meet with the principal and discuss relevant and timely topics and ideas. Parents are always invited into the school to volun
teer, visit, and to attend 
programs.
 
 
Other parent and community involvement includes the
 
support of the Urban Youth Collaborative, North Coast Calvary Chapel, Christian Surfers, Village 
Presbyterian Church, Concrete and Canvas, Agrarian Craft Landscape, Costco, Lowe's, Sage Garden Project, USAopoly, Assistance
 
League, and the Rotary.  
Through
 
these partnerships, Jefferson has benefited from school beautification, much needed PE and recess equipment, backpacks and sc
hool supplies 
for every student, reading programs, holidays dinners for needy children, and book giveaways for all Jefferson stude
nts. Parents volunteer in the

School Safety Plan
 
We revise and update our school safety plan each year in the fall. Our current school safety plan meets all federal, state, a
nd dist
rict standards for a 
comprehensive school safety plan. It addresses prevention, planning, responding, and recovering from possible threats (earthq
uakes, intruders,  fires) to 
ensure the safety of students, staff, and visitors. Our counselors, psychologists
, and site administrators are extensively trained in threat assessment 
techniques by nationally recognized experts in school
-
threat assessment. To ensure safety on our campus, a school site safety committee conducts 
inspections to identify potential hazard
s. We have also developed a disaster preparedness plan, and we conduct regular fire and earthquake drills to
