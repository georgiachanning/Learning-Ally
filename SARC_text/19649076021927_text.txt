School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-

Message from Principal:
 
Welcome to Barfield Elementary School! We are
 
a learning community of scholars and educators. Our aim is to prepare 
each and every one of our Scholars to be college or career ready by providing them with high quality instruction and 
assisting them in setting social and academic goals. We strive for e
xcellence through a collaborative environment that 
makes decisions based on achievement data as well as individualized needs of our diverse student population.
 
 
My practice and philosophy is to work collaboratively with staff, parents and students and hold
 
high expectations for all. 
My goal is to continue to make Barfield Elementary a wonderful place for students to learn and an exceptional place for 
teachers to work. My aim is to foster a warm, innovative and dynamic learning environment that offers a bala
nced and 
rigorous curriculum, the latest technology and resources, and provides students a World Class Education. My pledge is to 
work tirelessly and closely with teachers and staff, our amazing students, and our parent community to accomplish this 
goal.
 
 
One of the most important components of a great school is the partnership between the school and parents who work 
together for the best interest of children. A close partnership between home and school is a heartfelt goal that is coming 
to fruition at Barf
ield Elementary School.
 
 

 
Students will develop into literate, self
-
 
motivated critical thinkers with a desire to explore challenging opportunities for 
improvement and advancement.
 
 

 
Barfield Elementary School will 
maximize student learning through community collaboration and partnership to foster 
achievement in academic standards and social responsibilities.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety: Safety of the students and staff is a priority at Pomona Unified School District. All schools in the district are in 
compliance with all laws, rules and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials. Staff training is ongoing throughout the 
school 
year and a disaster preparedness plan is in place for earthquakes and emergency evacuations. All buildings within 
the district are in compliance with state earthquake standards. A discipline policy may be found at each school that seeks 
to insure a safe an
d orderly environment for students and staff. A Safe School Plan has been adopted, and it includes 
policies on disaster preparedness, student discipline, the components of a safe and orderly school environment, 
suspension/expulsion procedures, safety, chil
d abuse reporting procedures, student dress codes, and student and staff 
sexual harassment.
 
 
Barfield Elementary School has embraced PBIS, Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports which emphasizes three 
school
-
wide expectations of all:  1) Be Safe; 2) 
Be Kind; 3) Be Responsible. In addition, a school
-
wide discipline plan has 
been implemented ensuring that students receive multiple opportunities to re
-
adjust their behavior and choose to make 
better choices. Consequences are clearly posted and students kn
ow how they are doing throughout the day. The School 
Plan is shared and adjusted monthly to create more opportunities for students to be successful.

department colleagues to enhance instruction and assessment.   These focus areas are in direct alignment with federal, 
state, and district student achievement academic goals. 
In addition to the district

sites use their weekly late start Friday sessions, 2 additional hours per month, and 4 additional hours per year (once per 
semester), to analyze student achievement data in a collegial forum. 
They then design effective instructional interventions

District and site professional development also includes trainings around 21st Century Teaching and Learning which 
include the California State Standards and the P21 Framework. Tra

teacher leaders to lead the transition and implementation of the California State Standards. Sessions include themes such 
as the need for a paradigm shift in teaching and learning, the essential componen
ts of the P21 Framework, California State 
Standards, English Learner standards and framework, equity and culturally responsive instruction, social and emotional 
learning, and integrating the use of technology to enhance/support instruction and learning. Pe
