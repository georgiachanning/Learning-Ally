About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availabil
ity of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes fo
r all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether th
ose books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far more meaningful when along with 

mes of the t
extbooks used 
in our core classes and their dates of publication.

School Fa
cility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Each school site has classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library and an administration building. The number of classrooms at e
ach school site varies, 
depending on enrollment and available space. 
Rio Calaveras School was built in 1999.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that e
mergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that all classrooms, restrooms, and facilities are 
well
-
maintained and in good 
repair. The principal works daily with the custodial 
staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Stockton Unified takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, we
 
utilize the facility survey instrument 
developed by the St
ate of California OPSC. The full report is available upon request.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 

ures the school facilities 
are in compliance with all federal and sta
te health and safety regulations. Each year a deep cleaning process occurs during a close of school, either during 
the summer or other extended breaks. In the event of a facility plant emergency, the principal notifies appropriate site and 
district personn
el to resolve 
the emergency and safely secure or evacuate the students, based upon the site and district emergency preparedness plans. A si
te review with the district 
Internal Evaluation Instrument (IEI) occurs annually.
 
 
A comprehensive School Safety Plan
, which was reviewed by our teachers on August 11, 2015 and our School Site Council on May 27, 2015, helps to 

 
procedures to follow
 
during emergencies and natural disasters. Emergency drills are conducted on a regular basis.
 
 
Every effort is made to ensure students are monitored while on campus throughout the school day. Yard supervisors, teachers, 
site administrators and 
school staff
 
provide supervision for students before and during school. The playground is safe for all students. All visitors must sign in
 
at the office and 
receive proper authorization to be on campus, and must display their passes at all times.
 
 
Our staff and studen
ts are trained in emergency operations through drills and table top exercises as well as classroom discussions. Students are 
informed 
of expectations during each drill by their teachers prior to us having the drills and are reminded each time they are repe
ated. Our staff is trained at staff 
meetings and we have practice drills monthly.
 
 
Our staff and students participate in a Positive Behavior Plan across all grade levels at Rio Calaveras.  Students are taught
 
lesson that provide them with 
expectations for 
behavior in the classroom and all common areas such as playgrounds, bathrooms, halls, and cafeteria at the beginning of every
 
school 
year.  Expectations are taught and practiced over the first two weeks of each new school year and reviewed with students by
 
classroom teachers when 
we return from every school break.  The three tenets for behavior at Rio Calaveras are Safe, Respectful and Responsible.  Our
 
mascot is a river otter and 
our students earn "Otter Be Awesome" tickets for good behavior that goes into
 
a weekly drawing for prizes.  Rio has had very little instances where we 
have had to call in the authorities since implementing this plan.  This plan is reviewed annually with teachers, staff, stude
nts and parents and throughout 
the year as needed.
