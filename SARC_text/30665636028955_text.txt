School Description
 
Imperial Middle School is proud of our strong school culture that supports achievement for all students. As a 
Professional Learning Community (PLC), our goals are to provide students with the finest educational 
experience possible and to ensure student suc
cess in the 21st century. The staff is dedicated to providing a 
warm, student
-
centered climate that supports a smooth transition from childhood to adolescence for our 
middle school students. Instruction is both rigorous and standards
-
based with high expect
ations for all 
students.
 
 
Our staff is committed to providing the best quality education for our students. As we begin our educational 
journey this year, we are continuing with our candidacy to become an International Baccalaureate Middle 
Years Program 
World School. The IB program is open to all Imperial students and will provide many new 
opportunities for academic success. The IB program is unique because of its academic and personal rigor, 
challenging students to excel in their studies and personal gro
wth.
 
 
The IB Middle Years Program (MYP) offers a high
-
quality program of international education that shares a 
powerful vision. An IB education:
 

 
Focuses on learners 

 

-
centered program promotes healthy relationships, ethical 
responsibility 
and personal challenge.
 

 
Develops effective approaches to teaching and learning 

 
the IB Program helps students to 
develop the attitudes and skills they need for both academic and personal success.
 

 
Works within global contexts 

 
the IB program increases und
erstanding of languages and 
cultures, and explores globally significant ideas and issues.
 

 
Explores significant content 

 
the IB program offers a curriculum that is broad and balanced, 
conceptual and connected.
 
Informed by values described in the learner pr
ofile, IB MYP learners strive to become inquirers, 
knowledgeable, thinkers, communicators, principled, open
-
minded, caring, risk
-
takers, balanced, and 
reflective.
 
 
Most students learn best when they can apply their studies to the world around them. The IB 
Middle Years 
Program places a high value on this type of immersive learning and promotes a learning environment that 
embraces real
-
world applications in all of its studies. To do so, the MYP focuses on eight core subject areas. 
According to IBO.org, these 

 
 
These subject areas include:
 
 
1. Language Acquisition
 
2. Language and Literature
 
3. Individuals and Societies
 
4. Sciences
 
5. Mathematics
 
6. Arts
 
7. Physical and Health Educat
ion
 
8. Design
 
 
In addition, Imperial Middle School integrates the arts throughout the curriculum. Project Based Learning 
Projects are planned and managed to help students learn key academic concepts. Students are also given the 
opportunity to select electi
ve classes including band, chorus, art (drawing and painting), ceramics, piano, 
media arts, theater arts, percussion, PALS, and ASB.
 
 
Mission/Vision Statement
 
 
The mission of Imperial Middle School is to empower all students with the skills and knowledge 
to become 
compassionate, inquisitive, principled young people who create a more peaceful world through global 
awareness, critical thinking, and a commitment to action and service.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Each year the District looks at student achievement data along with 
teacher requests 
for specific trainings to determine the plan for the four 
Districtwide professional development days.  In 2017
-
2018, training 
focused on new English Language Arts adoptions, Wonders and Amplify.  
In 2018

Tiered System of 
Supports (MTSS).
 
 
In addition to the Districtwide trainings, each site works with a consultant 
from InnovateEd to develop Cycles of Inquiry around their strategic focus.  
Teac
her leaders attend seven days of training to analyze student data, 
develop a strategic focus for the year, implement evidence based lessons, 
and analyze student work.  Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSAs) 
assigned to each site work with all teachers thro
ughout the year during the 
school day and during PLC time to support implementation of the strategic 
focus.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil sus

Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
One of the most important goals at Imperial Middle School is to establish 
and maintain a safe, healthy, and positive school environment. In 
compliance with SB 187, Imperial Middle School has designed a 
comprehensive Site Safety Plan, which was approved by the School Site 
Council. The goals for the safety plan are:
 

 
Provide a safe teaching and learning environment for all 
students and staff memb
ers.
 

 
All gates/fences are locked for additional safety.
 

 
Keep all students safe and secure at school, traveling to and 
from school, and at school
-
related activities.
 

 
Provide district programs and community resources to 
students and parents.
 

 
Imperial prides 
itself on providing an educational environment 
where students, parents, staff, and community members 
participate respectfully without regard to race, culture, or 
religious background.
 

 
Imperial is a safe, closed campus with a minimum number of 
distractions 
each year. Staff and administration monitor the 
campus from 7:45 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. each day. We also have 
a School Resource Officer on campus during the school day 
to provide additional help in the event of an emergency.
 

 
We practice fire and disaster drill
s routinely to prepare for any 
emergency. Imperial currently has a three
-
day food and 
water supply for our students and staff in the event of an 
emergency.

Imperial Middle School recognizes how crucial parent 
involvement is to student success. A successful school is one in which parents are active members 
of the school community. We strongly encourage parents to get involved and participate in school activities. We have many way
s for parents to 
participate and 
we depend on parents to keep many of our programs running smoothly. Some of the activities designed to increase parent involv
ement 
include: PTA, ELAC, Coffee with the Administration, School Site Council, Family Nights, Parent Nights, IB Information Nights,
 
Student
-
led Conferences, 
Back
-
to
-
School Night, and Open House. Our community liaison facilitates and supports our parent involvement program throughout the ye
ar.

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter
 
Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

) appear in the table
 
when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistic
al 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test
 
whether they received a score or not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.
