By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
District Vision
 
It is the vision for each student to become a 
life
-
long learner and productive citizen, leading a fulfilled life. Included in the 
vision of the Charter is the drive to enable students to become educated citizens who will be literate, have problem
-
solving 
skills, be self
-
motivated, able to utilize tech
nology, and become socially responsible.  Our mission is simple, "We will find 
a way for ALL students to learn!"
 
 
Central Valley Home School (formerly known as, Kingsburg Community Charter Extension) was established to partner with 
parents who choose to ho
meschool their children. We believe that education must be REAL to be maximized.  REAL means 
relevant, enriching, and accountable for learning to take place.  CVHS' provides credentialed teachers to partner with our 
parents in the homeschool journey.  Mast
er teachers provide assistance in curriculum selection, pacing, research topics, 
courses of study, as well as encouragement. We want to give our parents as much support as possible so they can spend 
their time investing in the education of their children. 
When a child enrolls with CVHS, their entire family joins with us and 
becomes part of ours.
 
 
When you visit our school, you will see that everything about our school has been designed with the intention to allow 
parents to fully participate in the successf
ul education of their children. We take our task seriously and strive to make 
education both enriching and engaging.
 
 
Keeping it REAL,
 
Misti Jennings, Principal, Central Valley Home School

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
November 2019
 
 
Kingsburg Elementary Charter School District holds a Public Hearing quarterly and determines that each school within the 
District has sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional
 
materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the 
settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual 
Standards
-
aligned curriculum, textbooks and/or instructional materials, in cor
e subjects for use in the classroom and to 
take home. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the school are aligned with the California State Content 
Standards and Frameworks.
 
 
Students visit a library on campus that houses thousands of book
s to further enrich their academic experience.  Students 
at CVHS are also provided a Chromebook in an effort to increase our tech to student ratio to 1:1.
 
 
Computer skills and concepts integrated throughout standard curriculum prepare students for technolo
gical growth and 
opportunities. In addition, we offer online learning opportunities for our students using companies such as Edgenuity, 
Google, Raz Kids, Reading A
-
Z, and other educational programs.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Central Valley Home School was originally constructed in 1994. The Central Valley Home School campus is currently 
comprised of two classrooms, a library,  a staff PLC workroom, and teacher work 
cubicles.
 
 
Cleaning Process: The principal works with the custodial staff to ensure that the cleaning of the school is maintained to 
provide for a clean and safe school. The District Governing Board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the 
Dis
trict. A summary of these standards is available at the District Office for review.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and work orders are completed in a timely manner.
 
 
A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and the highest priority are given to emergency repairs.
 
 
The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides State
-
matching funds on a 
dollar 
-
for
-
dollar basis
, to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school 
building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or 
exterior painting, and floor syste
ms.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents and the 
community are very supportive of the education program at Central Valley Home School. Upon enrolling 
the student the parent agrees to meet with a credentialed teacher a minimum of every 20 school days.  In addition to this 
meeting, we also check in mid
-
mon
th as a way to keep the communication flowing. These meetings are held to discuss 
student progress, review work samples and serve as an opportunity for the parent to gain any support regarding academics

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Central Valley Home School provides a safe, clean, and welcoming environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The 
safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Central Valley Home School. The school is 
always in compliance with 
the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and State earthquake standards. At the beginning of the 
year, the District Leadership team meets to review safety issues. Key elements of the safety plan include i
dentifying the 
level of threat, protective options, staff initial action/ response, incident coordinator, and identification of an incident 
management team.
 
 
Students are supervised throughout the day by parents and teachers. Visitors are required to sign 
in at the office and 
receive identification badges that must be displayed at all times. Kingsburg Elementary Charter School District encourages 
volunteers in the classroom, field trips, and special projects. All school volunteers in direct contact with stu
dents are 
required to complete a District application form, provide evidence of clear tuberculosis (TB) screening, and receive a 

Volun
teers working more than 10 days per month will need to fill out additional forms and submit to fingerprinting.
 
 
The School Safety Plan was last reviewed, updated, and discussed with the school faculty and site council on October 30, 
2019.

Staff members build teaching skills and concepts through participation in conferences and workshops throughout the 
year.  Professional Development the past year has focused on our district writing 
development.  Experts from Tulare 
County Office of Education have been contracted to provide technical assistance to staff to help enrich our writing 
program.  In addition, we continue to implementing guided reading across the curriculum and in every class
room as well 
as administering the Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA) and utilizing those results to guide instruction.  Teachers 
have attended full day and half day trainings specifically focused on the implementation of guided reading to help our 
stud
ents build those pivotal foundational skills as part of a balanced literacy program.  Administrators and members of 
the academic leadership team participate in on

in verticle teams to really understand the "oxygen" of writing the student will need as they prepare to enter the next grade 
level.
