By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg

.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

MISSION STATEMENT
 
Maple Elementary School offers an inclusive environment that promotes kindness, acceptance, and inclusion of all 
students ,parents, and staff.
 
 
SCHOOL DESCRIPTION
 
Maple 
Elementary School opened its doors in 1970 and is home to about 300 students and over 50 staff members. Maple 
has been an integral part of the community and is located on a large, beautiful, split
-
level site in an established residential 
area. Surrounded b
y a neighborhood constituted of families and local businesses, Maple Elementary School is a 
neighborhood school with strong community roots.  The philosophy that drives our decisions regarding instruction is 
summarized in our Mission Statement: Maple Eleme
ntary School is dedicated to creating socially conscious student 
leaders and independent students, supported by our school community, in an inclusive school environment, where every 
student demonstrates kindness,acceptance, and inclusion. During the summer
 
of 2019, ten classrooms were relocated to 
promote increased collaboration among our students and teachers receiving services in both specialized academic 
instruction and general education classrooms. This was a shift from the previous location of all SAI 
classrooms in one 
location. Our 2019
-
2020 School year launched with every student having a seat in the general education classroom and  
with access to grade level peers through intentional planning by both the SAI and GE teacher. We are dedicated to 
promot
ing a least restricted environment for each of our students at Maple.
 
 
In alignment of our CVUSD LCAP Goal #1 (Implement targeted actions and services that support positive student 
outcomes), we are focused on increasing English Language Arts, Math, and Sc
ience achievement by implementing high 
quality Tier One instruction for all students(including GATE, EL, SED, SWD, and Foster Youth), using the district
-
adopted 
resources. Students in third through fifth grade have opportunities to support differentiated r
eading comprehension 
practice through Achieve 3000, an online software. Achieve 3000 also provides students with enrichment opportunities, 
and will adjust based on student performance and teacher feedback. Students in Kindergarten and Third Grade are 
learn
ing how to be empower students to monitor their own learning, through the teachers' exploration of Impact Teams. 
Language support is provided for our English Learners on a daily basis, through Newcomer Instruction, Carousel, and 
Rosetta Stone, in addition 
to instruction from each classroom teacher using visuals, and high leverage language strategies. 
Intervention opportunities at Maple include  reading and math intervention consistent with district framework, for 
students whose EASY CBM and benchmark data h
as shown that they are at risk in those areas. This instruction is delivered 
by certificated teachers. Students have access to online resources to support skills maintenance and intervention using 
Raz Kids. Enrichment opportunities at Maple include enrichm
ent classes in our S.T.E.A.M. Lab that all students access, 
promoting students engagement in the arts and sciences. We shifted from a science lab to a Maker Space, and now have 
combined the Maker Space with a focus on Science, Technology, Engineering, the 
Arts, Mathematics, and Innovation. Our 
goal is to inspire our students to take risks, create, innovate, explore the impossible, in a risk free, collaborative 
environment. An Innovation Grant that was awarded to Maple in Spring, 2019, affording us the oppor
tunity to purchase 
a class set of Google Expedition Goggles, and engineering and coding experiences for our students. All instruction is 
delivered by a certificated teacher. Other enrichment opportunities for students(including GATE, EL, SED, SWD, and 
Home
less/Foster Youth) throughout the year include Earth Day, Chalk Art Day, Recycling Education by parent experts, 
GATE activities during lunch accessible to all students, after school GATE field trips, library access during recess, 
Shakespeare Play, Computer
, Art, Music, Dance, PE Instruction, classroom plays, and visits from our local fire and police 
department.

In alignment of our C.V.U.S.D. LCAP Goal #2 (Ensure staff is provided with targeted professional development and has an 
understanding that all job 
responsibilities are structured to support positive student outcomes), all of our staff is 
committed to engaging in professional development focused on Universal Design for Learning, data analysis, collaboration 
planning between SAI and GE teachers, Sanfor
d Harmony (SEL), and the school
-
wide use of See Saw, for students to 
monitor their learning, and a tool for teachers to communicate learning during the day with parents. All teachers also 
participated and are committed to implementing "Let Yourself Grow", 
a replacement for homework every Monday night, 
where students(including GATE, EL, SED, SWD, and Homeless/Foster Youth) are encouraged to learn something new, with 
the guidance of their parents. Each week, students(including GATE, EL, SED, SWD, and Homeless
/Foster Youth) have 
opportunities to journal about what they are learning to do. This is a risk
-
free, non graded experience. Our goal is to 
empower students to create "Let Grow Moments" as often as they are motivated, and in ways that motivate them. 
Teache
rs in K and 1 are participating in a District English Learner Training throughout the year. Teachers in K and 3 are 
participating in District Impact Team training this year, to promote student ownership and monitoring of learning. 
Teachers in 3
-
5 are being
 
trained in the use and implementation of Achieve 3000 with their students. Two of our SAI 
teachers will participate in a UCLA professional Training on Classroom Pivotal Response Teaching. In addition, optional 
technology training will be offered for the u
se of Promethean Boards, to support the six new boards purchased through 
Measure I funds.
 
 
In alignment with our C.V.U.S.D. LCAP Goal #3 (Provide communication and targeted outreach that informs the community 
of programs and opportunities that 
support positive student outcomes), our Maple Parent Faculty Association is very 
active and committed to providing our families with opportunities to engage in positive, collaborative experiences with 
students, parents, and families at Maple. The year kick
ed off with a Cookies and Classrooms the night before school 
started, a picnic and movie night, and our first school fundraiser. Other monthly activities, such as Trunk or Treat, our Fal
l 
Maple, Stampede Jog

a
-
thon, Craft Fair, Movie nights, a School Dance
, Bingo Night, Book Fair Night, and More. Our Maple 
PFA works closely with other committee leaders and the principal to publish a unified weekly Sunday evening newsletter, 
filled with information from P.F.A., school committees,and the school, as  well as t
o collaborate on a parent handbook 
published for all families. All communication sent home is translated into Spanish, and our weekly newsletter can be 
translated in many different languages. We have an active group of  volunteers who support these events,
a s well as 
support in our classrooms. We love our Maple volunteers!
 
 
In alignment with our C.V.U.S.D. LCAP Goal #4 (Enhance the social, emotional and physical well being for all students, 
through targeted action that support positive student outcome), our
 
theme at Maple continues to promote a feeling that 
"ALL are WELCOME HERE", that "WE are so glad YOU are Here", and one of Kindness, Acceptance,and inclusion. Our 
vehicle for this is through the lens that we are all superheroes and have the Power to Choose
 
(P2C) good choices that 
promote kindness, acceptance and inclusion. Superhero clothes are often seen worn by staff and students on 
Wednesdays,  Shirts that promote inclusion and autism acceptance are worn on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and Maple 
Mustang schoo
l spirit shirts are worn by all on Fridays! Leadership opportunities such as Mustang Mentors promotes 
student leadership of younger peers, and peer mentoring, where every student in the school has a buddy to collaborate 
with throughout the year,in structur
ed experiences designed by our SAI and GE teacher partners. Social Emotional 
Education and skills are important for us at Maple. We understand the importance of teaching students the skills they 
need to successfully navigate peer relationships. Students pa
rticipate in monthly assemblies led by Katie Berry, focused 
on social emotional themes, such as Sandy Hooks, Say Hello. In collaboration with our counselor and principal, Maple 
hosted our first Fall painting Night, as an activity on Let Yourself Grown Nigh
t, to promote a love of the Arts in a shared 
experience with parents. In collaboration with SEDAC (our Special Education District Advisory Committee, and Katie Berry, 
the Pacer Center led students in "Bully Education",as well as taught preventative skills 
that promote kindness, acceptance 
and inclusion, in a Unity Day Assembly and rock painting project. Not only did we create a Unity Tree for our rocks to 
surround, students will participate in experiences education around Disabilities Awareness and Autism A
wareness. With 
the installation of two new inclusive playground on our site, our students are able to successfully engage in a variety of 
sensory opportunities that promote collaboration and exploration, thanks to Measure I funds.

elf to be my best, to do this every moment I 
can. If I make a mistake, I forgive myself, and move on. I am neat kind and a hard worker. I am lovable, capable,and proud 
to be me. I am a Maple Mustang,and I model the way to succeed." In the spirit of inclusi
on, we added,"  A rainbow of 
friends is a dream that we share, where everyone's treated with kindness and care."  We are proud to be Maple Mustangs!

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
January 2020
 
 
All TK
-
12 students have current 
standards
-
based textbooks in math, science, history/social science, and English/language 
arts. With each curricular cycle established by the State of California, the Conejo Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) 
Board of Education adopts textbooks within t
he timeline provided. Standards
-
aligned books for grades 9
-
12 are approved 
locally. Textbooks in grades K
-
8 are selected from lists of books and materials approved by the State Board of Education. 
Sufficient standards
-
based textbooks and instructional mate
rials have been purchased for all students in English, math, 
history/social science, science, health and foreign language. In addition, annually, sites receive specific science 
supplementary funds to be used for consumable laboratory expenses and/or equipm
ent.
 
 
The process of selecting textbooks and materials involves the formation of a committee charged with the responsibility of 
reviewing current state standards and frameworks, analyzing student data, writing courses of study (as required) and 
selecting a
nd maintaining current instructional materials. The goal of such district
-
wide committees comprised of teachers 
and administrators representing all targeted grade levels, is to achieve high academic standards for all of our TK
-
12 
students. Each major subje
ct area, such as math, science, history/social science, foreign language and English/language 
arts, is reviewed and adopted under the guidance of the California Department of Education and State Board of Education. 
The committee submits its recommendations
 
to the Board of Education for final approval. The recommendation to the 
Board includes the basic textbook materials as well as supplementary materials within the subject. On October 1, 2019, 
the CVUSD Board of Education approved a resolution for the 2019
-
2020 school year declaring that the Conejo Valley 
Unified School District has provided each pupil with sufficient standards
-
based textbooks and instructional materials 
consistent with the cycles and content of the curriculum frameworks.

Each fall, a team that consists of all or many of the following personnel, inspects each school in the Conejo Valley Unified 
School District:  Sit
e Administrator, Director of Maintenance and Operations, Director of Planning and New Construction, 
and the Assistant Superintendent.  A facilities evaluation is completed documenting the condition of the school in a variety 
of areas including the cleanlin
ess of restrooms, condition of roofs, paving and walkways, HVAC systems, landscape 
maintenance, etc.  Any observed condition that represents a threat to the health and safety of students and staff is 
annotated for immediate correction.  Notes include items
 
that could improve the utility, appearance, sustainable

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs 
of study.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT
 
 
Maple Elementary has an active Parent Faculty Association (PFA), School Site Council (SSC), and English Language Advisory 
Council (ELAC).  These leadership bodies help 
set the goals of the school and actively work to increase parent involvement 
on campus.  SSC and ELAC oversee the creation, implementation, and evaluation of Maple's  SPSA during their regularly
-
scheduled meetings, all of which are open to the public. Pare
nts have many involvement opportunities and representation 
through School Site Council (SSC), our English Language Advisory Council (ELAC) along with Parent Education classes 
facilitated by our Bilingual Facilitator, EL Teacher Facilitator,and Principal, c
ommunity partnerships, and our Parent 
Teacher Association (PFA). Parents are also encouraged to volunteer at school and attend events. Our Special Education 
District Advisory Council (SEDAC) representatives offer involvement and connection opportunities fo
r parents.Maple has 
an active Site SEDAC team, who is very involved in all aspects of Maple.   Maple's  parent DAC and DELAC representatives 
participate in district
-
level meetings and report back to SSC and ELAC, enriching our district
-
site level communica
tion. Our 
Maple School Site Council actively participated in two SPSA Planning days, in order to draft the goals for our school this 
year. Parents from most subgroups participated and the group not represented was communicated to, in order to provide 
feedb
ack on the goals drafted. School Site Council will review the final draft of the SPSA at our meeting on November 20.  
All parents were notified of these meetings and encouraged to attend via the school weekly newsletter, that is published 
in many languages
.
