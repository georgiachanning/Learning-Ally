About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Our teachers actively seek opportunities for professional growth to provide effective instruction with the focus on student l
earning.  Staff development 
is based on the assessed needs of the students 
and the school personnel and is currently focusing on the adoption of the Common Core State Standards 
with Swun Math, Thinking Maps, and Write From the Beginning and Beyond,  ELA/ELD instruction. Staff members work collaborativ
ely to determine the 
school's
 
needs and take direction from District and State requirements when establishing professional development goals for the school
 
year.  School
-
wide training focus areas include technology, English language arts, writing across the curriculum, math, different
iation,NGSS science instruction and 
using data to drive instruction. Staff members build teaching skills and concepts by participating in many conferences and wo
rkshops throughout the 
year and by sharing their experiences and knowledge with colleagues. The
 
District offers professional development funds to school sites for professional 
development activities, NGSS Science, processed writing,and data analysis are examples of district wide professional developm
ent.
