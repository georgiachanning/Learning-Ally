About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about 
the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educ
ational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or t
he district office.

cafeteria. Each classroom is equipped w
ith built

in computer counters. Our building is in good repair and the grounds are in good condition.  The staff 
keeps things clean and in working order. A portable building, which serves as our Family Center, was installed in 1994 and in
cludes an office, 
and a 
multipurpose area

used for playgroup and after
-
school activities. In 2002, a new floor was installed in the Family Center. Hoaglin

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

All District teachers are encouraged to participate in professional development each year.  District teachers are encouraged 
to participate in professional 
development activities such as trainings and workshops via the internet or off campus sites such as 
in Redding or Eureka. The District routinely pays for 
registration and travel costs as well as providing substitutes for participating teachers.
 
 
Recent areas of staff development include Capturing Kids' Hearts, (December 2018) development of Multi
-
Tiered 
Systems of Support training for the
