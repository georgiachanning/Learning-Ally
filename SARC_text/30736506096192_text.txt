School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud

Stonegate is fortunate to have
 
the support of an active group of parents who devote their time and talents to promote 
activities and events for our students. Our PTA assists in community building, planning, and providing financial support, 
not available by other means, which improves t
he quality of learning and increases opportunities for enrichment for all 
students. Parents are encouraged to attend meetings and support activities.  Dates and times of meetings and activities 
will be posted on the PTA link of the Stonegate website at www
.iusd.org/sg.
 
 
Parents are also encouraged to become involved in any and all school related events.  Parents who volunteer in 
classrooms, the library, and other areas of the school provide a valuable service that is greatly appreciated.  Please contac
t 
you

our overall school community.

At Stonegate, we are constantly concerned for the safety and welfare of each of our students. We hold regular drills to 
teach children the appropriate way to safely exit the building in the event
 

earthquake, and to respond to lockdowns (both for emergency situations and emergency situations). The school is fully 
equipped with search and rescue materials, first aid supplies, food, and water. Staff a
re assigned emergency preparedness 
roles and undergo specific training as needed. Our school staff is prepared to deal with a major emergency and to provide 
for the physical and emotional needs of students while they are under our supervision, as well as t
heir orderly and safe 
release.
 
 
Stonegate has developed a comprehensive Safe School Plan. Our plan is evaluated yearly and amended, as needed by the 
SSC and school safety planning committee. Key elements of the plan include: 1. Assessing the current status
 
of school

The Stonegate staff is highly dedicated to ongoing 
professional growth.  Each year our teachers participate in twelve hours 
of on

day district
-
wide professional developments.  The division 
of the twelve hours varies from year
-
to

year.  For this schoo
l year, six hours of professional development will take place 
during one pupil free day.  The remaining six hours will be spent in three, two
-
hour after school sessions.  We continue 
our focus on Professional Learning Communities, building 21st century ski

social
