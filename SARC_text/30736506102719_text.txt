By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Located in the village of Northwood, Brywood Elementary School has an enrollment of 568 students in grades kindergarten 
through
 
sixth. Our unique community is comprised of many ethnic groups and a variety of languages are spoken among 
our students and Brywood families. We offer a wide range of educational settings for our students, Specific Academic 
Instruction (SAI), General Educ
ation, Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) and an Alternative Program for Academically 
Accelerated Students (APAAS). Our school is an unique and dynamic learning community, as we believe that every person, 
every learner, every culture has something to off
er to the educational experience. I am pleased to present Brywood 

 
 
Under the provisions of Proposition 98, schools in California are required to prepare an annual School Accountability 
Report Card assessing our scho
ol in a variety of performance areas. The purpose of the school profile is to inform our 
school community about the conditions and progress made at Brywood during the 2019
-
2020 school year. Our profile also 
provides an excellent opportunity for us to ident
ify the strengths and challenges of our school program and to engage our 
school community in discussing our vision and improvement efforts.
 
 
As you read through our profile, you will find a school with an impressive record of consistently strong achievemen
t and 
a faculty committed to meeting the needs of all students. During this year, Brywood staff continued its implementation of  
Response to Instruction (RtI) and Professional Learning Communities (PLC) as a collaborative effort to improve teaching 
and ins
tructional strategies. We continued to receive coaching from our district TOSA ensuring the fidelity of RtI and the 
commitment to work collaboratively to improve instruction. The entire staff has also been trained in the use of Calm 
Classroom to support th
e social/emotional needs of our students. Teachers have also received training in the use of 
instructional technology to support our one
-
to
-
one Chrome book initiative and our Innovation Lab.  The efforts of the 
Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support Team (MTSS) e
nsures a collaborative teaching and learning environment that addresses 
the social/emotional, behavioral and academic support for each student. Additionally, the school has implemented 
Positive Behavior Intervention and Support (PBIS). The PBIS team contin
ues to provide the entire staff with PBIS training 
with ongoing school wide implementation for the 2019
-
2020 school year and beyond. Training in Tier I and Tier 2 PBIS 
strategies will continue for the auxilary staff and the parent community.
 
 
Parent involv
ement has contributed significantly to our success. We believe that students, teachers, and parents should 
work closely together in an atmosphere of mutual respect and collaboration. Education is a function of the community, 
the district, and the school. W

 
 

support, the exceptional expertise of our Brywood staff, a
nd our shared commitment to learning, we face this challenge 
with optimism and confidence. Thank you for your continued support and contributions for excellence.

funds which included the creation of new
 
innovative learning spaces, an Innovation Lab, a Design Lab and a brand new 
Activity Center. Our Activity Center houses our Music program and is also used for a variety of instructional needs.  
Brywood has twenty
-
four regular classrooms. Walking through o
ur school, one can see that all areas are utilized for a 
variety of small groups and large group instruction. As part of our commitment to a safe and orderly campus, we have 
developed a comprehensive Student Behavior PLan through PBIS.  An Emergency Disast
er Plan has been developed and 
provides alternatives for a variety of potential disasters. Evacuation drills are conducted regularly throughout the year. 
Our disaster preparedness plan is updated yearly and is on file in the office. We maintain emergency s
upplies such as dried 
food, water, first aid, tarps, space blankets, and other essential disaster supplies in a central location.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administr
ation of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and

funds to school districts.  In 
place of more than 40 specific funding categories, the new model has established three sources of state funding with 
increased local discretion to determine how best to spend those funds in the service of students.  All distr
icts receive a 
BASE of per
-
student funding that varies slightly depending on grade level.  All districts also receive SUPPLEMENTAL 
funding.  IUSD has used BASE and SUPPLEMENTAL funding to support the following programs:
 
 
Site Programs and Services:  1) Sup
port professional learning and teacher coaching through induction program, content 
TOSAs and teacher mentor program , 2) provide summer school and summer athletic programs, 3) Allocating site funding 
and staffing to support student achievement through supp
ort of Professional Learning Communities (PLC) and site PLC 
coaches, 4) Elementary P.E. paraprofessionals, 5) Support for English language learners, 6) Elementary science, music, and 
art programs, 7) Purchase textbooks and instructional materials, 8) Devel
op a technology rich learning environment 
including; Technology matching programs, Technology Maintenance fund and site technology support staff, 9) Maintain 
previously implemented class
-
size reduction, 10) Additional secondary sections to reduce class siz
e, 11) Middle school 
zero period program, 12) Maintain positive behavioral intervention and support program, 13) Maintain site staffing with 
full
-
time assistant principals, 14) 450:1 counseling ratio, support for large elementary schools and elementary cla
ssroom 
aides, 15) Support interventions and supplemental programs impacting English learners, low income and foster youth, 16) 
Continue to build Career
-
Technical Education pathways and blended 0n
-
line learning opportunities for students, 17) 
Develop mental
 
health and wellness programs and hire district and site based staff including support for the Irvine Family 
Resource Center.
 
 
Finally, CONCENTRATION grant funding equal to 50 percent of the base is provided to districts in which English
-
learners, 
low
-
inco
me students and foster youth exceed 55 percent of the total enrollment.  Irvine Unified School District is not 
eligible for concentration funding because its enrollment does not exceed the 55 percent threshold.
