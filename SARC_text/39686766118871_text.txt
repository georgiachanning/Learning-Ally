About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability 
Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the S
ARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see th
e CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Curre
ncy, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes fo
r all students. The law also 
asks districts to rev
eal whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far more meaningful when alo
ng with 

names of the textbooks used 
in our core classes and their dates of publication.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Pri
ority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter

School Safety Plan
 

ures the school facilities 
are in compliance with all
 
federal and state health and safety regulations. Each year a deep cleaning process occurs during the close of school, either 
during the summer or other extended breaks. In the event of a facility plant emergency, the principal notifies appropriate si
te an
d district personnel to 
resolve the emergency and safely secure or evacuate the students, based upon the site and district emergency preparedness pla
ns (REMS). A 
comprehensive School Safety Plan helps to provide a secure, peaceful and clean environment for
 
the school community. The Readiness and Emergency 
Management Plan is revised before the beginning of each school year and reviewed with all staff members. The last revision wa
s completed in August 
2018. Emergency drills are conducted on a regular basis an

during emergencies and natural disasters. The plan is reviewed at the beginning of each school year with staff and students. 
Monthly drills are planned 
and execu
ted to prepare for emergencies. Every effort is made to ensure students are monitored while on campus  throughout the school 
day. Yard 
supervisors, teachers, site administrators and school staff provide supervision for students before and during school. Th
e playground is safe for all 
students. Dolores Huerta School secures all gates at the start of school for the safety of the students. The campus is a clos
ed campus during the school 
day. Students are walked to the main gates by their teachers at the end of
 
the school day. All visitors must sign in at the office and receive proper 
authorization to be on campus, as well as display their passes at all times.
