School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional through proper facilities 
maintenance and campus supervision. Ongoing maintenance and campus improvements ensure facilities remain up to 
date and provide adequate s
pace for students and staff. District maintenance and site custodial staff ensure that the 
repairs necessary to keep the school in good condition are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used by 
school and district staff to communicate non
-
routine maintenance requests. Emergency repairs are given the highest 
priority. Classrooms and other school facilities were modernized in 2011.

All training and curriculum development activities at Carlton Oaks School support the implementation of Common Core 
Content Standards and State curricular frameworks. Teachers annually individually receive between 3 
-
 
5 days of release 
time for professiona
l development at the site and/or district level. All staff are encouraged to attend professional 
workshops and conferences including GLADD, CGI, Restorative Practices, Open Sci
-
Ed, and CPI. Approximately 70% of our 
Staff Development is done on a partial da
y and approximately 30% is a full day of Staff Development. Decisions concerning 
selection of staff development activities are performed by the principal, district administrators, and grade level 
representatives using tools such as teacher input, district 
benchmark results, data analysis, and focus groups to determine 
the areas in which additional teacher training may enhance classroom instruction and increase student achievement 
levels. Carlton Oaks School offers support to new and veteran teachers through
 
peer coaching and mentoring. All staff are 
encouraged to attend professional workshops and conferences. Classified support staff receive job related training from 
department supervisors and district representatives.
