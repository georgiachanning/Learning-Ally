By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Will Rogers Middle School is well
-
maintained and provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. 
Classrooms, bathrooms, and general areas are in good repair and receive basic cleaning on a daily bas
is. Four full time 
custodians perform basic cleaning operations at our school site, and the Lawndale School District Maintenance and 
Grounds Department provides additional services as needed. Detailed cleaning is done during vacation periods. The 
district 
provides maintenance services on a regular schedule and the district maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good condition and working order are completed in a timely manner. Daily reports of 
incidents that require repai
r at the school sites are processed through work orders. A work order process or request for 
repairs is used to track work orders prioritize emergency repairs and ensure efficient service.
 
 
The buildings are well maintained and surrounded by a grassy quad 
area and a large park. The campus has been renovated 
and the technology has been up graded. All classrooms are equipped with internet connectivity.
 
 
A thorough renovation was completed at Rogers Middle School between 2001 and 2004, as part of the District'
s 
modernization program. Throughout the entire modernization process, the students' safety was at the forefront of 
everyone's mind. To address some of these safety concerns, more classrooms and restrooms were added and new routes 
for student ingress and eg
ress were created.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority:
 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Cali
fornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alterna
te achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for 
entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents and community 
members are very supportive of the educational program at our school and play an important 
role in the success of Rogers. Staff members and parents participate on various committees that make decisions regarding 
the priorities and direction of the educatio
nal plan to ensure instructional programs are consistent with student needs. 
Parents are encouraged to participate on one or more of the following committees or organizations:
 

 
Parent
-
Teacher Association (PTA)
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English
-
Language Advi
sory Committee (ELAC)
 
The SSC, consisting of school staff and parents, is a major governing body that meets regularly to address programs and 
components that make up the school, to discuss the effectiveness of programs relative to the goals of the school, 
and to 
act as a communication liaison between the community and school.
 
 
Will Rogers offers access to medical and health information and screening. Along with the committees and organizations 
mentioned above, parents have opportunities to participate in pa
rent education workshops and classes, conferences, 
school events, field trips, student activities, family nights, career days and academic competitions. Our parents are an 
important part of our school community and are always welcome to visit classrooms an
d participate in school activities. 
 
 
We communicate in a variety of ways with parents. We communicate through the use of telephone, text message,email 
and provide notifications through the LESD app with messages about school events and academic informatio
n to help 
parents support student achievement. Additionally, Rogers sends out a monthly newsletter to inform parents of upcoming 
events and provide information on key middle school issues. The Rogers website, rogers.lawndalesd.org., also provides 
on
-
line a
ccess to assignments, activities and teacher websites that provide on
-
line academic support. The LESD APP, allows 
parents to check the grades, attendance, and missing assignments for their student. Parents can also communicate via 
telephone, email, and can
 
visit our counselors and conference with all of their students' teachers.
 
 
We also have an on
-
site social worker and a team of interns to support the social and emotional needs of our students. 
Our school social worker works with the school and provides a series of parent workshops on topics pre
-
selected by 
parents. Additionally,
 

helps with our safe school programs and supports our conflict resolution/peer mediation program. The Optimist Club 
provides us with a unique resource to con
tinue and expand our music program. The Northrop Grumman Corporation is a 
strong community partner helping our Rogers students in many ways. They provide lunch time tutors, career day speakers, 
funding for science and math field trips and hands on activiti
es, as well as academic awards for excellence in Math and 
Science. Our community partners are woven into the tapestry of the culture of Rogers.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a 
disaster. There is a Safe School Plan created by the School 
Safety Committee that meets to address ongoing issues and procedures for emergency response. There are several key 
elements to our safety plan.  Training of all personnel occurs annually and is on
going.  In an effort to be prepared for an 
Emergency, procedures are reviewed with staff and students through practice drills, bulletins and emergency backpacks.  
Rogers has a school
-
wide discipline policy  that is enforced consistently throughout the scho
ol. Rogers has student 
assemblies that review the emergency procedures, discipline guidelines,  and other safety issues relating to school.  
Parents are sent a "Parent, Student, School Compact" and a District Booklet on "Parent and Student Rights and 
Respo
nsibilities" every year.  The school safety committee and district personnel evaluate the plan annually and update 
the plan as needed.
 
 
Rogers Middle School is a closed campus. All visitors are required to sign
-

er 
school, and during lunch administrators and other campus supervisors monitor activity and ensure student safety.  Rogers 
Middle School has two full
-
time campus supervisors and seven part
-
time campus assistants during school hours.   The 
school is well m
aintained and in good repair.  The school property is fenced and gates remain locked during school hours.  
Rogers also has two counselors and one social worker for student support.  Students are also trained in conflict resolution 
and function as peer medi
ators.  A  Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff, School Resource Officer, works with our students 
in a proactive manner to encourage good citizenship and support the rules of the school and community.  Our safety plan 
is reviewed annually.  It specifically ad
dresses disaster procedures, discipline guidelines, reporting child abuse, and 
evacuation procedures.  A copy of the school safety plan is in the office.
 
 
Rogers Middle School is proactive in providing internet safety.  Students and parents sign an Accepta
ble Use Policy to help 
ensure best practices of all technological devices.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff De

The LESD Education Services team in collaboration with the Language Arts Specialists, English Language Instructional 
Resource Teachers, and Principals have designed a comprehensive system for monthly 
professional development.  All 
district professional development occurs on Thursdays after school following an early release day.   Topics are selected 
based on expressed teacher need and identified student deficiencies.  All professional development in th
e LESD focuses 
on meaningful collaboration, developing teacher capacity and the implementation of research based practices to support 
student achievement. The most prominent initiative we are focused on for professional development is deepening student 
lea
rning and critical thinking with purposeful questioning and academic discourse. This school year we have added Social 
Emotional Learning as our Professional Development focus to improve outcomes for students that have experienced 
trauma and how the staff c
an create, facilitate, cultivate, and maintain positive relationships with students.

Teachers receive professional development in structured cycles that afford them the opportunity to learn about a new 
concept, plan for implementation with their colleague
s, practice their learning with students, and then come back with 
their colleagues to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of their instructional implementation of the new skill.
 
 
Feedback about the effectiveness of the professional development is regularl
y collected to assess the effectiveness of the 
program and make changes as needed.  Additionally, site staff members and Educational Services team members regularly 
visit classrooms to determine the level of implementation of the professional development f
ocus.
