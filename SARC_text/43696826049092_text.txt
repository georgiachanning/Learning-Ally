About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional in
formation about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availa
bility of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All instructional materials in the core curriculum in Saratoga Union School District are aligned to the California Content St
andards and Frameworks. SUSD 
adheres to CA Education Code and
 
AB 1246, which gives school districts freedom, decision making, and choice in selecting instructional materials, and 
requires: implementing the California Common Core State Standards; equal access to current curriculum materials; change in th
e adoption cy
cle; local 
school districts can choose their own adoption review process; and classroom teachers will be a major contributor in local ad
option processes.
 
 
SUSD students have access to standards
-
based instructional materials, as per EC Section 60119(c)(1), 
which states that sufficient textbooks or 
instructional materials means, "each pupil, including English Learners, has a standards
-
aligned textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class 
and to take home. This paragraph does not require two se
ts of textbooks or instructional materials for each pupil." This specifically applies to four subject 
areas: reading/language arts, mathematics, science, and history
-
social science.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional through proper facilities mainten
ance and campus supervision. 
Redwood Elementary School's original facilities were built in 
1952; ongoing maintenance and campus improvements ensure facilities remain up to date 
and provide adequate space for students and staff. District maintenance and site custodial staff ensure that the repairs nece
ssary to keep the school in 
good condition ar
e completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used by school and district staff to communicate non
-
routine maintenance 
requests. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Various improvements are needed throughout the year as identified.
 
Annual inspections and tests were completed for the fire alarm/sprinkler/hydrant, 
fire extinguishers, post indicator valve and backflow, elevator and stage lifts, kitchen hoods and fire systems, bathroom har
dware, and preventative 
maintenance on sewers.  
Weed abatement and pest control is monitored and performed.  Every room receives deep cleaning in the summer. Preventative 
maintenance is performed on all HVAC units.
 
 
Every morning before school begins, the day custodian inspects facilities for 
safety hazards or other conditions that need attention prior to students and 
staff entering school grounds. One Day custodian and one evening custodian are assigned to Redwood Middle School. The day cus
todian is responsible 
for general grounds maintenance,
 
cleaning the restrooms, multi
-
purpose room, trash removal, and preparing the school for opening. The evening 
custodian is responsible for cleaning the classrooms and trash removal.
 
 
The principal and Vice Principal communicate with custodial staff daily c
oncerning maintenance and school safety issues.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASP
P] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eig
ht and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant 
cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education

School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive School Site Safety 
Plan (CSSP) was developed for each school in SUSD in collaboration with the School Site Councils, the SUSD 
Emergency Planning Committee, local agencies (sheriff, fire department, and city government), and the district office to fulf
ill Senate Bill 187 
requ
irements. The CSSPs were approved by the district's board of trustees before March 1st.  Components of this plan include info
rmation assessing the 
current status of school crime committed on school campus and at school
-
related functions, strategies and pro
grams that provide or maintain a high 
level of school safety, procedures for complying with existing laws related to school safety, including child abuse reporting
 
procedures, teacher 
notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures
, procedures for safe arrival and departure from school, sexual harassment 
policy, and dress code policy.
 
 
The school's most recent school safety plan was reviewed, updated, and discussed with school staff and the School Site Counci
l at the beginning of th
e 
school year. The most current copy of the school plan is available in the school office for public review. For additional inf
