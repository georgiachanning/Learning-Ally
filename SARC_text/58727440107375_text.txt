About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Californi
a is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agenc
ies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data repor
ted in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/gua
rdians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of

Here at Rio Del Oro, we place a huge emphasis on parent involvement.  We know that parent sup

and emotionally. We welcome parents to volunteer during school events, with classroom projects, and they have the opportunity
 
to volunteer as a 
chaperone on field trips.
 
 
In addition, our PTO (Parent T
eacher Organization) is always looking for parent volunteers!  The PTO sponsors the Annual Harvest Festival, Pastries with 
Parents, Teacher Appreciation Week, and other activities throughout the year. Many of these are community events that familie
s partic
ipate in together. 
The other events are fundraisers and provide extra resources for our students. The proceeds from theses fundraisers go back i
nto the classroom to 
support students and their learning. To get involved with the Rio Del Oro PTO, go to www.fa
