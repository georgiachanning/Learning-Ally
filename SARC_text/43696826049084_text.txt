Principal's Message
 
I
'd like to welcome you to Foothill Elementary School's annual School 
Accountability Report Card. 
In accordance with Proposition 98, every school in California is required to issue an annual School

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains informatio
n about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they in
tend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requireme
nts, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All instructional materials in the core curriculum in Saratoga Union School District are aligned to 
the California Content Standards and Frameworks. SUSD 
adheres to CA Education Code and AB 1246, which gives school districts freedom, decision making, and choice in selecting inst
ructional materials, and 
requires: implementing the California Common Core St
ate Standards; equal access to current curriculum materials; change in the adoption cycle; local 
school districts can choose their own adoption review process; and classroom teachers will be a major contributor in local ad
option processes.
 
 
SUSD students h
ave access to standards
-
based instructional materials, as per EC Section 60119(c)(1), which states that sufficient textbooks or 
instructional materials means, "each pupil, including English Learners, has a standards
-
aligned textbook or instructional materi
als, or both, to use in class 
and to take home. This paragraph does not require two sets of textbooks or instructional materials for each pupil." This spec
ifically applies to four subject 
areas: reading/language arts, mathematics, science, and history
-
soci
al science.
 
 
A Public Hearing for 2018
-
2019 Sufficiency or Insufficiency of Textbooks and Instructional Materials was opened on September 6, 2018 and closed on 
September 27, 2018 as required by Education Code 60119. The purpose of the public hearing is to 
certify the extent to which textbooks and instructional 
materials have been provided to students. The Board of Trustees adopted Resolution 452.9
-
17 which certifies as required by Education Code §60119 (1) 
that textbooks and instructional materials were pro
vided to all students, including English learners, in the district to the extent that each pupil has a 
textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient textbooks and instructiona
l materials were provided to
 
each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with the cycles a
nd content of the curriculum 
frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English/language arts.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional through proper facilities mainten
ance and campus supervision. 
Foothill Elementary School's original facilities were built in
 
1956; ongoing maintenance and campus improvements ensure facilities remain up to date 
and provide adequate space for students and staff. District maintenance and site custodial staff ensure that the repairs nece
ssary to keep the school in 
good condition a
re completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used by school and district staff to communicate non
-
routine maintenance 
requests. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Various improvements are needed throughout the year as identified
. Annual inspections and tests were completed for the fire alarm/sprinkler/hydrant, 
fire extinguishers, post indicator valve and backflow, elevator and stage lifts, kitchen hoods and fire systems, bathroom har
dware, and preventative 
maintenance on sewers. 
 
Weed abatement and pest control are monitored and performed.  Every room receives deep cleaning in the summer. 
Preventative maintenance is performed on all HVAC units. Playgrounds are inspected annually and any necessary repairs are com
pleted and new sand
 
is 
applied.
 
 
Every morning before school begins, the day custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards or other conditions that need at
tention prior to students and 
staff entering school grounds. One Day custodian and one evening custodian are 
assigned to Foothill Elementary School. The day custodian is responsible 
for general grounds maintenance, cleaning the restrooms, multi
-
purpose room, trash removal, and preparing the school for opening. The evening 
custodian is responsible for cleaning the
 
classrooms and trash removal.
 
 
The principal communicates with custodial staff daily concerning maintenance and school safety issues.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the S
tate priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education populat
ion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
alig
ned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that 
satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan (CSSP) was developed for each school in SUSD in collaboration with the School Site 
Councils, the SUSD 
Emergency Planning Committee, local agencies (s
heriff, fire department, and city government), and the district office to fulfill Senate Bill 187 
requirements. The CSSPs were approved by the district's board of trustees before March 1st.  Components of this plan include 
information assessing the 
current
 
status of school crime committed on school campus and at school
-
related functions, strategies, and programs that provide or maintain a high 
level of school safety, procedures for complying with existing laws related to school safety, including child abuse
 
reporting procedures, teacher 
notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe arrival and departure from scho
ol, sexual harassment 
policy, and dress code policy.
 
 
The school's most recent school safety plan wa
s reviewed, updated, and discussed with school staff annually at the beginning of the school year. The 
most current copy of the school plan is available in the school office for public review. For additional information on schoo
l safety programs, policies,
 
procedures, and how you may become involved, please contact the school principal.

trumental in maintaining 
consistency of curriculum design and sharing best practices with one another

professional development, which is more often than not teacher collaboration to focus on professional growth to improve stude
nt learning. Teachers
