About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

by the State are reviewed by all teachers and 
a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommende
d materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adop
tion. The table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the

Supervision is provided to ensure the safety of each student before school, during breaks, at lunch and after school. Supervi
sion is a responsibility shared 
between
 
playground supervisors, parents, teachers, administration and all adults on campus.  If a specific staff person is out or sic
k, alternate coverage 
is available to ensure all students have proper supervision.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan is revised 
annually each year. Results are reviewed immediately with all staff, both certificated and classified. Key elements 
of the plan focus on disaster preparedness and staff response during an emergency. Emergency drills are held on a regular bas
is; fire drills
 
are held once

wide discipline plan is Positive Behavior Interventions and 
Supports (PBI
S) as well as Restorative Practices. Our goal using these particular strategies is to provide students with opportunities to 
learn and minimize 
the distractions that take away from their learning. Staff members are expected to teach expected behaviors and 
use positive reinforcement to promote 
positive behavior on campus. This past year, every teacher used the PBIS team committee school

wide lesson plans to teacher expectations and behavior 
norms to each of their classes. These were expectations that were ta
ught and discussed the first 10 days of the school year.  These expectations are also 
reinforced after holidays and long breaks.
 
 
Parents and students are informed of discipline policies at the beginning of each school year through a Parent/Student/Teache
r
 
Contract, assemblies, 
and newsletters. The table displays the suspensions and expulsions figures for the school and district. Expulsions occur only
 
when required by law or

In the Robla School District, we believe in life
-
long learning, and all staff members in the 
district are given opportunities to continue their learning.  It 
does not matter how long you have been working as a teacher, an administrator, as a bus driver or as a custodian, there are s
till new skills to be learned.  
This is the concept behind profess
ional learning days that take place throughout each school year in the Robla School District.
 
 
Each year, the school schedule includes professional learning days for all staff.  The first professional learning day is sch
eduled on the day before the first 
d
ay of school.  The second day is scheduled at the end of the first trimester of the school year.  The third day is scheduled 
at the end of the second 
trimester of the school year.  Students in the district do not attend school on these days in order to all
ow all staff to participate in learning activities.
 
 
For classified staff, the focus of these learning days is based upon learning needs of each department in the school district
.  Learning for custodians may 
focus on the correct use of new equipment that 
has been purchased for use by the custodian in their cleaning duties.  Learning for kitchen staff may 
focus on the use of new equipment or on healthy meal planning or scratch cooking techniques.  Secretaries may focus their lea
rning on new office 
software 
or on social
-
emotional learning practices for use with students who come to the office.  Each department lead will consider the needs of t
he 
staff, seek input from staff members or may be directed to focus on a specific learning need.  For example, all sta
ff members at all levels are being training 
in appropriate response techniques in an active shooter situation.  A district team was trained in specific techniques by a c
onsulting firm.  The training 
team then conducts training for different department staf
f members on different days during the school year, until all staff members have been trained.
 
 
For certificated staff, teachers, administrators, and specialists, professional learning has focused since the start of the 2
017
-
2018 on specific high impact 
in
structional practices.  The Robla School District in partnership with the Resourcing Excellence in Education (REEd)  Center a
t the University of California 
at Davis, have defined specific guidelines around effective teaching.  These research
-
based practice
s focus on specific teacher behaviors and specific 
student behaviors which increase active learning, language production and higher level thinking in the classroom. Another are
a of focus is 
Social/Emotional Learning which provides specific strategies for e
nsuring schools are calm and students feel safe physically and emotionally.
 
 
Professional Learning Support Teachers (PLSTs) then provide on
-
going support for staff as they take these practices back to their classrooms for 
implementation.  The PLSTs are cla
ssroom teachers who work in pairs.  Each pair, one at first grade, one at fourth grade and one at sixth grade, offer 
support in a variety of ways.  They might come to a classroom and model a specific teaching practice.  They might serve as a 
substitute in 
a classroom to 
allow the teacher to leave and observe another teacher at his/her grade level who has shown exemplary skill with a certain te
aching technique.  They 
might team teach a lesson with a teacher and offer coaching in real time as the lesson is ta
king place.  PLSTs are available to teachers at all grade levels 
and all levels of experience.  A teacher may contact them directly for support with all practices that are the focus of our p
rofessional learning.
 
 
PLSTs and Principals receive on
-
going train
ing in coaching techniques to ensure that they are gaining skill in effective practices for supporting teachers.  
Special coaching training sessions take place throughout the school year.  Specific techniques are discussed and coaches are 
then encouraged t
o put 
them into practice.  Follow
-
up training sessions allow coaches to share their experiences and refine their skills.
 
 
Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) are also at the core of professional learning for all certificated staff.  PLC train
ing was p
rovided to all teachers 
and administrators during the 2017
-
2018 school year.  Our system has been designed to allow teachers to meet in PLC teams throughout the school year.  
Classroom teachers meet in grade level teams at their school on a weekly basis wh
en their students are in enrichment activities with enrichment teachers.

In addition, District
-
wide PLC meetings are held once a trimester where all teachers at a grade level are able to meet together as a PLC focused on
 
the 
needs of that specific grade l
evel.  Principals and PLSTs also support this work as they provide coaching to PLC teams as needed or as requested.
 
 
Additional Professional Learning activities are offered to all staff after the end of the school day.  The focus of these tra
inings is base
d upon the needs of 
staff.  Recent focus areas for teachers include technology in the classroom, social
-
emotional learning, and foundation skills in English Language Arts.  All 
staff members at all levels are also invited to Resilience training, which take
s place throughout the school year after school.  Resilience focuses on the 
relationships we have with the members of the community we serve with a special emphasis on cultural sensitivity.  This work 
is done in consultation 
with the Roberts Family Develop
ment Center and our Resilience consultant, Dr. Sara Truebridge.

English Learner (EL) students receive instruction in English Language Development (ELD) for thirty minutes each day. Classroo
m instruction is supported 
by both Spanish, Russian, and Hmong bilingual assistants. Special needs students are ide
ntified early and appropriate interventions are utilized by 
classroom teachers and school staff. Students who still exhibit difficulties are referred to the Student Study Team for consi
deration, which could include 
special education, counseling, and other 
alternative educational approaches. An intervention specialist and two instructional assistants work with 
identified students in need of academic interventions in math or reading. Glenwood is also in its fifth year in partnership w
ith Reading Partners. Thi
s 
program focuses on one
-
to
-

sessions.  All behavioral and academic supports are offered through the MTSS (Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Su
pport) model where PBIS, Social Emotional 
Learning, and Academic needs are being analyzed and student needs are being met.
