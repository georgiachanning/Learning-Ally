By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Four Creeks Elementary School takes great efforts to ensure a safe, clean, and functional physical environment for 
students, staff, and volunteers. Sufficient 
space is provided for students and staff to support teaching and learning. This 
includes space provided by classrooms, playgrounds, and staff work rooms. To assist our school in this effort, the district 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the S
tate of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of 
this survey are available at the district office. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may b
e 
obtained by speaking with the school principal.
 
 
Maintena
nce and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
give
n the highest priority.
 
 
In 2008
-
2009, a preschool classroom was added to the campus at Four Creeks Elementary School. No other emergency 
facilities needs exist at this school.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
In addition to custodial staff on duty during th
e school day, a team of maintenance specialists come in after hours for daily 
cleaning. District and school maintenance staff work cooperatively with administrators to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Prog
ram
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a 
dollar for dollar basis to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school build
ing 
compon
ents.  Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. The deferred maintenance program ensures that all classrooms and facilities are maintained 
to a degree of ad
equacy that allows for a good learning environment.
 
 
Facilities Improvements
 
During the 2016
-
17 school year, routine maintenance was completed. An additional new portable was added to the school 
due to increase in enrollment.  Also, a new kinder play
-
struc
ture was added to accommodate four full day kindergarten 
classrooms in 2016
-

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parent involvement and 
communication are essential to our school success. Four Creeks Elementary School continually 
strives to involve parents by sharing information that helps parents understand and support school programs and by 
providing opportunities for parent participation
 
in school activities. To increase communication, we send out monthly 
home
-
school connection newsletters  in both English and Spanish. We also send out monthly calendar with the daily  
activities going on during the school day
--
so that parents can come and
 
volunteer.  We also  constantly use the tele
-
parent

There are numerous and varied opportunities for parent involvement, including but not limited to, attending our
 
monthly 
family school functions, participating in parent
-
teacher conferences, volunteering in classrooms, and chaperoning field 
trips. Parents may also serve on advisory committees and leadership teams, including, but not limited to, the English 
Learners 
Advisory Committee (ELAC), School Safety Committee,  Four Creeks School Site Council (FCSSC), Four Creeks 
P.T.A. and our VIP group.  Additional opportunities for parental involvement also exist at the district level such as School 
Smarts and Family Monthly
 
Evening Events.

The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is designed to assist in maintaining a safe school environment
 
and preparing for 
emergencies. The plan requires identification of security needs, development of prevention and intervention techniques, 
evaluation of physical facilities, and communication with staff and students. The safety plan is reviewed annually, u
pdated 
as needed, and fully compliant with federal and state regulations. An updated copy is available to the public at the school 
office.  The school safety plan is discussed annually with staff in August and approved by the Four Creeks School Site 
Counci
l.
 
 

preparedness drills are conducted regularly and the school staff is appropriately trained.
 
 
The school has also taken a stance aga
inst bullying and bullying behaviors and all students have been trained in techniques 
to avoid bullying and to deal with bullying behavior when it is directed towards them.  All reports of bullying are taken 
seriously and reported promptly to parents. Our 
families have access to our emails in order to report bullying on campus.  
There is on
-
going PBIS training in anti
-
bullying on an annual basis at Four Creeks Elementary School. We also have 
information on the website.

Support for Novice Teachers:  Due to a shortage of highly qualified teachers in our area, twenty percent of Visalia 


challenge and in compliance with the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, Visalia Unified offers a robust 
support and 
training system for these novice educators including differentiated professional development and continuous 
professional growth opportunities.  The professional learning system begins with the New Certificated Staff Summer 
Institute which is a five
-
day int
eractive training offered in August one week before school begins.  This training covers 
classroom management, classroom culture, curriculum frameworks, and lesson design. In addition, a four
-
day workshop 
on student engagement and cooperative learning is o
ffered during winter break so that teachers may implement new 
structures and strategies during the spring semester.  All novice teachers receive ongoing support and individualized 
training throughout the year via weekly meetings with their assigned mentor 
at their respective school sites.  Mentors 
and district teachers
-
on
-
assignment support implementation of new knowledge by providing in
-
class coaching, 
collaborating on lesson design, accompanying novice teachers on classroom tours, and assisting with stude
nt data analysis 
to drive instructional decisions.  In addition, novice teachers and their mentors attend monthly after school training in 
action research and are provided time to reflect on their instructional practice.   Mentors and teachers on assignmen
t are 
carefully selected experienced educators trained in how to facilitate the individualized professional growth of novice 
teachers.  Novice teachers who have preliminary credentials participate in the VUSD Teacher Induction Clear Credential 
Program whic
h is accredited by the Commission and is offered at no cost to the candidate.
 
 
Support for Veteran Teachers:  Veteran teachers in need of classroom management assistance also have access to one
-
on
-
one mentor support as may be needed in the case of a new gr
ade level assignment or challenging class.  Visalia Unified 
also offers a Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) program which is a formal system of mentoring and accountability.
