By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Ben Franklin is a one
-
story complex located in a lower
-
middle income area south of San Francisco. The surroundings 
consist of fairly even mix of closely
-
placed, single family houses and apartment co
mplexes. Ben Franklin is a very diverse 
school. It is known for its strong academic standards. We celebrate student learning and success. Currently, thirty
-
four 
classroom teachers provide instruction to an enrollment of approximately 688 students. The supp
ort staff consists of a 
principal, an assistant principal, a dean, two counselors, a resource specialist program teacher, instructional aide, one 
administrative assistant and two custodians. All of our teachers have completed CLAD training enabling them to
 
work 
more effectively with English Learners students. The ethnic composition includes White, African American, Hispanic, 
Filipino, Brazilian, Asian, (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese), Arabic, East Indian and Pacific Islanders. Ben 
Franklin is pr
oud of its diversity and long standing tradition of academic excellence..
 
 
We, the Benjamin Franklin Intermediate School community, are dedicated to educating our students in a positive and safe 
environment to prepare them for success now and in the future
.
 
 
We dedicate ourselves to building students self
-
esteem by rewarding their positive behavior and by respecting and valuing 
individual differences. Students will believe in themselves when they are able to perform tasks and perfect strategies 
which will e
mpower them to become lifelong learners in a technological world.
 
 
We envision a school that empowers students to become productive and responsible members of our richly diverse 
community and to give service to our community. The school, the home, business
, and the community at large will work 
cooperatively for the benefit of our students.
 
 
The SARC is available on the district website at www.jsd.k12.ca.us and can be made available in hard copy upon request.

California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
A full time Assistant Principal, Dean of Academics and three campus supervisors assist the staff in maintaining a safe 
campus for learning.
 
 
Ben Franklin Intermediate Middle School implements a PBIS program to promote a positive school climate.  This inclu
des 
developing SOAR Values which are school wide character assets of safety, ownership, achievement and respect.  A school 
wide online student reward system is used to promote the development of these character assets at all grade levels. 
Inclusively, the 
school implements school wide presentations once per month to identify, define, and develop these 
character assets as well as discussing student issues in these forums.  The school has implemented a Positive School 
Climate Team that coordinates, monitors, 
and implements programs that promote inclusion, safety, building community 
and promoting fair and respectful spaces on campus.
 
 
Ben Franklin has expanded efforts in supporting students in their transition to middle school by implementing a program 
called W
here Everyone Belongs (WEB).  The program supports student peers in assisting incoming students to transition 
to middle school.  8th grade students serve as role models and mentors to 6th grade students as they enter the campus 
in 6th grade Orientation.  6
th graders are assigned a peer WEB Leader who supports their transition throughout the year.  
And, WEB Leaders organize and coordinate monthly activities for 6th graders that promote SOAR Values, and team 
building.  WEB Leaders are recommended for this lea
dership role every year.
 
 
After school sports, intramurals and a wide variety of extra
-
curricular student activities provide a positive outlet for active 
adolescents. Safety is a very high priority at Ben Franklin. Monthly fire drills are conducted as well
 
as earthquake and 
emergency drills. We have also adopted a plan for extreme emergencies, for example: bomb threats and/or code red. We 
also maintain a Safety Plan that contains our philosophy concerning safety and the measures to be taken. There is a dist
rict 
wide Disaster Preparedness Facilitator who oversees the Disaster Preparedness Plan for our district. Our schools is 
identified as a
 
designated shelter by the Red Cross should an emergency occur. There is a detailed site plan of the school. 
There is al
so an ongoing program of chemical substance supervision that is consistent with state law and directed by the 
Director of Maintenance. The district maintains disaster supplies and equipment at our school. The supplies include food 
and water for three days 
for all students and staff, blankets, flashlights, communication devices and other important 
supplies.
