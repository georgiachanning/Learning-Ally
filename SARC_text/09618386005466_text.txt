By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 

 
Buckeye Elementary School, a 2010 California Distinguished School and 2017 STAR Honor Roll School, is home of the 
Bobcats. Built in a wide open oak woodland, our campus is beautiful and 
inviting. For many years Buckeye School was the 
only school in a one
-
school district. Located in Shingle Springs, a rural part of the gold country, our school is rich in history 
and is the heart of our community. Although we are the oldest school in our co
mmunity, we have consistently maintained 
a commitment to innovative instruction and excellence in education.
 
 
Our school is equipped with the latest in educational technology that inspires our staff and engages our students. We are 
particularly proud of a 
full computer lab, internet connected student computers in each classroom, teacher laptop 
computers, document cameras, and Promethean interactive boards in every classroom. Each 3rd
-
5th grade class has a 
Chromebook cart which allows each student to have th
eir own laptop to work on school projects.  In addition there are 
banks of Chromebooks in our K
-
2 classrooms. We have had extensive professional development in the use of technology 
to enhance student learning. All of this adds to an exciting learning and 
teaching environment.
 
 
Our school demographics reflect the rural community that is truly Buckeye. We provide a wide variety of programs that 
support the different needs of our students. Buckeye Elementary receives additional funds through the Title 1 progr
am 
which we put to work for all students to meet or exceed standards.  Bobcat RAP (our signature intervention program) 
provides students with differentiated instruction in the area of reading. We are also able to hire two reading teachers that 
push in to e
ach classroom for part the of the school day to give students additional small group reading opportunities. We 
also have a math intervention teacher to work in our 3rd
-
5th grade classes four days a week to support the current learning 
and give more small g


 
 
Additional enrichment is now becoming a
 
cornerstone of Buckeye. We have an elementary band program that we provide 
before school for interested 4th and 5th graders. We also have a lunchtime STEM Club offered two days a week during 
lunch and recess for students in 2nd
-
5th grade. This year we hav
e added a Robotics Team for some of 4th and 5th grade 
students after school. Our Cross Country team runs in the Fall and competes at a high level against schools across our 
county. This year we've also added a 4th/5th grade girls basketball team and 5th gr
ade boys basketball team. In addition, 
our school participates in Unified Sports which gives our students with special needs an opportunity to participate in 
organized, competitive sports such as soccer and basketball alongside their typical peers who act 
as mentors during 
practice and games.  Finally, we have many lunchtime clubs that have been created by our students including a chess club, 
book club, and computer club.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
T
he percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Buckeye Elementary School 
realizes the positive correlation between parent involvement and student success. For this 
reason, the school continually searches for avenues to involve parents and the community to participate in the education 
of our students. The school greatly benefits
 
from its supportive parents who volunteer, are a part of the Parent Teacher 
Club, participate in fund raising activities, work the Bobcat Bash in the fall and the Ice Cream Social in the spring, and al
so 
serve on the School Site Council.  We have many par
ents volunteering in all classes throughout the week.  Parents who 
are interested in volunteering in their child's classroom must go through the required background check to do so.
