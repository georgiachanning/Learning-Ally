By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Shiloh Elementary School District is a K
-
8 elementary school district located west of Modesto, California that serves 
approximately 180 students. The Shil
oh Elementary School District has one campus on which simultaneously operate both 
an elementary school and charter school. Set in a rural area, the school is the focus of a small community which receives 
tremendous support from parents. The student body is
 
comprised of mostly students of white or Hispanic heritage who 
are served by ten highly qualified teachers. Classrooms are single grade for Kindergarten through 8th grades as all 
combination classrooms were eliminated to commence the 2018
-
2019 school year
.  Individual grades currently average 
around 20 students per class. Our staff is dedicated to providing an enriching, well
-
rounded academic experience. The 
mission of Shiloh School is to maintain clear academic and behavioral expectations with a highly va
lued, consistent focus 
on assessment, intervention, and parent involvement to ensure all students acquire proficiency in grade level standards 
and become respectful, responsible, motivated citizens.  In recent years, the district has focused on the impleme
ntation 
of Mathematics and English Language Arts curricula which are aligned with the most recent state standards.  Currently, 
the district is researching and exploring options for Science and Social Studies programs which teachers are piloting at 
differen
t levels.  Various supplemental academic programs such as Reading Mastery, Accelerated Reader, Imagine 
Learning, MobyMax and Dreambox are also implemented to assist in identified areas of need, both for intervention and 
enrichment.

adoptions with supplemen
tal materials for Science, patience has been a priority with new releases being recently 
approved by the Sate Board of Education.  Time is being invested to research and work with Science specialists at the 
Stanislaus County Office of Education to ensure f
unds are allocated on a comprehensive program which the district can 
support with improved resources.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Summary of Most Recent Site Inspection:
 
The October 2019 site inspection indicated that the Shiloh Charter School facility does not have any major problems.
 
 
Corrective Actions Taken or Planned:
 
The 
Department of General Services approved over $800,000 toward the Shiloh Charter School modernization project 
which took place during the summer of 2008 and helped to repair most issues and bring areas of concern up to current 
codes.
 
The district spent appr
oximately $100,000 funded through the California Clean Energy Jobs Act which upgraded lighting 
and HVAC units campus
-
wide in 2017.  The district has added upgraded fencing and a secured single point of access at the 
front of school and will continue to exp
and the fencing in future years.  The district completes routine maintenance as 
needed.
 
 
School Facility Conditions and Improvements:
 
Shiloh School strives to maintain a safe, positive environment for students, staff, and community. Shiloh School believes 
that an encouraging setting fosters effort and optimism among students and staff. School facilities are always kept in good 
repair, with improvements being funded through our deferred maintenance plan and general fund. In addition, the Office 
of Public Sch
ool Construction approved funds and Shiloh School underwent a modernization project during the summer 
of 2008. This project served to renovate the older school buildings which consist of the administrative office, five 
classrooms, a multi
-
purpose room, two
 
small academic meeting rooms, and the student bathrooms.  The district also 
added modular classrooms in 2017 and 2018 and addressed campus ADA compliance issues at that time.  Apportionment 
from the State Allocation Board for additional construction on th
e District Master Facility Plan is anticipated in the spring 
of 2020.  The plan includes several changes and improvements to the overall safety and security features of the campus.
 
 
Overall Summary:
 
The Shiloh School facility has been deemed to be in good 
repair at the last site inspection.

Californ
ia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate a
chievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parent involvement is a
n essential component in a school district which fosters academic achievement and self
-
esteem. 
Our school district has a Parents Club, a School Site Council, an District English Language Learner Advisory Committee, a 
Safety Committee, and an After School P
rogram Committee in which parents participate. During parent
-
teacher 
conferences, a high percentage (95%) of students had parent/guardian representation at their conferences. Such a high 
level of parental involvement ensures the continued success of Shiloh

meeting, inviting all parents of Title I designated students to attend and ask questions.  The school provides suggestions 
and advice on how to become more actively involved in their children's education.  
In addition, Shiloh School holds an 
Open House in the spring to provide information to the community and to disburse surveys and request input from 
stakeholders to design and implement the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP).  A Public Hearing is sche
duled shortly 
after at a board meeting to again allow for opportunity for feedback on the LCAP before it is approved, published, and 
implemented.  The parent survey is used to identify needs, such as recently noted feedback identifying outside 
supervision,
 
extra
-
curricular enrichment opportunities and more space/facility.  The supervision concern has been 
addressed with the addition of staff; the district had also identified the need for additional facilities to address the othe
r 
areas of feedback and is pr
ojected to begin construction on the Master Facility Plan this spring of 2020 to add 
classrooms/buildings once apportionment has been approved by the State Allocation Board.  Once facilities provide 
additional space, the district plans to pursue opportunit
ies to increase academic and enrichment opportunities for 
students.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The 
administrative, instructional, and support staff strive to establish a school environment that is safe, clean, orderly and 
conducive to academic achievement. Staff members provide supervision for students on campus before school, during 
morning recess, and
 
at lunchtime. Students who break rules are disciplined according to District policy and the California 
Education Code.  An Emergency and Safety Plan as well as a Transportation Safety Plan have been established by the 
District.  The district held an annua
l "safety day" at the beginning of the school year for students and staff to participate 
in a variety of safety drills.  Additionally, Storer Transportation annually conducts a bus evacuation drill and educational 
program conducted by our school bus driver
. Drills for fire safety and lock down security are held regularly at our school.  
School site buildings and playground safety inspections are conducted on an on
-
going basis during the school year by our 
District staff with assistance available from suppor
t agencies coordinated through the Stanislaus County Office of 
Education and the Central Region School Insurance Group (CRSIG).  Over the last several years, the district has prioritized 
maintaining a clean, maintained campus with a specific focus on poten
tial hazards and safety issues and continues to 
ensure school facilities meet state safety codes as addressed with the modular classrooms added in the summers of 2015 
and 2017 which required the school to make updates across the entire campus in order to b
e aligned with new state safety 
codes.  Most recently, new fencing and a security gate were installed during the summer of 2019 to improve perimeter 
security and create a single point of entry for visitors in order to improve monitoring and security as rec
ommended by 
local Sheriff SWAT personnel who conducted a risk assessment with district administration in 2018.  A new up

date 
Comprehensive Safety Plan was last approved in the spring of 2019.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
The Shiloh Elementary School District has established an academic program which is dedicated to providing 
exemplary 
instruction to improve students' academic achievement. In addition to the core program adoptions in English/Language 
Arts, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Science, the Shiloh Charter School District has added multiple supplementary 
programs over
 
the last several years to foster academic achievement for all student groups. An after school program was 
established in 2007 to assist students in core subject areas in addition to providing English Language Intervention (Imagine 
Learning) and tutoring t
o struggling students. A state adopted English Language development program was established to 
provide EL students (as placed through ELPAC testing) into an appropriate group for thirty minutes of specifically designed 
instruction. Also supplemental progra
ms such as Accelerated Reader, Reading Mastery, Imagine Learning, Dreambox and 
MobyMax are used to provide both intervention and enrichment opportunities as determined by benchmark assessments 
and teacher observation.
 
 
Additionally, Shiloh School strives t
o offer an improved education by exploring options in technology and staffing.  In the 
2015
-
2016 and 2017
-
2018 school year, the school added a modular classroom each of these years and hired an additional 
teacher each year to split the 3rd/4th grades and 5
th/6th grades combination classrooms and lower student
-
to
-
teacher 
ratios.   The district continued this process by adding another modular classroom and hiring another teacher in 2018
-
2019 
to split the last combination grades classroom, 7th/8th grades.  Add
itionally the district has hired a part
-
time resource 
specialist who is on campus for two days per week to provide services to students as well as plan scope and sequence of 
lessons.  The school also hired an additional instructional aide to the resource s
pecialist, support general student learning 
and maintain safety outside during recess and lunch due to the gradually increasing number of students.  The district has 
now completed the process of splitting the combination classrooms into single
-
grade classr
ooms and will look forward to 
expanding the growth and opportunities offered by the district as new facilities are added.  Our current classroom teacher
-
to
-
student ratio is 1 to 20.3, a ratio which the district believes is conducive to a supportive educati
onal environment and 
experience for students.

addition to local assessments, state assessments are used to identify areas of need and set professional development 
goals for individual teachers and grade levels.  SBAC testing provided results to help guide future professional 
development.  Teachers and
 
administration meet before the school year begins to discuss overall school results as well as 
individual results to best provide individualized support and instruction.  In 2017
-
2018, ELA scores increased significantly 
(10%+) which outpaced Stanislaus Co
unty, and Math scores increased (8%+) which outpaced both Stanislaus County and 
the State of California results.  Teachers and/or administration meet monthly for professional development purposes, to 
discuss best practices and implementation procedures for
 
state standards and to plan lessons.  Teachers will continue to 
attend professional development opportunities to support their interests and needs.  The district has purchased Studies 
Weekly Social Studies (K
-
6) and teachers continue to attend various pro
fessional development opportunities to support 
the implementation of these programs and improved instructional practices.
