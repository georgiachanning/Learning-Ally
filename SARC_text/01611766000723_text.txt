School Description
 
John G. Mattos Elementary is located in a well
-
established residential area in the Centerville District 
of Fremont in the Glenmoor neighborhood.  As with many neighborhoods, the demographics have 
chang
ed over the years. Although many original home owners still live in the area, others are 
selling, and new, younger families with children are moving in.  Many of our students have come 
to our school by choice from throughout Fremont.  Mattos Elementary Sch
ool is, and has been for 
many years, a welcoming, nurturing community of educators, parents, neighbors, and students.  
Mattos has been home to special programs such as Science Magnet, Special Day, and Inclusion 
Classes.  We are currently the only Californi
a Gold Ribbon Award Science Magnet elementary school 
in the district.  We can serve Fremont students who are interested in participating in a science
-
enriched curriculum.  Most of our instruction is integrated with science.  Every student participates 
in a
 
year
-
long Grade Level Science Project.  Our parent volunteers bring additional Science labs in 
to the classroom through our partnership with Math and Science Nucleus.  We attend an annual 
week
-
long fifth grade Outdoor Science Camp to allow students to exp
erience science in nature.At 
school gardening projects and other classroom and school wide science events occur.  As of the 
2019
-
20 school year, our school serves students in kindergarten through fifth grade, as our sixth 
graders moved to Walters Middle Sc
hool.  This year we have approximately 488 students, and 
about 75 of them are participating Inclusion Classes K
-
2 full time and Integrated Learning Classes 
as well as  Special Day Classes for students with mild to moderate learning disabilities in grades 3
-
5.  Currently, 18 percent of our students have Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), and 
approximately 19.7 percent of our students are English Learners, and this number is growing 
annually.  Eighty percent of our students' parents attended college, a
nd about 14 percent of 
students come from low
-
income families.  Students are offered opportunities to be contributing 
members of the school community through leadership, service, and teamwork.  Students are 
recognized for their achievements and contributio
ns, and they take pride in their school and 
neighboring community.  We sponsor many service
-
learning projects through the year, including 
coin drives and disaster relief efforts.  We have an exceptionally hard working PTA, and they 
contribute to many of ou
r programs, including our Science Docents, Community Coffees, 
Fundraisers, and Festivals.  Our PTA also sponsors community
-
building events throughout the year.
 
 
Students can transfer into the Science Magnet Program using the intra
-
district transfer 
procedure.  
Please visit our web site and our Science News link.  Mattos Elementary is always warm and inviting, 
and we encourage you to visit our school.  We are proud of our school and want to share it with 
you and your family. Our principal Susan Guerre
ro welcomes the entire community to participate 
in our Professional Learning Community. As a Professional Learning Community we have 
collaborated to create the following Mattos Mission and Vision:
 
 
Mattos Mission
 
Our students learn and achieve in a safe, i
nclusive, and positive environment.
 
 
Mattos Vision
 
We will develop a new generation of 21st Century design thinkers, innovative collaborators, and 
effective communicators who actively contribute to society.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educatio
nal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, d
ata reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.c
a.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availabi
lity of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core cla
sses for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal wh
ether those books are presenting what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The first wing of Mattos Elementary opened the Monday after Thanksgiving in 1959.  The school was completed in 1961.  In 1997
, a modular building 
was brought in to house the new library/media center, the science lab,
 
and one additional classroom.  The primary and intermediate playgrounds were 
also replaced that year.  In 2000, improved air
-
conditioning and heating systems were installed.  The restrooms, office, and stage were made 
handicapped
-
accessible.  The front of

added.  The latest improvements and construction is the state of the art two new Science labs as well as two new classrooms i
n 2015.
 
 
Mattos Sch
ool was scheduled for closure several years ago and was not included in the current bond facilities projects.  Like other Fre
mont schools, 
Mattos still has a need for more staff parking and office space.  Our field out back has been reseeded and has a new 
irrigation system.  During the summer 
of 2009, buildings were seismically retrofitted, some dry rot was removed from support beams, specific flooring and roofs wer
e replaced, and restrooms 
and heating, ventilation and air
-
conditioning systems were upgraded
 
to code.  A new fire alarm system was installed throughout the school, which 
includes horns, strobes, and smoke detectors in every room.  A new staff restroom was installed in our far wing.
 
 
Safety is a priority at Mattos and we all work to make our campu
s safe. District maintenance staff helps with the general maintenance and has replaced 
windows and improved outside lighting.  Emergency and safety repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent exp
erts from our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the Facilities 

ions you see on this report.  
Please no
te that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report. Since that time, those conditio
ns may have changed.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co

We have many ways for parents to participate in the life of our school, and we depend on parents to keep our programs running
 
smoothly.  Parents can 
join our School Sit
e Council, which works with the administration to help make financial decisions and monitor our programs and 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement (SPSA). Parents of English Language Learners can join our ELAC or English Language Advisory Committee to collab
orate on improving English 
Language Development instruction and programs.  Room parents organize parent volunteers to help with special projects in the 
classroom and chaperone 
field trips.  The PTA recruits volunteers to help with their many projects and f
und
-
raisers at our school.  We ask all parents to attend Back
-
to
-
School Night 
in the fall and Open House/Science Fair in the spring.  The Science Committee also recruits volunteers for Science Docents, F
amily Science Night, 
Astronomy Night, Technology Clas
ses, and the Career Fair.  New volunteers are always needed and appreciated.  We always encourage parents to be 

or requests.

School Safety Plan
 
Staff and parent volunteers monitor the school grounds for 15 minutes before and after school as well as at all recesses and 
at lunchtime.  Teachers 
regularly review the rules for safe, responsible behavior in school and on the playground.  Visitors must s
ign in at the office, where they receive an orange 
visitor or volunteer badge to wear while on campus.
 
 
The Mattos discipline policy and parking lot drop
-
off/pick
-
up rules are sent home to parents the first day of school.  Periodic reminders are 
reviewed in 
our bi
-
weekly Mattos Messenger.  We also have a Junior Safety Patrol Team, which assists students through our crossing guard and val
et programs.
 
 
We revise our School Safety Plan annually; it was last revised and approved by the Mattos School S
ite Council in March 2019. The plan includes procedures 
for emergencies, exit routes, and inventories of emergency supplies.  We keep copies in the office for parents.  We share the
 
plan with all staff during a 
school wide staff meeting.  We practice fire 
drills monthly and disaster drills four times a year, including two earthquake drills.  The plan also includes 
action plans in the areas of school climate, culture, and physical environment. The Mattos team addresses important issues fo
r health and safety 
that 
include training students and staff regarding diversity, gender issues awareness, and anti
-
bullying.
