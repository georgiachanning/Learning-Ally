The School Accountability Report Card (SARC) was established by Proposition 98, an initiative 
passed by California voters in November 1988. The SARC, which is issued annually by local school 
boards for each public elementary and secondary school in the sta
te, provides parents and other 
interested people with a variety of information about the school, its resources, its successes and 
the areas in which improvements are needed. It is important to note that this document represents 
the 2018
-
19 school year.
 
 
Weldon Elementary School is proud of the differentiated instruction for children that occurs daily 
in all class
-
rooms. A multiyear focus for our professional learning communities (PLCs) has been the 
integration of the effective Social Emotional Learning St
rategies, The Positivity Project, and Positive 
Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) that gives meaning to peaceful classroom practices 
and promotes positive interactions between students and staff. Weldon is maximizing student 
learning time, and ou
r students are reaching new heights.
 
 
Weldon has made the Social Emotional Learning for ALL children a top priority, and has taken steps 
over the past 3 years to better meet the emotional needs of ALL children. Weldon received the 
2005
-
06, 2007
-
08 and 2013
-
14 Title I Academic Achievement Award and also received a 2005
-
06 
and 2007
-
08 honorable mention recipient in the California Distinguished School Program. Weldon 
was also a 2018 Honor Roll recipient of the prestigious Campaign for Business & Education 
Exce
llence (CBEE) award and was selected as a recipient of the 2018 Bonner Center for Character 
Education award through California State University, Fresno!
 
 
I believe you will find that what emerges from this SARC is a picture of a school with a solid 
commitm
ent to our students and community, a faculty that is professionally skilled and personally 
dedicated to meeting the learning needs of our students, and a student body that is constantly 
being challenged to perform well. You may request additional informati
on regarding the SARC by 
calling our school office at (559) 327
-
8300.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
 
Ray Lozano
 
 
Principal
 
 
 
School Mission Statement
 
We, the community of Weldon Elementary School, will create an organized and collaborative 
environment that teaches the stand
ards to children with compassion, care and consistent 
schoolwide expectations, leading to success for all.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information 
about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they inte
nd to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Clovis Unified School District sets a high priority upon ensuring there are sufficient textbooks and materials to support the
 

CUSD Board Policy Number 3301 establishes criteria and procedures 
for the adoption of all textbooks. All K
-
8 textbooks purchased have been approved 
by the State Board of Education and adopted by the Clovis Unified Governing Board. Textbooks and instructional materials purc
hased for grades 9
-
12 are 
aligned to the state co
ntent standards and adopted by the Clovis Unified Governing Board.
 
 
The Department of Supplemental Services continues to support the school sites with funding that allows for the purchase of su
pplementary instructional 
material for our students, including 
English learners in grades K
-
12. The supplemental material is designed to accelerate pupils as rapidly as possible 
toward grade
-
level proficiency in the core subjects of English
-
language arts, math, social science and science. These supplemental materials 
are used in 
addition to the basic reading/language arts and other core materials provided for every student and are correlated to state c
ontent standards.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Weldon Elementary was built on its current location in 1949. We provide a clean, safe learning environment. Weldon is thrille
d to have a newly expanded 
library and computer lab, as well as brand
-
new kindergarten clas
srooms, including a new teacher work center. Our kitchen has just been totally 
modernized to better feed our children. Our custodial staff consists of one daytime custodian and two evening custodians who 
perform basic cleaning 
operations daily and maintain
 
the grounds and buildings. All restrooms have 100 percent of toilets in operating condition. In addition, deep cleaning is 
conducted two times a year at each site. Our SART committee conducts eight clean
-
campus inspections each year.
 
 
This committee of pa
rents inspects the campus grounds and restrooms on a regular basis to provide feed
-
back to our student body. When asked to grade 

 
t


 
 
We are striving to improve student responsibility and community support in keeping our campus safe and clean. Through increas
ed community 
awareness, pride and an open
-
campus policy, we hope to keep vandalism and burglary to an all
-
time low.
 
 
With the use of 21 classrooms and six portables, we comfortably house and provide instruction for our 671 students. Our libra
ry media cente
r (LMC) is 
in continual use. A highly qualified library tech is in charge of maintaining the library and purchasing new materials. The L
MC has a collection of Spanish 
and Hmong books for use by parents and students that reflects our linguistic and cultural
 
diversity. The focus of recent library acquisitions has been to 
supplement the Accelerated Reader (AR) list, and to purchase a web
-
based version of AR to better meet the needs of our students.
 
 
Every student in upper grades, including in the resource spec
ialist program, has been tested to determine their reading range, and AR books in the library 
are clearly labeled with the reading level and point value. AR is linked on the school website, so parents can find books in 

t
he Clovis branch
 
 
of the Fresno County Public Library. Our students use the library for research, recreational reading, computer work and AR re
ading. Each class has weekly 
scheduled access to the library. Our library is open daily to students and parents b
efore and after school, and at morning and lunch recesses. The library 
tech has supplemented the collection with additional books, videos and teacher resources in all academic areas. Most recently
, the library has expanded 
its resources in California missi
ons, habitats and ecology.
 
 
We are committed to providing children with unique access to technology at Weldon. Weldon has purchased Chromebooks and Win
-
Book laptops for 
grades 26, which enables us to be at a 1:1 student
-
computer ratio in nearly all of our 
classrooms! Additional iPads, laptops, computers and software are 
available for our kindergarten and first grade students and are in use throughout the instructional day. Ten interactive comp
uters in our library provide 
access to the electronic catalog, an
d each classroom has computers and iPads that provide access to the electronic catalog. Our entire school now has 
wireless internet access. Every upper
-
grade classroom has computers for use with AR. The LMC provides sets of wireless laptops to classrooms f
or 
students to work on group projects
 
 
in their classrooms. Our ongoing commitment to technology allows for more meaningful educational experiences for our children
 
and improved academic 
performance, and allows our children to compete in our technology
-
dri
ven world.
 
 
The district believes schools are the hub of their neighborhoods. As a result, a high priority is placed on building and main
taining excellent facilities as 
economically as possible.
 
 
In March 2012, voters within the CUSD approved Measure A. Th
is bond measure of $200 million was combined with state bond funds and developer fees 

s to modernize all our aging 
elementary schoo
l sites. Building additions, remodels and site improvements have taken place at all district schools, including Weldon! Weldo
n 
Elementary now has solar panels on site. This installation is part of a districtwide initiative to save $2 million in annual 
ener
gy costs! This savings will go 
right back to our children in the classroom in the form of school supplies!

in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co

Types of Services Funded
 

 
On an annual basis, Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) submits the Application for Funding Consolidated Application and Re
porting System for 
Categorical Aid Programs commonly called CARS. The application is submitted in two (2) parts:  Part I, which con
tains program and demographic 
information, is submitted by June 1 each year; and Part II, which contains the budget information and additional program data
, is submitted by January 
31 each year.  The categorical programs included in the application are Tit
le I, Part A 

 
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged 
Improving, Title I, Part C 

 
Migrant Education, Title II, Part A 

 
Preparing, Training and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals, and Title III 

 
Language Instruction for Limi
ted English Proficient and Immigrant Students.  Essentially, these funds are designed to assist students in mastering state 
standards.
 
 
Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community
.  CUSD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive differences in the lives of the children we all support.  We know from research tha

education will not only bring success to your child but other children 
in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending
 
on the type of categorical 
funding a site may re
ceive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and guidelines.  Such adviso
ry 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee 
(DAC) and School Advisory Committee (SAC)

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each and every s
tudent.  Parental involvement is a necessary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall program.  At the district level, parent committees provide input into each of the 

Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP)

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://
www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
t
s, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.

District Advisory Committ
ee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves as an advisory committee
 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. 
They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs are supplemental education opportunit
ies that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  Th
e SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are 
required to form an ELAC. The ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding ser
vices for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two 
years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall 
be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a D
ELAC representative and arrange to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/gu
ardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) 
currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) elected to serve as the DELAC 

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meet
s four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achievement of our students, comm
unity agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan
 
Native students in grades K 
-

assists eligible students to achieve at the same challenging state performance standards expected of all students in grades p
re

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP a
nnually that works to better align the academic plan with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to 
participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participa
tion of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, District Meetings and 
Community Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share 
their ideas on how CUSD 
ca
n provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in the forums wi


 
 
These forums are designed to provide an opportunit

provide input and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to sha
re new ideas to support 
identifi
ed groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical funding and programs in CUSD.  These funds are further discussed and outlined
 

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 
Gen

ics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economic
ally disadvantaged homes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they have a primary language other than English.  Ch
ildren, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally
 
provided through the base/core curriculum program.  The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Catego
rical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support t
o meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of high quality
 
learning opportunities and access to the core curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additional assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom pro
gram (base/core curriculum) 
and address any learning ga
ps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff development.   Staff developme
nt 
activities are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other staff to 
cha
llenge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
