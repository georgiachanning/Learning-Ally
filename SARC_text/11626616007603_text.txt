Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Despite the 
age, Murdock Elementary prides itself in being a safe, clean, and well
-
kept campus. Two full
-
time custodians 
clean the classrooms and office areas every other day while the restrooms and food service areas are cleaned daily. The 
entire school is monitored 
closely by administrators to report any unforeseen mishaps that may need the immediate 
attention of our custodial staff.
 
 
Murdock Elementary main buildings were built in 1952. Portable Classroom buildings were put in place during 1971, 1985, 
1987, 1992, an
d 2000. The main buildings have been updated several times to include: installing heating and cooling, 
carpeting, and new lighting which has helped to maintain the efficiency and structure of the building. In 2015
-
2016, 
Murdock got a new roof and new paint
. The cafeteria/multi
-
purpose room is available to accommodate our food service 
program and our music program.The school is in good condition despite its age.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team
 
to perform an inspection 
using a survey called the Facilities Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction. Based on 
that survey, we've answered the questions you see on this report. Please note that the information reflect
s the condition 
of our buildings as of the date of the report. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy th
e requirements for entrance to

The California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1, 2018, regarding how to calculate school

pupil expenditures that will be 
reported on 2018

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018

We are required to report financial data from the 201
-
2019 school year by the California Department of Education. More 
recent 
financial data is available on request from the district office. It is important to note when comparing Teacher and 
Administrative Salaries, these salaries include BOSS (Benefits on Salary Schedule).
 
 
Spending per Student
 
To make comparisons possible acros
s schools and districts of varying sizes, we first report our overall spending per student. 
We base our calculations on our average daily attendance (ADA) for the 2018
-
2019 school year.
 
 
We've broken down expenditures by the type of funds used to pay for t
hem. Unrestricted funds can be used for any lawful 
purpose. Restricted funds, however, must be spent for specific purposes set out by legal requirements or the donor. 
Examples include funding for instructional materials, economic impact aid, and teacher an
d principal training funds.
 
 
Next to the figures for the district and state averages, we show the percentage by which the schools spending varies from 
the district and state averages. For example, we calculate the school's variance from the district averag
e using this formula:

The Glenn County Office of Education provides our 
teachers a full day of workshops geared around the Common Core. 
The event is called Common to the Core. Teachers take time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their 
knowledge of the subjects they teach. There are many opportunities for
 
professional development with a site focus on 
Common Core implementation, Explicit Direct Instruction, and Positive Behavior and Intervention Support. Some teachers 
volunteer and participate in professional development grants that enhance instruction in m
athematics and science. Our 
school's professional development focus is on technology, PBIS, and MTSS.
