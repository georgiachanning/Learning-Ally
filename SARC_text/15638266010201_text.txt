By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members 
should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
d
ropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Cal
ifornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with altern
ate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for
 
entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Parent involvement plays a critical role in student success.  At Tompkins Elementary, parents are 
involved extensively in 
classrooms working with students one
-
on
-
one and with small groups.  Parent trainings are held every month.  Topics such 
as tutoring tips, teacher/parent communication, home/school communication, learning styles, and school policies 
are 
discussed.  Our school's Parent Teacher Group (PTG) is very active in providing opportunities for parents and other 
community members to be involved in a wide range of student
-
centered activities, both during and after school.  Our 
School Site Council 
(SSC) and English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), consisting of parents, classified staff, certificated 
staff, and site administration meet a minimum of five times during the school year to discuss, develop, and monitor school 
goals and budget allocatio
ns.  We also hold additional activities such as book fairs, Family Nights, Family Movie Nights and 
assemblies that showcase our students and provide lasting memories.  Parents at Tompkins Elementary know that they 
are always welcome and appreciated.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan outlines all safety procedures to be followed by our 
students.  This document, 
located in the school office, is available for parent review.  It is our goal to provide our students with a safe, orderly an
d 
secure environment that is conducive to learning.  Furthermore, the plan is designed to help staff and 
students save lives, 
protect property and give aid to disaster victims.  To attain these goals, the Comprehensive School Safety Plan makes 
people aware of how to act and react before, during and after a disaster.  The plan is updated yearly by the Tompkins
 
Elementary School Site Council & Safety Committee in collaboration with police and fire officials.  Charts with earthquake 
and fire drill procedures are issued to each staff member, placed in substitute folders, posted in each classroom.  Disaster,
 
fire, 
and/or earthquake drills take place monthly to practice procedures, and routes of evacuation.
 
 
During the school day, our student's safety is addressed by using teachers, instructional aides, and campus supervisors at 
recesses and lunchtime.  School visito
rs who come on campus are required to scan their state or government ID through 
an identification system called Raptor.  Raptor performs instant background checks against certain criminal databases.  
Utilizing the Raptor system will further help to ensure 
the safety of students and staff.

Professional development is designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for administrators and teachers.  
Training opportunities affirm the basic philosophy of education that learning is a lifelong process 
that contributes to the 
well
-
being of the students, teachers, administrators, and community.  Professional development is an essential 
component of effective instruction and student learning.  All training revolves around the identified needs of students a
nd 
adults for the purpose of improving instruction and increasing content knowledge.  Central to all training are student 
achievement data, district focus areas, and state standards.
 
 
Teachers have opportunities throughout the school year to improve instru
ctional practices by attending trainings, 
conferences, and workshops to learn and refine skills designed to improve instructional practices.  On
-
site staff 
development opportunities are aligned with SPSA goals and occur monthly at designated staff meetings
.  The site created 
professional development focused primarily on the introduction, exploration, and implementation of Mathematical 
Practices.  Teachers are supported during implementation through in
-
class coaching from the Learning Director and 
teacher
-
pr
incipal meetings to review student performance data.
