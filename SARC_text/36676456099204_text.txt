California Assessment of Student Performance andProgressThe California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress(CAASPP) System includes the Smarter Balanced SummativeAssessments (SBAC) for students in the general educationpopulation, and the California Alternate Assessments (CAAs) forstudents with the most significant cognitive disabilities.
