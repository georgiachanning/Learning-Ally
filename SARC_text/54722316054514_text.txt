About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Con
ditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our school has adopted a new Safe School Plan that is in place and updated yearly by the School Safety Committee, and distric
t office personnel. It is 
complete with disaster information as well as overall
 
safety information and advice. Evacuation drills are scheduled on a regular basis to ensure that staff 
and students know what to do in an emergency. A School Workplace Safety representative attends monthly meetings and provides 
updates to staff on 
safety 
and health issues. In addition to these programs, adequate supervision is provided before school, during recesses, at lunch, 
and after school, and 
is noted on the school's duty schedules.
 
 
All school district facilities are supportive of teaching and learn
ing. Classrooms are clean and orderly and provide a safe learning environment reflective 
of student work and current curriculum. Our school has a school cafeteria that provides students with a breakfast and lunch p
rogram and is used as a 
multipurpose facil
ity for large
-
scale programs and meetings. The school library provides students with supplemental reading materials and provides 
additional educational resources for students and parents. The school grounds are kept clean and well maintained for student 
pl
ay, recreation and 
athletic activities.
 
 
We take pride in our well
-
maintained buildings and landscaping. The Tulare City School District employs skilled professionals to ensure a safe and clea
n 
environment throughout the school year. Students, staff, and p
arents are committed to keeping our campus clean and litter free.
 
 
The Tulare City School District provides ongoing maintenance, and routine and major repairs for all permanent and portable bu
ildings to guarantee all 
schools in the district are in good wor
king order and condition. Additionally, school restroom facilities for pupils are maintained so they are functional 
and meet local hygiene standards generally applicable to public facilities, including operational toilets and sinks in all re
strooms. The di
strict has 
established a facilities inspection system to ensure that all school buildings meet the standards listed above.
 
 
The school grounds, buildings, and restrooms are kept clean, safe, and regularly maintained. Our school has a morning custodi
an from
 
6:30 A.M. to 3:30 
P.M. and an evening custodian from 12:30 P.M. to 9:00 P.M. Custodians are regularly monitored and evaluated by the building p
rincipal and a director 
of custodians to make sure that all schools are safely maintained and cleaned. In additi
on to the assigned school custodians, the district has a general 
maintenance crew that takes care of the more technical repairs (plumbing, heating, cooling, gas, electrical, carpeting, paint
ing, major repairs, and so on). 
At times, the district will hire a
n independent contractor to handle repairs that may be beyond the scope of the district's resources. Repairs are made on 
an ongoing basis. The district has a work order repair procedure that begins with the school principal referring needed repai
rs that ca
nnot be taken care 
of by the site custodians to the district superintendent. The Principal requests work orders to the department of the Supervi
sor of maintenance and are 
completed on a timely basis. Each school also has a school workplace safety represent
ative that attends ongoing safety meetings. The school district also 
has a Superintendent's Advisory Committee that meets on a regular basis with the district superintendent to discuss questions
 
or concerns.
 
 
Roosevelt School was built in 1947 with remodel
s in 1949, 1987, and 2003. As the size of the school has continued to grow, the kindergarten classes were 
moved to an adjacent facility, the Clinite Center. This facility houses four kindergarten classes, two transitional kindergar
ten, three preschool clas
ses and 
one special day class for students with autism or special needs. This facility was completely remodeled in 2003. It includes 
two offices for the RSP teachers, 
a waiting room, teachers' lounge, adult and student restroom facilities equipped for hand
icapped individuals, a great room that joins all of the classrooms, 
a computer lab, and two playgrounds.

The total square footage for Roosevelt students, including the kindergarten facility, is 47,768 square feet. The main campus 
has a fully 
functional library 
with a computer area for student access to the Internet. The playground area is divided into two areas, one used for athletic
 
competitions such as 
baseball, soccer, football, basketball, or volleyball. The other area houses large climbin
g apparatuses and a smaller grounds area for running and playing. 
Roosevelt students are fortunate to have access to three to five computers in each classroom in the first through fourth grad
es and a computer lab of 
ten computers in the kindergarten comple
x.
 
 
Overall, this site complex is in great condition due to the recent remodel in 2003 and offers both a secure and safe environm
ent for our students to learn 
and grow.

School Safety Plan
 
The administration of Roosevelt Elementary School is committed to creating a safe, orderly, and respectful environment for al
l students. We have 
developed and implemented a Comprehensive School Safety Plan and a Crisis Management Plan, covering all possibl
e disaster scenarios. These plans are 
reviewed and updated annually by school personnel, parents, and community members for effectiveness. Students and staff membe
rs also participate 
in monthly fire drills, periodic earthquake drills, disaster drills, and 
an annual bus evacuation drill. All plans were reviewed in the Spring of 2019, by faculty 
and School Site Council, due to the fact that they were completely re
-
written. They now include specific information concerning terrorism and severe 
disaster plans an
d are continually being updated.
