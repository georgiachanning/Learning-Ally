About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required
 
to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be
 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more inf
ormation about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the scho
ol principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have
 
books in core classes for all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far mor
e meaningful when along with 
the more detailed description of textbooks conta

in our core classes and their dates of publication.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Maxine Hong Kingston was built in August 2006. The adjacent magnet school (Valenzuela)
 
merged with Maxine Hong Kingston School. This campus is a 
Preschool through 8th grade campus, serving approximately 1000 students within our zone boundaries. We are located within Zon
e H, which also serves 
three other local schools within our district.
 
 
M
axine Hong Kingston/Valenzuela School has 4 buildings in Magnet program, three main classroom buildings, a multipurpose room,
 
a music room, a 
library, media center, and an administration building. One Orthopedic
-
ally Handicapped (OH) class housed in the E 
Building. There are no portable 
classrooms or structures on site. There are four main playground areas, and access to the park for field activities.
 
 
In January 2009, a classroom in the C Building was renovated into a licensed preschool room.

the highest priority.
 
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that all classrooms, restrooms, and facilities are 
well
-
maintained and in good 
repair. The principal works regularly with the custodial staff to develop clean
ing schedules to ensure a clean and safe school. During the breaks, custodial 
cleaning plans are scheduled between the Head Custodian and the Principal to ensure site priorities are addressed and maintai
ned.
 
 
A security buzzer was installed in the front of
fice to give access to authorized visitors through the front gate. The Photo

voltaic Project was completed in 
Fall of 2014.
 
 
Stockton Unified takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, we
 
utilize the facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California OPSC. The full report is available upon request.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

the school facilities are in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. Each year, a deep cleaning 
process occurs during the 
summer or other extended breaks. Site Inspection Checklists are completed quarterly by the Head Cust
odian and submitted to Risk Management to 
ensure the physical plant is safe and free from hazards. In the event of a facility plant emergency, the principal notifies a
ppropriate site and district 
personnel to resolve the emergency and safely secure or evac
uate the students, based upon the site and district Readiness and Emergency Management 
for Schools (REMS). A site review with the district Internal Evaluation Instrument (IEI) occurs annually.
 
 
A comprehensive School Safety Plan, which was recently 
reviewed (September 2018)  by school leadership, and it will be reviewed by SSC in Nov. 2019; 

res to follow during 
emergencies and 
natural disasters. Emergency drills (fire drills, secure building drills, and earthquake drills) are conducted on a regular b
asis. In the event 
of an emergency or crisis, School Messenger system and written communication will be used to contact and notify 
our families and community of the 
situation and provide updates as needed.
 
 
Every effort is made to ensure students are monitored while on campus throughout the school day. The School Safety Team is co
mprised of two Campus 
Safety Assistants (CSA), Six Noon
 
Duty Supervisors, Teachers, support staff, and site administrators. Our School Safety Team provides ongoing supervision 
during the school day in the main common areas to ensure the campus is safe and orderly for all students. All visitors must s
