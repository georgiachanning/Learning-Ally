Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The school site council has written and developed a comprehensive safety plan relevant to the needs and resources of 
Howard Gardner Community School 
(Education Code 32281, 32282).  The school site council has consulted with local law 
enforcement in the writing and development of the plan, as well as other school site councils and safety committees, 
when practical.  In addition, the school site council 
has consulted with other local agencies as appropriate, including health 
care and emergency services. The Howard Gardner Community Charter School Governing Board and the school site council 
has delegated the responsibility for writing and developing a scho
ol safety plan to a school safety planning committee.  It 
is also updated on a yearly basis.

The responsibility of monitoring the campus before, during, and after school is shared by Administration, certificated, and 
classified staff. All visitors are 
required to sign in at the office and wear appropriate identification while on campus.  Our 
campus is a "closed campus", therefore students are not allowed off campus during school hours. The components of the 
safety plan address the following:  child abus
e reporting procedures, disaster procedures, discipline policies/procedures, 
discrimination and harassment policy, and school
-
wide dress code policies.  The plan is available to all stakeholders and is 
reviewed with staff members during school
-
wide staff m
eetings, reviewed as necessary throughout the school year.  Fire 
drills are conducted on a monthly basis, in addition to earthquake, lockdown, and active shooter drills throughout the 
school year.  Howard Gardner Community School is committed to the safety
 
and welfare of our students and school 
community.
