Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Knights Ferry School is located on 7.717 acres. The school consists of two main buildings and four portables. One of the 
main buildings was rebuilt in 1974 and has a classroom, multipurpose room, cafeteria, staff room, sma
ll work room, two 
student restrooms, one staff restroom, and storage areas. The other main building was constructed in 1988 and has three 
classrooms, the office, two student restrooms, and one staff restroom. The portables were brought in as early as 1983 
and as recent as 2005. Three of the portables house classrooms. The fourth and oldest portable houses our library. The 
school is in very good condition. The buildings and grounds are cleaned and maintained regularly. Our custodial 
maintenance person works 
daily from 11:00 am
-
6:30 pm. The buildings are in good repair and no structural work is 
required. New tanbark and a complete renovation of the footing on the lower playground was completed in August 2016. 
In July 2017, the upper playground received new foo
ting and tanbark. New lighting was put in all the classrooms through 
the Prop 39 grant funding.
 
 
A complete fire inspection was conducted in the Spring of 2019 and Fall of 2019 by the Stanislaus County Fire Marshall.
 
 
A complete facilities inspection was a
lso conducted by our property and liability insurer CRSIG in June 2019.
 
 
All corrections as requested were made.
 
 
August 2018 a new sink was put in the middle school classroom connecting to the water heater in the cafeteria.The 
classroom was painted and ne
w carpet and tile is scheduled for February 2019.
 
New blinds were placed in all portable classrooms and the MPR in 2018.
 
New drinking fountains were installed in August 2018 replacing old and rusty fountains.
 
New alarms and fire systems were also put in pl
ace in 2018.
 
The portable roofs and gutters received extensive cleaning and repair in December 2018 (2018
-
2019 school year). A brief 
inspection of portables showed they are in good condition structurally though the roofs needed minor maintenance and 
gutter
s needed cleaning.
 
Roof repairs were conducted on the main classroom building in 2019.
 
Repairs to the parking lot lights were made in 2019 and 2020.
 
New flooring was placed in the MPR in 2019 as well as new carpet in the middle school classroom in 2019.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessm
ents for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in t
he administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have
 
successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
