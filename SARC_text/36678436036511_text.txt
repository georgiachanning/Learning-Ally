By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
December 2019
 
 
The California State Board of Education reviews elementary level textbooks and adopts those that meet standards defined 
in the State Frameworks.  Textbooks are selected in the Redlands U
nified School District through a committee of teachers 
and administrators.  They review the materials that have been approved for purchase.  Teachers at each site have an 
opportunity to preview texts prior to selection. Textbooks are selected and purchased
 
on a seven
-
year cycle, rotating by 
content area, as budget permits.
 
 
Copies of student books are available at the Redlands Unified School District Office for parent review.  All programs feature
 
a variety of instructional materials and technology to enhan
ce the instructional program for our students.  Each student 
has available a copy of all necessary textbooks and curriculum materials in the classroom.

The staff, students, and 
parents at Kimberly take pride in the well
-
maintained school facilities and voluntarily participate 
in regular gardening and clean
-
up sessions.  The governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in RUSD. 
A summary of these standards is ava
ilable at the school office, at the District Office, or at www.redlands.k12.ca.us. The 
principal works with the district office and custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
When maintenance and repairs are needed, th
e site custodians are notified or work orders are submitted to the district's 
service center where district personnel are dispatched in a timely manner to make any necessary repairs. The school's 
green spaces are regularly maintained by the district's grou
nds crew.
 
 
Age of School/Buildings: Kimberly was built in 1957 and underwent "modernization" in 2003.  Technology infrastructure 
was upgraded most recently in July, 2018.  The newest playground structure was completed in August, 2018.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., 
California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/
literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California St
ate University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Kimberly Elementary School
 
offers a variety of opportunities for parent involvement. The PTA is highly active and 
supportive, providing opportunities for parents ranging from a few volunteer hours per year to chairing committees and 
being involved on an on
-
going basis.  In the 2019
-
20 school year PTA membership reached more than 400 members.  Each 
year PTA sponsors fundraising projects and uses the proceeds to support student enrichment programs and class field 
trips.  PTA also sponsors several educational assemblies as well as the 
annual Fall Festival, Family STEM Night, Reading 
Month, Family Reading Night, Reflections Art Program, and the annual Spaghetti Dinner. In addition, Kimberly's PTA 
reserves funds or donates towards capital projects, such as enlarging the lunch shade struct
ure.  The students and staff 
are fortunate to have such an active parent organization.
 
 
Kimberly School has other groups for parents to be involved in as well, including School Site Council and the English Learner
 
Advisory Committee (ELAC). Additionally, e
ach month a 'Coffee with the Principal' meeting is open to all parents.  A variety 
of school topics and issues are discussed throughout the year and an opportunity for questions is provided.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Kimberly's School Safety Plan was reviewed with staff at the beginning of the school year with specific focus on procedures 
for fire drills/emergencies, 
earthquake drills/emergencies, and lock
-
down drills/emergencies.  A new school safety 
committee comprised of parents and staff was formed in October, 2018, to identify and address campus safety concerns 
and to facilitate the school's move to a closed campu
s, which was implemented in January, 2019. Information from the 
school safety committee as well as suspension/expulsion reports and staff observations is used to make informed 
decisions regarding school protocols, rules, and consequences to ensure students
 
are physically, socially, and emotionally 
safe at school.
 
 
Campus monitors, teachers, and the principal supervise designated entry points and the school grounds throughout the 
day, including the bus drop
-
off area, cafeteria, and playground. Signs are post
ed to indicate that all visitors must report to 
the administration office and may not be on school grounds unless they have a visitor's pass.  Entry doors to the main 
office were recently re
-
configured to direct all visitors through the office before acces
sing other buildings or areas on 
campus during the instructional day.

Kimberly teachers regularly engage in professional development sessions at the school site and district level.  Each year 
one full day and five partial days are dedicated to
 
professional development on
-
site, at a minimum, on topics such as 
reading, math, writing, classroom management, curriculum, intervention, technology, or data analysis.  In addition, the 
district office provides numerous full day and partial day trainings/
workshops during the school year and during breaks.  
For the 2017
-
18 and 2018
-
19 school years, district
-
sponsored writing training was provided during three partial day 
sessions for all teachers. For the 2018
-
19 and 2019
-
20 school years, two fulll
-
day sess
ions were provided on English learner 
instructional strategies. Occasionally, teachers voluntarily attend professional development off
-
site, such as the CUE 
Conference.  New teachers are supported through the BTSA program and teachers in need of improvemen
t are supported 
through the Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) program. Partial
-
day professional development for classified staff is 
provided by the district office throughout the school year.
 
 
All district and school training is aligned with California Stan
dards for the Teaching Profession, Common Core State 
Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, History
-
Social Science Framework, or other pertinent policies and topics.  
In addition to staff development days mentioned above, weekly after
-
school meeting
s are used to analyze student data, 
collaborate on grade level goals, conduct staff meetings, support professional learning communities, score student writing 
samples, etc.
