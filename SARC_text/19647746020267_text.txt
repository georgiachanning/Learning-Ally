About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every sc
hool in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local 
educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additio
nally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://w
ww.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, 
parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

We choose our textbooks from lists that have already been 
approved by state education officials. For a list of some of the textbooks we use at our school, 
see the Data Almanac that accompanies this report.
 
 
We have also reported additional facts about our textbooks called for by the Williams legislation of 2004. 
This online report shows whether we had a 
textbook for each student in each core course during the 2013

2014 school year and whether those textbooks covered the California Content Standards.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Lugo Elementary was partly remodeled six years ago. A new administration 
building and library was added, as well as a two
-
story building with sixteen 
classrooms. There are thirteen other classrooms in older buildings or portables, which are well maintained. The restrooms and
 
cafeteria are clean and 
functional. All of the classr
ooms have Internet and multiple computers. A new playground structure for students was built and installed on the northwest 
corner of the school grounds in January of 2012. The school cafeteria was repainted during the summer of 2012. Upgrades to th
e schoo
l, to ensure safety 
and functionality, were completed during the 2012 

 
2013 and the 2013 

 
2014 school years.
 
 
Additional repairs and or modifications are being planned for the replacement of flooring systems, playfield irrigation syste
ms and window syste
m repairs 
for the fiscal year 2105
-
2016.
 
 
The District allocates funds for major repairs or replacements of existing school building components. Typically, this includ
es roofing, plumbing, heating 
and air conditioning, electrical systems, interior and exte
rior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the
 
Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects 
of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical systems, heating and ventilation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good
 
repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired
, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for this assessme
nt were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look
 
at the six

Tool used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summat
ive Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may parti
cipate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter

standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

State 
Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each scho
ol site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Parents and the community are always welcome at Lugo Elementary School. Parents are encouraged to attend all parent council m
eetings (English 
Learner Advisory Council (ELAC), School Advi
sory Council (SAC), and School Site Council (SSC). In addition, parents are invited to provide input and receive 
parent education during Coffee with the Principal meetings.  Back to School Night and Open House are great opportunities to m
eet teachers and l
earn 
how parents can support the classroom. Lugo Elementary School annual Title I Meeting is an opportunity for parents to learn a
bout federal requirements 
for school funding. Lugo Elementary also has monthly student assemblies celebrating academic achieve
ment and attendance. The Family Involvement 
Committee prepares special events throughout the school year to encourage active family participation in school.  Parents can
 
volunteer for school 
activities or in the classroom by contacting the front office or 
a representative of the Family Involvement Committee.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Oth

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Lugo Elementary. Administrators and teachers regularly monitor the campu
s. Students are supervised 
at all times, with additional staff overse
eing students before school and during lunch. After school, teachers escort their classes to designated exit gates 
for dismissal. Kindergarten students are released only to their parents or caregivers. The school welcomes parents and commun
ity members to v
isit the 
campus. Anyone wishing to be on school grounds during operating hours must enter through the main office. Parents and communi
ty members typically 
request a visitation prior to arriving at the school. The school principal or another staff usually e
scorts visitors to their desired locations. All visitors must 
sign in at the office and wear identification badges throughout the duration of their stay.
