By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

based textbooks and 
materials are 
available for every student to support instructional programs in the schools. Prior to adoption, the Los 
Alamitos Unified School District conducts a thorough review of its curriculum to ensure that it is aligned with the Californi
a 
Standards for the Common
 
Core. Under California law, the State Board of Education reviews K
-
8 textbooks and other 
instructional materials and then adopts those meeting specific quality standards. In the Los Alamitos Unified School 
District, textbooks considered for adoption are c
arefully reviewed by a committee of teachers and administrators. The 
most promising programs are piloted using established criteria and guidelines. The recommended books are then 
approved by the Los Alamitos Unified School District Board of Education. To r
eceive State instructional funds, the Los 
Alamitos Unified School District ensures that it has fully complied with the requirements of Education Code Section 60119. 
The District has also conducted an annual public hearing ensuring the sufficiency of instru
ctional materials.Each school 
maintains a library/media center which is supported by District and State supplemental funding.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Los Alamitos Unified School District (LAU
SD) has always emphasized the importance of a clean, safe environment for learning. The 
environment of each campus is a matter of pride for students, staff and parents. Several schools have planted individual gard
ens, organized 
workrooms, and planned workd
ays for students and parents to enhance the facility. To insure that our facilities are in good repair condition, 
custodians at each site perform monthly inspections and the District maintenance crew places safety as the number one priorit
y. Hopkinson 
was 
built in 1961.
 
Overall the school is in good condition. It is clean and well maintained. Voters within the District boundaries approved a 
local bond in 2008. Due to the passage of the Measure K Bond in 2008, all school sites within the District were modern
ized. The modernization 
work included the installation of new roofs, electrical, HVAC, plumbing, fire alarm and data systems. The doors, windows and 
flooring were 
replaced along with all new restroom fixtures. The modernization of Hopkinson Elementary Scho
ol was completed in September of 
2012.
 
 
Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by speaking with the school principal.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic
al education sequences or programs 
of study.

Student data is collected via District benchmarks and various formal assessments, such as CAASPP an
d 
Fountas & Pinnel Leveled Reading Assessments, to determine instructional needs for teachers. The District provides annual 
training to ensure accurate calibration in the administration of reading and mathematics assessments in order to assess 
site vs. dis
trict
-

new to the Los Alamitos Unified School District are placed on a five
-

n.
 
 
Teachers are 
placed into cohorts according to the number of years with the District and attend professional development 
sessions.
 
 
Teachers are also released to attend pre
-
approved workshops and conferences with the expectation of 
disseminating their f
indings by way of instructional networking.
 
 
The District also provides content specific training when 
needed by departments or grade level teams. 
 
 
Teachers are supported through on
-
going, in
-
class coaching by District TOSAs.
 
 
Site administrators provide 
regular, 
ongoing feedback by conducting classroom observations, setting individual goals for teachers, and by providing time for 
teachers to collaborate and review data within grade level teams, subject teams and departments.
 
 
Teachers are provided 
opportu
nities to participate in instructional networking where teachers observe other teachers and debrief on the 
instructional strategies employed within the lesson.
