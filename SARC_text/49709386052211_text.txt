By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Brook Haven Middle School is home to Sebastopol Union School Di
strict's fifth through eighth
-
grade students. Brook 
Haven has been an integral part of the local community for over 50 years. The school facilities are the hub for many 
community events and is the quintessential neighborhood school.
 
 
Rigorous academics cou
pled with enrichment programs foster the development of well
-
rounded students at Brook Haven 
Middle School. Fifth graders learn in self
-
contained classrooms with highly qualified teachers. Beyond core academics, 
fifth graders participate in physical educat
ion, STEM enrichment, and either band or choir. The sixth
-
grade curriculum is 
structured in core blocks with English language arts/history and math/science teachers. Sixth graders also participate in 
physical education and can choose between electives such
 
as band, STEM enrichment and woodshop. Seventh and eighth
-
grade students participate in a standard six period, departmentalized middle school program with subject
-
specific 
instructors. Seventh and Eighth
-
grade students can choose from various enrichment o
fferings, including band, choir, video 
production, woodshop, art, leadership, and helping in a classroom as a cross
-

 
 
Brook Haven students are provided opportunities to participate in various extracurricular activities. 
As a member of the 
West County Athletic League, students can join after school athletics teams (basketball, flag football, volleyball & cross
-
country). Additionally, Brook Haven offers many clubs and activities for students, including Student Leadership, R
otary
-
Interact, Garden, Yearbook, Bike and Book Clubs.
 
 
The TOOLBOX Project is a social
-
emotional curriculum adopted by Sebastopol Union School District. The TOOLBOX 
program provides tools for solving problems in the classroom and in social settings. With 
modifications to provide age
-
appropriate social
-
emotional learning skills, TOOLBOX is used at the middle school level in conjunction with restorative 
practices to better handle conflicts and potential disciplinary issues.
 
 
Students are supported through Ad
visory twice a week which allows students the opportunity to participate in academic 
intervention or extension, based on their personal needs or strengths. Students also have the opportunity for before 
school and lunchtime academic support and after
-
school
 
homework help in the Boys & Girls Club. The use of classroom 
aides allows opportunities for small group instruction and differentiation. Brook Haven prides itself on supporting the 
whole child in a diverse and welcoming environment.
 
 
The SUSD Mission:
 
As 
a progressive district that is an integral part of its engaged and diverse community, Sebastopol Union School District 
graduates all of its students as globally
-
minded citizens, critical and creative thinkers, skilled collaborators, and fully
-
engaged learn
ers who achieve academic excellence and are socially and emotionally resilient; we accomplish this with 
inspired teaching of a rigorous and meaningful curriculum in a dynamic learning environment where we support and 
challenge every student in partnership 
with families and community.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
1.  Gym continues to be monitored for evidence of leaking and the source tracked down and repaired as leaks seem to be 
intermittent during heavier
 
rainstorms. Prior sealant & patch repairs are beginning to fail & are being re
-
done as needed.
 
 
The facility grounds needed general cleanup, mowing, and maintenance after a warm summer season. General facility 
grounds maintenance was completed prior to th
e beginning of school.

Restructuring of the district's maintenance department has allowed for a facilities maintenance and repair plan to be 
developed and implemented. Several facilities walk
-
throughs by the maintenance team and district and site administr
ation 
provided the information needed to prioritize the maintenance and repair projects, placing issues that impact health and 
safety at the top of the list. Close examination was given to the doors, walls, floors, ceilings, carpets, windows and workin
g 
ha
rdware. All areas of each classroom were inspected, including the closets and storage areas, ceilings, vents and water 
fountains. We looked for evidence of leaks, discolored walls or ceiling tiles. Ventilation and heating filters were replaced.
 
All the sch
ool bathrooms were inspected, examining the pipes and hardware, walls, windows and floors. The tiled walls 
were sound, as were the partitions and plumbing. The school inspections included the Library,Gym and the storage sheds 
used to house equipment. All o
f the outside facilities were inspected, including perimeter fences, gates and locks. In 
addition, each roof was inspected, swept clean of debris and accumulated branches and leaves, then checked closely for 
cracks and wear.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Brook Haven School's Safety Plan is designed to positively support the health and safety of school employees, students 
and
 
community. The Safety Plan is 
designed to serve as a quick reference manual to help all employees become familiar with 
the
 
proper procedures, telephone numbers and forms to deal with all types of emergencies. The plan is reviewed yearly, and
 
training is provided to all the certificated
 
and classified staff in order to prepare for emergency response to medical
 
emergencies, bomb threats, natural disasters and crisis procedures.
 
 
The School and District provide safety in
-
service opportunities, conduct annual site inspections, review safety
 
suggestions,
 
review hazard reporting, report to School Board annually on the status of repairs, and address compliance issues. Brook 
Haven
 
adheres closely to all State and Federal regulations that relate to student and employee health and safety 
issues.
 
The District utilizes the Parent Square parent communication system to get messages to families ranging from routine
 
information to school emergency closures.
