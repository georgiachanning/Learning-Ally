Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority:
 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Cali
fornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alterna
te achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for 
entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents of Gazelle Elementary School students support 
fundraising events. In the past, this money has been used for the 
purchase of sports uniforms etc. Fundraising events have included a yearly barbecue, dessert social, and other dinners 
etc.
 
 
The rural nature of our small community provides for a unique rel
ationship between the Gazelle Grange and the school. 
The school uses the Grange facility on an annual basis for its competitive athletic program, Christmas Program, graduation, 
etc. The Grange has given student incentives for attendance and scholastic achi
evement.
 
 
Because of the close proximity to College of the Siskiyous the school is able to take advantage of many of the available 
cultural and educational opportunities. Students from Gazelle attend various theatrical performances, enroll available 
camps,
 
attend summer activities.
 
 
Parents are always encouraged and welcomed to volunteer and spend time in the classrooms.

Teachers, Aides, Principal/Superintendent, Administrative staff, and Cafeteria Director take part in Professional 
Development opportunities. Opportunities for Reading, Math, Technology and Behavior 
management are on the schedule 
which is updated regularly.
 
 
Professional development is an intentional process that gives teachers the ability to analyze the effectiveness of what they 
do, reflected in current practices while making adaptations when 
things are not going well in the classroom. Teachers will 
continue to learn and improve, just as students do. Staff members build teaching skills by participating in conferences, 
courses, and workshops throughout the year and then sharing their experiences
 
and knowledge with their colleagues.
