By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Westwood Elementary School staff, parents, and community are dedicated to the intellectual pursuit and social growth 
of all students. 
 
 
 
Through diversified experiences, our students discover their potential, achieve career and/or college readin
ess, and 
succeed in a safe and caring environment. 
 
 
 
Westwood Elementary School, built in 1971, is located in the northern part of the city of San Diego in the community of 
Rancho Bernardo, California. It is one of 26 elementary schools in the Poway Unifi
ed School District. 
 
 

 
825 students represent a rich diversity of cultural, ethnic and linguistic backgrounds residing in a variety of 
homes from apartments to single
-
family dwellings. The neighborhood is a pleasant mix of families and 
retirees. 
Approximately 47 percent of our students are non
-
Anglo, the largest groups being Asian and Hispanic. Approximately one 
hundred
 
fifty of our students speak a language other than English in their homes. These languages include Spanish, Dutch, 
Russi
an, Korean, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Cantonese, Filipino, Portuguese, Thai, Lao, Arabic, German, Hebrew, Hindu, 
Italian, Farsi, French, Polish, Rumanian, Gujarati, Urdu, Punjabi, Serbian, Albanian, and Japanese. 
 
 
 
In the spring of 2006 Westwood completed an 
extensive construction and modernization program as a result of 
Proposition U funding.
 
The school
 
now has a new multi
-
purpose room and student lunch area, an upgraded library facility 
and technology center, 12 new permanent classrooms, 4 learning centers, 
completely refurbished playgrounds, running 
track and grass field, and fully renovated facilities in existence prior to modernization. Recently, Westwood added several 
features such as window tinting, and shades, retrofitted gates, and a visitor check
-
in s
ystem in order to enhance safety 
and security. Through PUSD support and
 
family/community donations, each classroom is equipped with 21st century 
teaching and learning tools such as iPads and Chromebooks, Apple TV,LCD projectors, document cameras, and acces
s to 
a full computer lab and four computer resource areas.
 
 
Westwood
 
Elementary School is a shining example of a school serving a community with diverse needs and interests. 
Boasting a strong tradition of voluntarism, one cannot enter the school without finding
 
many parent and senior volunteers 
assisting in student learnin
g. A spirit of collaboration and innovation pervades the school as teachers and parents work 
together to maximize student learning. 
 
 
Westwood has received recognition for its efforts to provide quality education for all students. In 2001 Westwood was 
hono
red as a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence (the first Blue Ribbon Award was received in 1994) after being 
named a California Distinguished School in 2000. In 1993 it received one of 205 California Distinguished School awards. 
 
 
Westwood was recentl
y recognized once again in 2012 as a California Distinguished School.
 
 
Westwood
 
was
 
recognized by the California Business for Education Foundation and Just for Kids California as a 2007
-
2014
 
Honor Roll School for public schools with high academic achieveme
nt. This
 
recognition validates Westwood's 
continued commitment to narrow the achievement gap.

The entire staff and parent community are involved and committed to providing a learning environment that allows 
each student to achieve these goals. 
 
 
 
The 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement incorporates our core values, as well as the vision, goals, and
 
objectives of 
 
Westwood Elementary School. This provides us with the opportunity to design our instructional program, integrating all 
available resources in a coordinated manner to meet the educational needs of all students. This school wide planning 
proc
ess promotes local ownership of the school program and builds communication and collaboration among all staff 
members and stakeholders. 
 
 
Westwood is truly dedicated to its community and its students. Our active PTA
 
 
membership
 
 
continually provides 
outsta
nding assemblies, after school events, and curriculum enhancements that amaze and inspire our students and entire 
community.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Poway Unified School District ensures that students attend
 
clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each of its schools is maintained in good repair.  A work order 
process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and well maintai
ned.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A night custodial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms and offices daily.  
The district has adopted cleaning standards for all schools.  A summary of these standards is available at 
the district offices.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

2020 Profession development focus is on 
supporting students in owning their learning. 
 
Areas presented to support 
this area of focus include Response to Intervention Strategies, goal setting, learning styles, and Specialized Academic 
Instruction. We continue our focus on Next Generation Science 
Standards, and first best instructional strategies. Teachers 
are also
 
 
receiving specialized training in supporting students with special needs. 
 
 
 
 
 
Teachers are also afforded the opportunity to participate in District and site sponsored professional deve
lopment. These 
workshops are typically
 
presented in a semester or year
-
long series and support a wide variety of professional growth 
areas. They include the implementation of
 
state adopted California State Standards,
 
use of effective instructional 
strategi
es, implementing the use of computer technology in teaching and learning, effective use of assessments, positive 
discipline in
-
services, and multicultural training. Teachers and administrators are actively involved in professional 
development activities at
 
the school and District. The Poway Professional Assistance Program (PPAP) provides support for 
new teachers. Teachers are encouraged to participate in the National Board Certification process and recognized by the 
Poway Unified School District when they
 
a
chieve NBCT status.
 
Additionally, teachers participate in Teacher Learning 
Cooperatives (TLC's), most recently in the area of
 
science and technology.
