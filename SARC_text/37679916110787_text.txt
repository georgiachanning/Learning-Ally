By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
 
The District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the Di
strict 
uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. This survey was 
completed on 05/02/2019 and is available at the Facilities, Maintenance and Operations office.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and
 
the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Facilities Description
 
This school has 22 permanent classrooms and 6 portable classrooms, a library, a multipurpose room, a computer lab, and 
a
n administration building. The main campus was built in 1992. A new kindergarten play structure was recently installed.

Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working or
der are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The school is cleaned every other night by a district cleaning crew. Wo
rk performed includes: sweeping, vacuuming, and 
mopping floors, emptying trash, cleaning sinks, filling dispensers, and dusting rooms, as scheduled. Grounds are 
maintained by District groundskeeping staff. There is one full
-
time day custodian. The day cust
odian is responsible for 
daily restroom cleaning, cleaning eating and food preparation areas, daily grounds clean up, minor facility repairs, and 
special emergency clean ups. Carpets are shampooed and tile flooring is cleaned and refinished every winter, s
pring, and 
summer break. A thorough deep cleaning of all areas is done every summer. District administration works daily with 
custodial and grounds supervisors to ensure a clean, safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The District allocates funds for de
ferred maintenance projects which consist of major repair or replacement of existing 
school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, 
interior or exterior paint, and floor systems.  Thes

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only e

student achievement data, teacher needs 
assessment surveys, and observations of instruction. In response to these priorities, sessions are developed to support 
classroom implementation. Teachers requiring additional certifications to meet student needs are
 
enrolled in appropriate 
programs.
 

 
Certificated and support staff participate in workshops offered within the District (in person and online), offered 
by the San Diego County Office of Education, local universities or outside vendors as appropriate.

students. Site categorical fund expenditures must be approv
