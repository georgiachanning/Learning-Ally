By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Loara Elementary School staff members based their Mission and Vision on the following three beliefs:
 

 
All children can LEARN!
 

 
Every student is an individual.
 

 
Every adult can make a difference for stu
dents.
 
Our mission at Loara School is to teach all students well, enabling them to reach their greatest potential. This statement 
is based on our vision of a school where each student is provided an outstanding education in a safe and supportive 
environmen
t that models, teaches, and promotes self
-
discipline, respect, responsibility, integrity, motivation, critical 
thinking, and learning.
 
 
Students need to be prepared to be global citizens and we support them through both academic 
and enrichment opportunitie

-
STEAMd curriculum 
for all students, and assist students on their journey toward becoming a global citizen, we will continue to provide our 
students access to a full and well
-
rounded c
urriculum, which includes not only English/language arts, mathematics, and 
English language development, but also incorporates rich lessons in social studies, science, physical activity, technology, 
engineering, dual language and visual and/or performing a
rts.
 
 

our goal of academic success and social
-
emotional health for all students. Together with our families, we strive to create 
a 
high
-
achieving learning environment where all students are accepted, challenged, and meet or exceed grade level 
standards as they develop into productive, responsible, respectful, confident, and ethical citizens.
 
 
Students at Loara School were productive a
nd successful throughout the school year in many varied ways. Student growth 
and achievement was evident through the variety of awards students received from their teachers throughout the entire 
year, based on academic gains and good citizenship. Students 
were provided opportunities for involvement in school 
leadership, such as student council. During the school day, students at Loara benefited from enrichment opportunities, 
intervention programs, and differentiated instructional settings. Students were pro
vided enrichment opportunities via 
field trips and assemblies. As a e
-
STEAMd school, all
 
 
students in grades TK
-
4 receive general music instruction weekly, 
while students in 5th and 6th grades participate in instrumental music lessons. We are also known di
strict
-
wide for our 
visual and performing arts activities, with the most notable being an annual musical.
 
    
 
In addition to general education classes, Loara provides students in Special Education Special Day classes with instruction 
that is geared 
toward meeting goals in students' individualized education plans. Loara had three mild
-
moderate special 
education classes with students in these classes coming to Loara from various home schools in the Anaheim Elementary 
School District. Gifted and Talente
d Education (GATE) classes provided academic enrichment for more than 100 students.

rovides intervention to close achievement gaps in support of standards 
mastery. Children, parents, and staff alike look forward with anticipation to even greater growth and achievement in the 
years to come.

Average Percentage of 8 categories evaluated: 99.46% Overall rating: EXEMPLARY
 
 
General: The District takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in
 
this effort, the 
District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. Safety 
inspections take place on a quarterly basis at all sites. Below is more specific information on the condition of 
the school 
and efforts made to ensure that students are provided with a clean, safe, and functioning learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep the school maintained and in 
working order
 
are completed in a timely manner. An electronic work order process is used to ensure timely and efficient 
service. Emergency repairs have highest priority. A maintenance worker is assigned to the site, and is usually on campus 
once every week. No emergenc
y repair needs exist at this site.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule: The District has standard cleaning procedures and guidelines used at each school site. 
Cleaning schedules are developed jointly between the principal and custodial staff to ensure a clean a
nd safe school. Since 

months all schools are being deep cleaned on a rotation schedule.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud

The Loara Parent Teacher 
Association (PTA) contributed time and energy to our school and conducted fundraising in order 
to provide educational activities for our students and families. They also held movie nights to encourage family coming 
together for enjoyable evenings. Parents 
were encouraged to join
 
 
the PTA and/or volunteer their time in support of PTA 
activities. Parents volunteered to assist with a wide variety of activities. A few such activities included assisting teacher
s 
and students in the classroom, becoming a member o
f School Site Council (SSC) and/or attending SSC meetings, and 
assisting with special events such school pictures, and health screenings.
 
 
Parents were encouraged to expand their skills through programs/trainings offered at the school site such as parentin
g 
classes and academically
-
centered trainings. Our annual musical provided further opportunities for parents to become

their children. We were joined by over 300 adult family members at Loara.
 
 
Monthly, we held a "Coffee Chat" meeting which include
d Coffee with Administrators, Coffee with Counselors, or Coffee 
with Cops. In all of these meetings, over coffee and treats, we discussed whatever issues parents contribute. These 
meetings were very informal yet highly informative.
 
 
Additionally,
 
 
du
ring our parent action walks PAWS family members were invited into the classroom where they 

specific grade level classes with administrat
ors, our community liaison, and our curriculum coach, to see instruction and 
learning at every grade level. These events were well
-
attended and enjoyed by family members. Parent volunteer 
Wednesdays were also a success for all.

The vision of AESD is to
 
create an exceptional learning environment that engages, challenges, and supports all students 
so that 
they thrive and achieve their academic potential every year, while preparing them to pursue college and career 
opportunities to become competitive global citizens.

coaching framework and maximize individualized professional learning for teachers through lesson studies, co
-
planning/teaching, PLCs, peer learning walks and provide professio
nal learning.
 
 
Professional Learning areas of focused are identified through analysis of both formative and summative data.
 
 
All 
unduplicated student groups ELA and Math summative data as reported by summative and interim CAASPP test items 
indicate a gap o
f achievement from the standard met indicator.
 
 
To meet these identified students needs the following professional learning has transpired:
