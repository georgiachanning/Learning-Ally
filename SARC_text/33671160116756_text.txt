By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

our 
parents and educational partners, we are committed to academic excellence built upon a foundation of equality and 
personal responsibility.
 
 
Our commitment to high levels of learning requires a balance of academic rigor and sensitivity to nurturing the 
"whole" 
child. Our success is evident daily, as we positively impact all students in academic achievement and socio
-
emotional 
growth.
 
 
Our teachers take pride in their use of current state and school district developed curriculum standards, as well as the 
latest researched
-
based teaching methods in a nurturing classroom environment. Our school utilizes the Professional 
Learning Community (PLC) model, where interdependent grade level teams are provided time to work collaboratively on 
instructional plans to a
ddress the needs of all students. Our focus is on learning with a team approach to improving student 
achievement. Common assessments provide information on what and how our students learn. Through results
-
oriented 
efforts, achievement data is used to deter
mine the instructional delivery of the core curriculum.
 
 
Quail Valley Elementary School provides a safe and welcoming environment for students through the Positive Behavior 
Intervention and Support (PBIS) model. We believe that if we explicitly and systema
tically teach, acknowledge, and expect 
appropriate behaviors, we will be proactive, not reactive, in building a positive, safe, and orderly environment for students
.
 
 
Our Mission
 
 
At Quail Valley Elementary School (QVES), we are committed to providing a st
andards
-
driven curriculum in a safe and 
orderly environment that promotes excellence and values. We believe every child is an individual of great worth, and we 
will equip them with skills and strategies to be life
-
long learners in an ever
-
changing world. O
ur focus is on the four 
essential questions of learning:
 
 
1.
 
What do we want students to learn?
 
2.
 
How do we know if they have learned it?
 
3.
 

 
4.
 
What do we do for the children that already knew it?
 
 
GOAL STATEMENTS
 
 
All 
staff will maximize the potential of all students as they acquire rigorous academic content standards and skills in a safe, 
supportive learning environment.
 
 
All staff will utilize differentiated instructional techniques and multiple assessments to support
 
and demonstrate student 
achievement.
 
 
All staff will support school
-
wide character education to motivate students to become involved and responsible citizens 
who can function in and contribute to our diverse community.

School 
Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Each Menifee Union School site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP), including a disaster preparedness 
plan annually. A copy of the QVE Comprehensive School Safety Plan is available for review at the schoo
l office. The plan 
includes emergency procedures for natural disasters and campus intruders. Students, teachers, and staff are trained to 
prepare for a wide range of emergencies, and frequent drills help to refine emergency skills, policies, and procedures
 
at 
all school sites. Also, following each drill, specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to improve 
emergency procedures continually, and therefore enhance campus safety.
 
 
QVE staff exercises strict adherence to the district adop
ted safety/site security protocols, which include a leveled/colored 

-
in using our Raptor 
system. QVE Comprehensive Safety Plan is reviewed annually; the enti
re staff participates in monthly emergency drills 
and provides feedback.
 
 
Finally, school and district administrators immediately investigate threats of harm. Teachers and administrators seek to 
foster lines of open communication, so students and parents f
eel comfortable reporting inappropriate activity, including 
bullying, harassment, or threats. All QVE staff take a strong stand against threatening behavior or bullying and investigate 
complaint matters thoroughly.
 
 
Our Positive Behavioral Interventions an
d Supports (PBIS) system teaches and reinforces appropriate student behaviors. 
We foster social
-
emotional learning (SEL) skills development in the form of weekly lessons delivered school
-
wide to all 
students, supported by curriculum from SecondStep.org. Th
e curriculum establishes high expectations for achievement 
by all students in every subject area, and students are supported by counseling services that include crisis counseling, peer
 
counseling, and intervention programs.

As a school district, we are focused on increasing academic achievement in English Language Arts and Mathematics along 
with increasing school attendance.   To this end, our professional development strategy is geared to 
increase student 
engagement through the implementation of our district
-
adopted curriculum and the type of interventions we have in 
place.  Site and district leadership teams review achievement data on state and local assessments to make determinations 
on s
taff development and training, to be aligned with yearly goals and projected activities.
 
 
MUSD provides two full days of professional development along with additional days as needed per site and data.  
Additionally, the major areas of focus have been on t
he adopted curriculum and intervention. State and local achievement 
data are used to make determinations. This district provides two full days of professional development along with 
additional days as needed per site and data. Additional days are provided 
before, during, and after school by either 
directors, coordinators, or intervention specialists. Additionally, conferences, workshops, Grade Level PLC, and staff 
meetings are some ways of providing on
-
going professional growth. Many teachers and administra
tors continue to take 
college
-
level courses to enhance their teaching or administrative skills.
