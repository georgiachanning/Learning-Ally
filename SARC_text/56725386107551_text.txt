School Description
 
Christa McAuliffe Elementary School is located near the Seabridge Marina of Oxnard, California. 
Named after the American hero, Christa McAuliffe, the school opened in 1980 and has thrived, ever 
since, as one of the top
-
performing schools in the Oxnard Scho
ol District. During the 2019
-
2020 
school year, Christa McAuliffe will serve a diverse population of nearly 735 students including GATE, 
general and special education scholars in Transitional Kindergarten through grade five. We are 
proud to integrate a Scie
nce
-
Technology
-
Engineering
-
Arts & Math Education or STEAM
-
based 
approach, with an emphasis on Science. We will continue to highlight student collaboration and 
projects throughout the year in these areas. Student work is showcased at hands
-
on STEAM night(s)
 
where the community is invited to come and experience how scholars are learning in these new 
and different ways.  We also offer different options to extend learning before and after school such 
as academic support, our on
-
site ASES After School Program an
d McAuliffe teachers who offer 
varied intervention and enrichment support throughout the year.
 
 
Each classroom in our McAuliffe supports 21st
-
century learning and is outfitted with
 
a Promethean 
Board, Apple TV, document camera, and wifi.  We house a large indoor cafeteria with fresh salad 
bar options daily for staff and students. We also have a full
-
service library that unites Accelerated 
Reader books and myON on the iPads for a tru
ly differentiated, interest
-
based, and goal
-
driven 
reading experience for every scholar. Kids can visit the library before school and at lunch recess at 
two different times of the week to select books of their choice with help from our experienced 
libraria
n. Last year we updated our computer lab; there are 40 PC Dell personal computers, a 
Promethean Board, Apple TV, an HP InkJet Printer, wifi and Califone headsets complete with 
microphone capabilities for our staff and students to complete research, prepare
 
reports, 
presentations and other technology tools to help ensure our scholars are career and college ready 
in the age of the common core.  In addition to our classrooms and computer lab, as in all schools in 
OSD, every child checks out an Apple iPad for t
he academic year at McAuliffe. The opportunity to 
be 1:1 with an iPad allows the students to use all of the online features of their new curricula, 
complete assessments, research, projects, and classwork and more online. Students have access to 
more than 1
0,000 books through the myON app, they can work on their individualized reading goals 
on the Lexia CORE5 app, and so much more! Our goal is that our scholars use the iPad daily as a 
tool to enhance their ability to communicate, collaborate, think criticall
y and gain 21st
-
century 
knowledge.
 
 
To support students' social and emotional growth, we offer a school
-
wide Positive Behavioral 
Intervention Supports Committee and Plan. Our goal at McAuliffe is to provide a safe and nurturing 
environment where every chil
d feels comfortable and can learn and reach their academic, social 
and emotional goals every day. PBIS provides the opportunity for all staff, students, and 
administration to work positively and collaboratively to accomplish these goals. To assist, we have
 
implemented C.H.A.M.P.S. in our classrooms, common areas and after
-
school program. It is a 
comprehensive and consistent approach to managing student behavior in a respectful, proactive 
and supportive way throughout the school.  McAuliffe Elementary is a s
chool where every student 
and staff can say "We Belong."

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every scho
ol in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local ed
ucational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additiona
lly, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www
.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
com
munity members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi

Opportunities for Parental
 
Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Parent involvement is a key element for continued academic success at McAuliffe School.  Teachers regularly communicate with 
parents by phone, with 
written notes, in person and through various activities on the site.  At 
the beginning and throughout the school year, parents are welcomed to McAuliffe 
School through a variety of general parent meetings, principal meetings, parent nights, and individual parent meetings/progra
ms.  Parents are advised 
of school announcements th
rough bi
-
weekly parent updates, the school website, Twitter App, OSD App and ConnectEd phone calls (a mass email, text, 
and message system, in development).  Teachers use standard
-
based progress reports and assessment data at parent/teacher conferences to 
inform 

nts in an academic setting.  
Our Outreach Consultant (ORC) provides parenting classes, which are offered in both English and
 
Spanish to further encourage participation and support 
positive interaction with their children.  We will continue to offer the Parent workshops designed to teach parents how to su
pport their children in the 
area of reading.  Parent Information Nights are
 
held throughout the year to assist in the transition of kindergartners and 5th graders into their new school 
settings.
 
 
We also have parents and community members participate in School Site Council (SSC), English Learner Advisory Community (ELAC
), Parent/
Teacher 
Association (PTA) and as classroom volunteers.  We maintain our connection with the community utilizing our Outreach Consulta
nt to engage and 
encourage open communication with parents and Staff.  McAuliffe School has forged numerous partnerships wi
th local businesses throughout the 
community including, but not limited to: The City of Oxnard, Oxnard Police Department,  Ventura County Behavior Health, Ventu
ra County Health and 
Oxnard Recreational Department.
