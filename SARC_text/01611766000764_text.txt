School Description
 
O.N. Hirsch Elementary School prides itself in being "A Caring Community Working Together ." Our 
mission is to promote a school culture in which parents/guardians and staff work together to 
promote the
 
development of the social, emotional, physical, and academic excellence of all 
students. Our school goals are to provide a rigorous and challenging curriculum based on the 
California State Standards, ensuring high levels of learning for all students; to p
rovide a safe, 
positive learning environment; and to help students become independent, self motivated, and 
enthusiastic learners.  At the core of our mission is to see the student as an individual. By working 
together to provide a program of full inclusion
, which ensures that all students have access to the 
core curriculum, academic support programs, and enrichment programs, we will accomplish our 
goals.  Through our Character Education Program and our schoolwide behavior plan, students learn 
the important 
role they play in their own education, how to make good choices based on important 
values and the importance of positive peer relationships. They remember to show BARK
-
 
Be on 
task, Act Responsibly, Respectful, and Keep Safe.
 
 
Part of making Hirsch a 
wonderful and caring school is our diversity.   We have students of many 
different ethnic backgrounds who speak many different languages.  To ensure clear communication 
with all parents/guardians, we utilize the services of our district translators and our
 
staff members 
who speak a variety of languages.  Students come to us from diverse social and economic 
backgrounds and learning abilities. Together we strive for excellence as measured against 
standards and the student's own individual potential.  The fina
l components of our integrated 
network are our support services. Every student is given the support necessary to achieve 
excellence. We are especially pleased with our Academic Learning Center, our Resource and Speech 
program, and our before and after scho
ol intervention classes. Extra

We are proud of all the hard work teachers, parents/guardians and students put in 
to prepare for 
the future.  It is by continually analyzing available data and examining and reevaluating our best 
practices that Hirsch will continue to be a high performing school meeting the needs of all our 
students.  We are a community of learners who 
believe that given equitable access to the 
curriculum and utilizing research based strategies for learning, all students will be successful not 
just today but in the future in whatever college or career path they choose to take.  It is because of 
this that
 
we were one of the 780 schools in the state of California who are recipients of the 
California Distinguished School Award for 2017

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
dist
rict office.

The main fact abo
ut textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core classes for all stud
ents. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Hirsch Elementary School opened in 1964 with three buildings, an administrative office, a kindergarten classroom, a library s
urrounded by classrooms, 
and a multiuse building surrounded by classrooms.  In 1990, two mo
dular classrooms were added, along with another two in 1992.  In 1998, another 
modular was added. Hirsch Elementary measures 33,022 square feet.  During the summer of 2009, our roof was replaced, new wind
ows installed, 
restrooms upgraded, and our staff roo
m received a new tile floor and paint.  In 2010, our new drive
-
through lot and parking lot was installed which makes 
drop
-
off and pick
-
up safer for students.  In 2011, new playground equipment was installed which adds color and excitement to our school.  N
ew solar 
panels were installed during the summer of 2011 and we became the first all solar
-
powered school is Fremont.  Hirsch is looking beautiful!
 
 
We have one day and one night custodian who keep our facilities clean.  Each classroom is cleaned every oth
er day, and the restrooms are cleaned every 
day. The district gardening crew tends to Hirsch School once every three months and is on call, as is the district maintenanc
e crew. Comments are 
frequently made about our clean, cheerful campus! At our October 2
019 Make a Difference Day, positive messages were added to our front poles to 
greet students and families each morning.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a surve
y called the Facilities 

ons you see on this report. 
Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of 
the date of the report. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the Californi
a Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate ac
hievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for en

California and the California State University, or career technical

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil 
expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Safety is our highest priority. Teachers monitor the school grounds for 15 minutes before and after school as well as at all 
recesses. At lunchtime, trained 
noon superv
isors monitor the lunchroom and the playground. Teachers and the principal regularly review the rules for safe, responsible b
ehavior in 
school and on the playground. We have a closed campus that is fully fenced. Visitors must enter the school through the m
ain door and sign in at the 
office, where they receive a badge to wear throughout their visit.
 
 
We revise our School Safety Plan annually; it was last revised and adopted on April 1, 2019. The plan includes procedures for
 
emergencies, exit routes, 
and inve
ntories of emergency supplies. We make the plan available for our School Site Council and Safety Committee, keep copies in th
e office for 
parents/guardians, and have it available on our website. We share the plan with all staff during a school wide staff m
eeting. We practice fire drills monthly 
and earthquake/disaster drills four times a year. We hold trainings for staff on emergency preparedness at various times in t
he year.
 
 
We have volunteers and teachers to help traffic move smoothly and safely in 
the valet area in front of the school.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. 
 
Below is the amoun
t of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
2017
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations these d
ays are sometimes reduced.
