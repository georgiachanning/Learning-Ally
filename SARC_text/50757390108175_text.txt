School Description
 
Our 
school is a beautifully designed campus. It is named after Sandra Tovar Medeiros who was a 
former teacher in the Turlock Unified School District. She was born on September 5, 1959 and died 
on August 1, 1998 following a battle with cancer. She loved reading
 
and providing books for 
children. Medeiros is designed to be a community
-
oriented campus where families enjoy 
recreational activities after school hours and on the weekends. Our multipurpose room is used 
extensively for a variety of community functions du
ring the evenings and weekends.
 
 
Medeiros Elementary operates on a traditional education calendar with an enrollment of 830 
students. Our current student population includes: White
-
45.1 Hispanic
-
38.7%;  Our Significant 
Subgroups include 0.8% Foster ,14.9% 
English Learners, 46.1% Socio
-
economically Disadvantaged, 
and 12.2% students in special education.
 
 
Medeiros teachers continue to seek more effective ways to differentiate their curriculum and 
provide appropriate academic support for each individual child.
 
At our monthly faculty, leadership, 
and Professional Learning Community meetings, teachers regularly discuss summative and 
formative assessment data, develop common formative assessments to measure student work, 
and plan intervention rotations to better m
eet the learning needs of all students. Teachers also 
enlist the support of our district Instructional Coaches to observe lessons and provide feedback on 
how to improve their lesson delivery.
 
 
We also maintain a close working relationship with our 
local University, California State University, 
Stanislaus. We have tutors, mentors, and observers come into our classrooms to provide support. 
We host a number of student teachers each year in our TK
-
6 classrooms. In addition, university 
classes are taught
 
on campus with the students then providing reading support to our Medeiros 
children.
 
 

accomplishments. Our monthly Star Assemblies highlight students for a variety of person
al 
strengths based on the character traits found in our district Character Traits such as focus and 
empathy. We also honor two Rotary Club students of the month throughout the year at our Friday 


with a StarBuc$ ticket. When students receive three of the tickets they get to pick a prize from our 
Star Store. All students in grades 1
-
6 receive music instruction each week and our fifth and sixth 
grade students are enc
ouraged to participate in our choir, band, and orchestra music programs. 
Students are involved in groups and activities including Student Council (fifth and sixth grades). A 
before and after school PLAY program, operated by the City of Turlock Recreation D
epartment, is 
available to all children and is located in our multipurpose room. The program provides help for 
students with homework, activities, and a safe place for students to stay after school.
 
 
We have a dedicated and caring group of parents and volu
nteers. These wonderful people give 
countless hours of time in classrooms and attend School Site Council and PTA functions. The PTA 
supports teachers and programs throughout the school year. They host different fundraisers 
throughout the year and put on a 
whole school fall carnival, all of these are aimed at raising funds 


 
 
The mission of Sandra Tovar Medeiros 
Elementary School: All Medeiros Stars will excel 
academically and socially in collaboration with families and the community. Our No Bully Motto: 
Medeiros Stars are Respectful and Kind!

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is requi
red by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs)
 
are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an 
LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.
