Elementary School District. Based on the Montessori method, students at RCM are offered a rich 
curriculum that truly values the indiv

Redwood Coast Montessori classrooms provide a carefully prepared environment that is filled with 
beautiful, long lasting materials that are engaging, age appropriate and pedagogically designed as 
self

c
orrecting learning tools. Students spend long uninterrupted academic time following their 
own passion as they work their way through the curriculum. The curriculum is integrated 
throughout all grade levels and all subject matter in such a way that it allow
s for mastery of 
concepts at an individual pace that is appropriate for each child.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School
 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Con
trol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data r
eported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: 
Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
RCM appreciates and relies on its parent volunteers. We are a community of people working together to develop a unique and in
spiring learning 
environment for our children. A volunteer form goes o
ut to the parent community at the beginning of the year asking for information about special skills, 
interests, and availability. It is very important that all RCM parents help support and enhance the school through some volun
teer activity. 
 
 
All enrolled 
RCM families are encouraged to contribute 30 hours of volunteer service to the school for the development of the school and i
ts academic 
goals. 
 
 
A variety of service opportunities exist and include the following: 
 

 
Working in the classroom with our Montess
ori staff
 

 
Development of LCAP and school policies
 

 
Developing classroom materials / special unit studies
 

 
Providing office help
 

 
Chaperoning field trips
 

 
Organizing or working at fundraising events
 

 
Serving on school committees
 

 
Site maintenance/improvements
 
 
Vol
unteer hours can be completed at the school or at home. Parent education nights, fundraising, school events, and parent workd
ays provide enough 
additional opportunities to assure a comfortable level of participation. RCM is grateful for the contribution vo
lunteers make on behalf of the school and 
to the lives of all of our students.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
