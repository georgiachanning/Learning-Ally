Principal's Message
 
 
We 
are very proud to announce that we have made incremental growth in English Language Arts 
and Mathematics on the California state test (SBAC 2019). Our growth signifies our journey on the 
path of continuous improvement. Teachers, students, parents, and I ar
e excited to begin and 
continue the school year with such great momentum of success!
 
 
As we continue our mission of getting our students to become college and career ready, we are 
focusing on student data to make decisions in lesson design, strategies, and
 
shared best practices 
.Teachers continue to hold collaborative discussions during grade level planning, guided planning 
and data reflections. During classroom observations, I will be monitoring and evaluating instruction 
to ensure that we are committed to
 
providing the best education to all our students in a safe, caring, 
nurturing environment.
 
 
This school year, we will continue our focus on the Growth Mindset. A person or student with a 
growth mindset embrace challenges, give their best effort, learn fro
m feedback, become inspired 

Twain, we focus on the process of effort. Students are reminded to never give up and always do 
their best. In relation to the Di
strict Common Assessment, our 1st
-
6th grade students create goals 
which creates a plan and vision for their success. Students are reminded that our brain acts like a 
muscle
-
the more we use it, the stronger and smarter our brain becomes.
 
 
We must prepare ou
r students with the technological skills relevant to the 21st century. This school 
year, we are excited for the addition of two additional chromebook carts. We are proud to be the 
elementary school with meeting the goal of student to chromebook ratio of 1:
1. In terms of 
instruction, teachers are integrating technology in their lessons and classroom activities. Students 
are using Edge,Kahoot, Newsela, Spelling City, and other programs to support our students 
instructional needs. Our teachers are receiving co
ntinuous professional development in using 
technology to augment and supplement their lesson delivery and reinforcement of key 
skills/concepts.
 
 
In terms of the California Common Core Standards, it is our goal to achieve incremental growth 
over the upcomin
g District Unit assessments. Beginning with the Unit 1 District Benchmark test, 
parents receive a progress report. Please keep in mind that this is one indicator of out student's 
overall academic progress.
 
 
During Back to School Night, parents will be prov
ided the opportunity to visit the classroom and 

procedures for the new school year. 
 
 
During parent conferences, parents will have the opportunity to speak with the

regarding academic and socio
-
emotional learning.
 
 
Parent conference are a great opportunity to discuss and develops short/long term goals to 
improve and augment our student;s academic success. As a suggestion, we invite parents to come 
p
repared with written questions and concerns to address the needs of their child. Research shows 
that parent involvement is vital to student;s academic success.

About the SARC
 
By F
ebruary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control F
unding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
sta
te and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the
 
school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The facilities at Mark Twain were first built in 1950 with the newer 
buildings constructed in 2006. The custodial staff and maintenance department work 
together to ensure that the grounds are well maintained and kept clean, safe and functioning properly for students, staff and
 
parents. The restrooms are 
clean and in good wo
rking order with major renovations being installed thanks to Measure K in 2012
-
13. Solar power  structures were built  on site, new 
campus drop off area will be completed by February 2016,  flooring replacements are scheduled for classrooms as well as the 
multipurpose area in the 
summer of 2016 as well as installing new fencing around the campus.
 
 
The district allocates funds for major repairs or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this include
s roofing, plumbing, heating 
and air 
conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting and floor systems.
 
 
In 2006, two new buildings were added to our campus which now house second through sixth grade students. Each building holds 
two large restrooms 
added to the three restroom
s that were built in 1950.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the
 
Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our 
buildings: their structural integrity, electrical systems, heating and ventilation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good
 
repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this 
assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for this assessment were
 
written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the

Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Mark Twain Elementary. Administrators and teachers regularly monitor the
 
campus both within and 
outside the fenced areas. Students are supervised at all times, with additional staff overseeing safety dur
ing lunch, breaks, before and after school. 
Kindergarten students are released only to their parents or caregivers.
 
 
The school welcomes parents and community members to visit the campus. Anyone wishing to be on school grounds during operatin
g hours 
must notify 
the school front office ahead of time. All visitors must sign in at the office and wear identification badges throughout the 
duration of their stay.
 
 
The school safety plan is revised every spring by the School Site Council: revisions are share
d immediately with all members of the staff. Students are 
made aware of the safety plan during school assemblies. The key elements outlined within the plan include: 1) child abuse rep
orting procedures; 2) 
teacher notification of dangerous pupils procedures
; 3) disaster response procedures; 4) procedures for safe entrance and exit from school; 5) sexual 
harassment policy: 6) suspension and expulsion policies; 7) dress code; 8) discipline policies. The plan underwent its last r
evision in March 2019. The next 
revision will be completed by March 2020. The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to haz
ardous materials and state 

aff safety during disaster. Fire and disaster drills 
are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year.
 
 
In preparation for an emergency, each classroom has a earthquake preparedness kit.
