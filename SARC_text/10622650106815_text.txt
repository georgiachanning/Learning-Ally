About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district expends great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the 
district uses a facility survey 
instrument developed by the State of Califor
nia Office of Public School Construction. The results of this survey are available at the KCUSD Business Office.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are provided w
ith a clean, safe
, and 
functional learning environment. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by spe
aking with the school 
principal.
 
 
T. L. Reed School has 27 classrooms, a gymnasium/cafeteria, a library and an administration
 
building. The main campus was built in 2004.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
The Director of Maintenance, Custodial Supervisor, and the site principals work cooperatively with the custodial staff to dev
elop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
The district pa
rticipates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar for dollar basis
 
to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, th
is includes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
In the fall of 2019, Solar panels were installed in west parking and over a portion of the playground area.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare

Parent involvement and communication are essential to our school success. T.L. Reed Elementary School continually strives to 
involve parents by 
exchanging information that helps parents understand and support school p
rograms and by providing opportunities for parent participation in school 
activities.
 
 
There are numerous and varied opportunities for parent involvement. Parents attend school functions and parent visitation day
s, participate in parent
-
teacher conferences
, volunteer in classrooms, accompany their child on field trips, and assist with bi
-
annual book fairs and fundraisers.  Parents may also 
serve on advisory committees and leadership teams, including the Parent Teacher Club (PTC), English Learners Advisory C
ouncil (ELAC), and School Site 
Council (SSC).
 
 
TL Reed will host Parent Institute for Quality Education, PIQE, for the 2019
-
20 school year.  This program will target our 5th through 8th grade parents.
 
 
Home and school communication is enhanced through week
ly notices, monthly newsletters, parent/teacher conferences, the student/parent handbook, 
the school website, student report cards,
 
 
School Messenger telephone messages, the marquee, Peachjar, and other regular communication activities. 
Parent communicatio
n is routinely translated into Spanish.
