About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is req
uired by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEA
s) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in a
n LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should
 
contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the f
ollowing information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan was 
developed for Palm Avenue Middle School in collaboration with local agencies and the district office to fulfill 
Senate Bill 187 requirements. Components of this plan include child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dange
rous pupil procedur
es, 
disaster response procedures, procedures for safe arrival and departure from school, sexual harassment policy, dress code pol
icy, and bullying prevention 
policy. Regularly throughout the year, the school safety plan is reviewed, updated, and shared wit
h school staff as needed and as a component of regular 
staff meetings.
 
 
Campus culture promotes a secure learning environment that encourages mutual respect, safe and healthy relationships, dignity
, and equality. Bullying 
and harassment are not tolerated. 
The district has employed policies, staff training programs, procedures, and practices to reduce and eliminate bullying 
and harassment as well as the means to address such incidents when they occur. Students and their parents receive information
 
annually r
egarding 
district policies concerning anti
-
bullying and harassment.
 
 
All staff share in the supervision of students throughout the day. As students enter the campus each morning, during lunch, a
nd at dismissal, supervision 
is shared by school administrator
s, campus monitors, and assigned teachers. Each individual is either circulating throughout the campus, supervising 
entrances, or monitoring designated areas in an effort to maintain a secure and orderly environment. All parents and visitors
 
are required t
o check
-
in at 
the main office upon arrival, obtain and wear a visitor's badge during their visit, and then return to the main office upon d
eparture.
