Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP) addresses all components of SB 187. The Site Safety Committee, staff, and Board 
of Directors review t

in teaching behavioral expectations.

Harvest Ridge teachers utilize a variety of instructional strategies, including flexible grouping, modeling, guided practice,
 
cooperative learning, and independent practice to address the needs of learners of various 
levels and modalities. 
Instructional Aides provide instructional support for most classrooms, working with small groups of students or providing 
one
-
to
-
one support.  Specialized Support Teachers, including intervention and special education, provide target
ed support 
and instruction at the next level, on a one
-
on
-
one basis or in small groups. Student Intervention Teams (SIT's) convene if 
a series of progressive interventions and scaffolded instruction do not yield appropriate, measurable student progress.
 
 
H
arvest Ridge recognizes its legal responsibility to ensure that no qualified person with a disability shall, on the basis of 
disability, be excluded from participation, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under 
any progra
m of the school. Any student, who has an objectively identified disability which substantially limits a major life 
activity including but not limited to learning, is eligible for accommodation by Harvest Ridge. The school shall be 
responsible for complete 
implementation of an Individual Education Plan (IEP). The individualized education plans for 
students with disabilities will reflect appropriate core academic skills, life
-
long learning skills, and social and interpersonal 
skill objectives developed in com
pliance with applicable state and federal laws.
 
 
Harvest Ridge also provides enrichment opportunities for students in the areas of art and music, Spanish, physical 
education, and STEM enrichment.
