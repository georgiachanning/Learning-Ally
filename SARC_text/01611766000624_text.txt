About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card
 
(SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Pla
n (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For 
more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF 
web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislat
ion calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core classes for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most 
recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Glenmoor was originally built in 1956.  During the summer of 2009, Glenmoor went through an extensive roof inspection, result
ing in repairs and the 
resealing of all buildings, as well as new roofs on the kindergarten
 
wing and the office building.  In the summer of 2006, the sprinkler system was rebuilt, 
and the grass was reseeded.  Additional parking was installed and a new traffic flow system was initiated.  Glenmoor was seis
mically upgraded in the 
summer of 2004.  A
t that time, all the restrooms were completely refurbished, air
-
conditioning was added to areas that did not already have it, and 
asbestos was removed from the office. Glenmoor has five portable classrooms and one portable science lab, which are all in go
o
d condition.
 
 
Glenmoor has one day custodian and one and a half night custodians who keep our facilities clean.  Each classroom is cleaned 
every other day, and the 
restrooms are cleaned every day.  District crews remove graffiti and maintain landscaping on
 
a regular schedule.  We call district maintenance 
immediately when problems such as plumbing occur.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facili
ties 

ions you see on this report. 
Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the re
port. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the Californi
a Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate ac
hievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Glenm
oor has many ways for parents to participate in our school, and we encourage parents to help keep our programs running smooth
ly. Parents are 
present on a regular basis in classrooms to help teachers with learning centers, to tutor students, and to teach ar
t and music. Parents can join our School 
Site Council (SSC), which works with administration and staff to help make financial decisions. Parents of English Learners a
re vital to our English Language 
Advisory Committee (ELAC) and to our outreach efforts on 
behalf of new families, while GATE parents are important to us to ensure we meet the needs 
of advanced learners. Room parents organize parent volunteers to help with special projects in the classroom and chaperone on
 
field trips. Parents help 
organize and 
run a book fair, which help provide more books for the library. The PTA sponsors an annual Fun Run, which provides thousands 
of dollars 
in support of afterschool sports, musical theater, campus beautification, classroom art and music instruction, Glenmoor 
U our after school enrichment 
program, and classroom teachers and the school. We ask all parents to attend Back

to
-
School Night in the fall, Open House in the spring, and parent

teacher conferences in November. We encourage our parents to "be there" for th
eir students on campus and at home.  Parents are encouraged to 
contact teachers whenever they have a concern about their child. We always need new volunteers! If you would like to help out

School Safety Plan
 
Staff and parent volunteers monitor the school cros
swalks and grounds for 15 minutes before and after school. All recesses and lunchtime are supervised 
by staff and/or parents. Teachers regularly review the rules for safe, responsible behavior in school and on the playground.
 
 
The Safety Committee met on S
eptember 24, 2019 to review the plan. We then updated the needed changes with our staff on October 4, 2019.
 
 
Before entering campus, all visitors must sign in at the office and receive a visitor badge.
 
 

annually. It includes the required Comprehensive Safety Plan as well as disaster procedures for emergencies 
and plans to help students learn appropriate behavior. The emergency plan is available in the office for parents and is appro
ved by the School Site 
Council. 
We share the plan with all staff during a school wide staff meeting. Teachers review the plan with students at the beginning 
of each year and as needed 
throughout the school year.
 
 
Each year the PTA inventories classroom and school 
emergency supplies that are in classrooms and the disaster cargo container as appropriate. Glenmoor 
holds all required monthly fire, disaster, and earthquake drills.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. 
 
Below is the am
ount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
2017
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations thes
e days are sometimes reduced.
