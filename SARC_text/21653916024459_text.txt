By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Park School is a K
-
5 elementary school located in Mill Valley, California. It is one of six schools in the Mill Valley School 
District, which is comprised of five elementary schools and one middle school. Park is located in the Sycamore Park 
nei
ghborhood, across from Boyle Park and a few blocks east of the Old Mill. The school was originally named the Mt. 
Tamalpais Park School. It is one of the oldest schools in Mill Valley, opening its doors in 1909. Park has been serving 
children and families o
f Milll Valley for over 100 years.
 
 
Park has a thriving parent community that helps bring enrichment and arts to Park School. With support from the PTA and 
KIddo!, Park School offers children a high quality educational program. Students participate in many
 
special curriculum 
projects such as Math Night, Poetry Caf√©, Character Day, Colonial Fair and a school
-
wide Ocean Study. Classroom teachers 
work closely with our specialists to integrate art, music, dance, technology and poetry throughout our program. In 
addition, the school is proud of its strong focus on character education, mindfulness, the partnership between Zero Waste 
Marin and our Student Green Team, and our many community service projects.
 
 
Park Elementary School provides a comprehensive curriculum
 
that promotes academic excellence and social emotional 
development for all of its students. Teachers assess student
-
learning needs and then develop plans to move these students 
into proficiency in all academic and social emotional areas. Park teachers cre
ate classroom environments in which learning 
is student
-
centered, giving students maximum opportunities for academic conversations with their peers. Lessons have 
open
-
ended responses in order to differentiate learning and meet the students at their educati
onal levels. The entire staff 
works closely together to differentiate instruction and build assessable scaffolds to address areas of need and extend 
learning. Student
-
centered learning structures and a focus on academic conversations provide students with 
support, 
encouragement, and challenges that inspire all to become better students and individuals.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents, community members, and local businesses support local schools through a parcel assessment and contributions 
to Kiddo!, which raises funds to augment a broad range of school programs, including visual and performing arts, music, 
Spanish, technology
 
and global studies. The Parent Teacher Association (PTA) and site leadership provide many 
opportunities for parent participation. Parents and community members are encouraged to volunteer and participate in 
their child's classroom. Additionally, the Park 
PTA organizes the Parkade Festival in the fall, Family Game Night, the Variety 
Show, Ocean's Month, Game Night, Movie Night, Book Fair, Parent Education Nights, the Art Show and promotion 
activities for our 5th graders. The PTA works with the Mill Valley P
arks and Recreation Department to provide optional 
before and after school programs for interested students. After school programs include classes such as Tae

Do, 
art, science, engineering with legos, yoga, beading, ceramics, drawing, and after school
 
play. The PTA supports Artists in 
Residence for drama, poetry, visual arts, martial arts, and dance. All grade levels participate. They also support Art in 
Action (grades K

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Park School. The school is always in compliance with all laws, rules, 
and regulations pertaining to safety standards. The school has a Comprehensive School Safety Plan that includes strategies 
and progra
ms to address a) child abuse reporting procedures; b) disaster procedures; c) policies regarding actions leading 
to suspension and/or expulsion; d) procedures to notify teachers of dangerous pupils; e) sexual and gender
-
based 
harassment policies; f) school
-
wide dress code; g) procedures for safe ingress and egress of pupils; h) rules and procedures 
on school discipline; i) bullying and harassment policies; j) suicide prevention measures; k) school counseling; and l) schoo
l 
resource officer.  The plan is rev
iewed and updated by the School Site Council annually.
 
 


ess plan includes steps for ensuring 
student and staff safety during a disaster. Emergency drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year.
 
 
Discipline & Climate for Learning
 
The Park School Community works together to provide a safe, ca
ring environment where uniqueness and differences are 
respected and all children are supported to reach their full potential. Staff and parents alike are committed to a tradition 
of academic excellence and social skill development. In addition, students ha
ve access to a school counselor as well as 
their teachers with regard to matters of personal safety on campus. We expect our staff and students to be safe, be kind, 
be respectful and be responsible.
 
 
Parents provide strong support to all aspects of the school program and play an integral part in the education of the 
children. They are active partners who contribute time and expertise to the school in order to support classroom programs 
and special even
ts. A high percentage of families volunteer their time in one or more school projects. The PTA's motto is 
"What's Your One Thing?" This is in reference to volunteerism for the classroom and the school.
 
 
We provide our students with a secure, caring, and ch
allenging environment along with the knowledge, skills, and love of 
learning necessary for them to become successful adults. The district's "Kinder Than Necessary" motto is alive and well at 
Park School.
