School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Principal's Message:
 
 
Winfield Elementary School opened in 200
7
-
08 with more than 70% of our students having a first language other than 
English. We presently serve approximately 475 TK
-
5th graders and 48 preschool students; the facilities are expandable to 
handle 800 students. All Winfield Elementary students move o
n to Winton Middle School for grades 6th
-
8th and then to 
Atwater High School.
 
 
We believe every child can learn about themselves and the world around them in order to be prepared to make a 
contribution to society. Not only do we serve a diverse population,
 
but we also have a majority of families that are at or 
below the poverty level. 
 
 
It is our purpose to help each child develop socially, emotionally, spiritually, psychologically, and academically. We have 
been able to maintain the positions of Literacy C
oach and Math/Technology Coach. TK
-
1st grade classes all have 3 hour 
classroom aides. Our TK 
-
 
5th grade classes all have Chrome Books available for each student as well as stand alone 
computers and/or ipads for the students to use. We take great pride in 
the fact that our students participate in extra
-
curricular activities such as the County Spelling Bee, County Speech Festival, County Writing Festival, Junior Olympics, and 
Farm2U. Students are also able to attend field trips each year. In the past, they h
ave attended performances at the Gallo 
Arts Theater, UC Merced, area high schools, and the Merced Symphony. Study trips have led our students to the Monterey 
Bay Aquarium, Hilmar Cheese Factory, Fresno Zoo, Yosemite, Mariposa Mining and Mineral Museum, Col
umbia, 
Underground Gardens, Pumpkin Patches, and much more. Winfield students have also participated in Love Winton, the 
Winton Spring Parade, Christmas Tree Lighting, and Trunk or Treat. We have Award Assemblies to reward students for 
outstanding academic
 
achievements and behavior along with rewards and incentives for SBAC Assessments, ELPAC 
Achievement, Accelerated Reader Achievement, and Attendance. Winfield students also have access to several academic 
programs such as Response to Intervention, non
-
curr
icular software programs, as well as the digital components of our 
ELA and Math Adoptions. An after
-
school program is available for students in grade 2nd
-
5th. The program is staffed by 
certificated and classified employees. Students in the after
-
school pro
gram experience enrichment in the areas of physical 
education, technology, homework assistance, art, yearbook, drama, and language arts/reading support. There are 
currently over 100 students in the program and our waiting list is lengthy.
 
 
Parental involve
ment has grown these past years and and we have dedicated and loyal parent volunteers. Our goal is to 
increase parental involvement each year. We offer parent meetings including preschool parent meetings. Parent input on 
guest speakers and topics is highly
 
encouraged. The support we obtain from our families and community is wonderful.
 
 
We look forward to continuing our partnership with the community and families to accomplish the best education for 
each and every child.

Students can only enter through a gate at the front of the school or the gate  at the side of the school where the yard is 
or the office where there are two secretaries. On r
ainy mornings, the students enter through the cafeteria front doors.  
The front gate is locked during school hours, allowing visitors to enter only through the office.
 
 
After school, the students are dismissed through the front or side gates with teachers 
stationed at the gates and parking 
lot areas. The gates are then locked when the students are gone. Otherwise, from the outside, the  campus is either gated 
or has chain
-
link fencing around its perimeter. Some gates have crash bars on the inside, so it is 
always possible to get out 
but not in.

through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We offer numerous ways for 
parents to partner with us in accomplishing the very best for their child. Some of these

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Student Safety is a high 
priority at Winfield. The  district Safety Plan is reviewed with the staff yearly during the first quarter 
of the school year.  The plan was last updated March 13, 2017 and will be in effect until 2022.  If new Board policies are 
adopted, those are shared 
with the staff immediately following the Board meeting.
 
 
The Safety plan includes specific plans for lockdowns, fires, earthquakes, and other major catastrophes.  Fire drills are hel
d 
monthly, with debriefing afterwards.  Winfield School, along with Winton
 
School District, is working in collaboration with 
the Merced Sheriff's Department to better prepare for a lockdown situation. There are pre and post meetings including 
debriefing with all staff. Winfield is a "closed campus". Visitors are required to regi
ster at the office before going onto 
campus.  Each visitor signs in and is issued a visitor's tag, which is to be worn in plain sight while on campus.  Visitors a
lso 
must sign out when leaving.

site training, individual mentoring, TIP,
 
teacher coaching, webinars, and conferences are examples of some 
of the types of professional development opportunities that are offered. Student assessment data and behavior 
documentation/tracking is used to determine areas that professional development 
will strengthen.
 
 
All staff are encouraged to attend off campus workshops and conferences for which they feel would be beneficial to their 
position and their professional growth.
