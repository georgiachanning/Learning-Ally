School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents are an extremely important part of California Virtual Academy @ Sonoma (CAVA @ Sonoma). Parents will help us 

, parents of CAVA @ 

Some parents will also serve as mentors to new families and families that are struggling with technology complications
 
or 
curriculum problems. The mentors support and encourage families in learning to navigate the day
-
to
-
day management of 
home education. Parents are given an opportunity to make their voices heard (both online and offline) and provide their 
opinions on the
 
direction of the school. Some parents will be asked to give critiques and/or testimonials about the 
program. 
 
 

by researching our pr
ogram and choosing to enroll their child in our school. Parents attend a registration conference and 
agree to the enrollment requirements. By completing these steps, parents show they are committed to being an active 
member of their student's education tea
m in our program.
 
 
Parental involvement is enhanced by the fact that the school will be educating not only students, but also its parents. 
Parents will be trained on the K12 instructional system, and taught how to be effective instructional coaches under t
he 
guidance of highly qualified and certificated teachers. Many parents will learn how to use computers for the first time, 
become expert e
-
mail and Internet users and will be exposed to a content
-
rich curriculum, including classic literature, a 
comprehens
ive re
-
telling of the story of history, various musical genres, and great works of art. Parents will have a rich 
social networking experience with the school Facebook site. We have many resources available both online and offline. 
There are ongoing Parent/
Learning Coach training opportunities through K12 Speaker Series, Online School tutorials, 
School Effectively at Home workshops and staff presented Learning Coach workshops. We have a very detailed Parent 
Student handbook, Special Education handbook and CA
VA @ Sonoma New Parent Resource Guide. The Parent Mentor 
program provides the ultimate one
-
on
-
one experience for Learning Coaches who would like a mentor to support them in 
their journey.

Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The California Virtual Academy at Sonoma takes staff and student health and safety very seriously. Because the school will 
be a virtual school, there will be no need for a school building where classes are held on a 
daily basis. The administrative 
office currently complies with all ADA, OSHA, and local health and safety requirements. The school has obtained all 
necessary permits for these offices including a building and fire marshal inspection and/or a certificate of
 
occupancy.
 
 
Immunization forms and other pertinent medical records will be kept (confidentially) on file by the school administration. 
Parents are expected to ensure that their children obtain proper immunizations prior to matriculating pursuant to Chapte
r 
1 (commencing with §120325) of Part 2 of Division 105 of the Health and Safety Code. The school may exempt students 
from enrolling who are not properly immunized pursuant to §48216 (a
-
c) of the Education Code. Those parents who are 
having difficulty obta
ining immunizations for their children will be provided information on where to get immunized in 
their community.
 
 
All pertinent and required health and safety documentation is collected at time of hire or enrollment as appropriate. 
Documentation is on fil

of employee records and student records can be made available at the request of the School District.
 
 
The school has drafted health and safety procedures 
that the school will follow to ensure the health and safety of pupils 
shall which include compliance with the criminal background check requirements described in Sections 44237 and 45125.1 
of the Education Code.

After reviewing the CA State Dashboard achievement data, high quality instruction, especially focused in mathematics, is 
the major area of professional development for CAVA @ Sonoma staff. All 
teachers participate in beginning of year 
professional development day, monthly professional development meetings, monthly meetings with their Instructional 
Coach, and a teacher collaboration day each semester. A significant amount of time in August before
 
students return is 
allotted for training and review. The primary focus of professional development is on quality instruction in an online settin
g 
to ensure teachers are implementing standards
-
based lessons, making lessons relevant and interesting, involvi
ng students 
in practice, checking for understanding and assessing mastery in real time. Professional development also continues to 
focus on teaching at deeper levels of knowledge to further critical thinking. Professional development is delivered through 
r
ecorded trainings, in person meetings, and online meetings.
 
 
In addition to training, we have implemented a comprehensive instructional coaching program. Every teacher is assigned 
an instructional coach who observes them at least one time each month. Coach
es and teachers meet following the 
observed session in a 'grow' session during which goals are set and progress is discussed. The combination of our 
professional development program and instructional coaching allows teachers to learn instructional strategi
es in a broad 
setting and tailor to their ability and experience for continued growth. Teachers also meet monthly with their regional 
lead for a data conference and review student progress on specific master standards.
