About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Student safety and campus security during the school day are of primary importance. Perimeter gates are kept locked during th

visitor
s must sign
-

ot actively 
monitored, are installed in each engress and egress area. Teachers, instructional aides, and administrators
 
provide supervision before and after school, 
during lunch and during recess periods. Development of the Comprehensive Safe School Plan is a collaborative effort between s
chool and district to 
comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The plan provides
 
students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment.
 
 
Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 within their safe school plans: current status of school crime; chi
ld abuse reporting procedures; 
disaster procedure
s, routine and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual harassment policy; p
rovision 
of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and school employees including tactical informati
on; safe and orderly school 
environment; school rules and procedures; hate crimes polices and procedures; and bully prevention polices and procedures. Th
e school evaluates the 
plan annually and updates it as needed. The plan was last updated and reviewed w
ith school staff in Fall 2019.
