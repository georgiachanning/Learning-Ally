By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
 
The District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the Di
strict 
uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. This survey was 
completed on 09/05/2019 and is available at the Facilities, Maintenance and Operations office.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and
 
the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Facilities Description
 
This school has 18 permanent classrooms and 20 portable classrooms, a library, a multipurpose room, and an 
administratio
n building. The main campus was built in 1954, and a new administration building was built in 1988. The 
school was modernized in 1996. The library, restrooms, and work room were modernized in 2005. Three portable 
classrooms were added in 2017. Plans are un
derway to install a new two story classroom building.

Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used
 
to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The school is cleaned every other night by a district cleaning crew. Work performed includes: sweeping, vacuuming, and 
mopping floors, em
ptying trash, cleaning sinks, filling dispensers, and dusting rooms, as scheduled. Grounds are 
maintained by District groundskeeping staff. There is one full
-
time day custodian. The day custodian is responsible for 
daily restroom cleaning, cleaning eating 
and food preparation areas, daily grounds clean up, minor facility repairs, and 
special emergency clean ups. Carpets are shampooed and tile flooring is cleaned and refinished every winter, spring, and 
summer break. A thorough deep cleaning of all areas is 
done every summer. District administration works daily with 
custodial and grounds supervisors to ensure a clean, safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The District allocates funds for completion of deferred maintenance projects which consist of major r
epair or replacement 
of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical 

teriors.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessm
ents for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in t
he administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have
 
successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Along with the academic supplemental services, Johnson School offers support programs for students and families. 
Johnson has a full time counselor that a
ddresses the social and emotional needs of students. In each class, teachers focus 
on character development through the Sanford Harmony curriculum.  We are also have a guidance technician, and we 
work with San Diego Youth Services to provide increased soci
al

emotional support for students.  Lessons and groups 
address topics such as peer interactions, making appropriate decisions, peer conflict resolution, and standard classroom 
behavior.
 
 
We welcome our Family and Community Engagement Team who focuses on bu
ilding strong bonds between parents and 
the school. They host a program called Parent University which is provided in three languages. The focus on the groups is 
to work with families to develop literacy skills while at home.
