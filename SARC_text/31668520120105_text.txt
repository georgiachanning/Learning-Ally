Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
We are fortunate to have a very modern campus.  This past year,
 
we replaced our bathrooms which was previously noted 
as an area in "poor" condition.  Our classrooms are clean, modern, well kept, and in good working condition.  We have 
two areas of concern that need to be addressed We need to create padded transitions 
between our turf field and the 
parking area.  When our solar panels were installed, it created a leak in one section of our roof, this will be repaired in 
summer of 2020

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil A
chievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California A
lternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achie
vement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance
 
to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Creekside we pride o
urselves on parent involvement.  In fact, we could not operate without our wonderful parents.  
Please see our PTO website for more information regarding involvement opportunity at our school.  
http://creeksidepto.org
 
 
72% of parents volunteered 30 or more 
hours for the school last year
 
 
47% of parents were involved in our LCAP survey
 
 
PTO Board has 12 parents
 
 
CCM Board has 7 parents
 
 
Our parents are welcome on campus and in our classes at anytime.  We believe that community is central to the success 
a 
student finds at school.  Parents know their kids best and support differentiation in the classroom.
 
 
Oppertunities include: Volunteering in the classroom, hiring committees, PTO, fundraising, Board membership, field trip 
support, curriculum committees, LC
AP teams and surverys, and open access to fauclty and leadership.
