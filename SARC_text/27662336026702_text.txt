and extracurricular activities

all of which encourage students to learn to reach their potential,

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Students attend school in a safe environment. The District supplies 
supervisory staff for recess and lunch. Support staff members monitor loading and 
unloading of the buses, and students participate in annual bus safety and evacuation drills.
 
 
 
 
The school maintains a closed campus where students are carefully 
accounted for and checked in and out through the school office. The school ensures 
safety for students by having all visitors check in at the office. Parent volunteers and other visitors wear ID badges, ident
ifying them as visitors to the 
campus.
 
 
 
 
San Be

tes and designated 
persons responsible in times of emergencies. The Safety Plan includes procedures and emergency evacuation for al
l situations ranging from a hostile 
intruder on campus to an earthquake or fire. A copy of the plan is kept on file in the school office for parents to examine. 
Our school staff reviews the 
plan at the beginning of each year, and also reviews emergency pro
cedures with the students. Monthly fire and quarterly emergency drills reinforce 
safety precautions. The Salinas Rural Fire Department conducts an emergency audit each year to assure compliance with State l
aws.
 
 
 
 
The School Safety Plan was most recently r
eviewed, updated, and discussed with school faculty on November 29, 2018
 
 
 
 
A phone tree has been established to dispense information to our site staff in the event of an emergency such as flood, earth
quake, natural disaster, or 
possible terrorism.
 
 
 
 
Seve
ral school staff members have received first aid training, including the health clerk. Student emergencies are handled quickl
y and appropriately. 
Parents are contacted immediately and, if necessary, 911 emergency personnel are contacted.
