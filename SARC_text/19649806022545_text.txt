Ediso
n Language Academy Programs and Goals
 
Edison Language Academy is a unique learning community 

 

elementary school. Edison serves approximately 470 students in Preschool through 5th Grade , all 
of whom study in Spanish and E

-
K
-
12 Language Academy. One of a small number of such established Pre
-
K
-
12 dual immersion 
programs in the nation, the Language Academy begins at Edison with approximately equal numbers 
of Span
ish
-
 
and English
-
speaking students enrolled in Preschool through Grade 5. Students can 
continue their immersion studies into middle school (where the Language Academy is a strand at 
John Adams Middle School) and into high school at Santa Monica High Scool.
  
Edison is a school of 
choice for all families, which also gives our learning community a unique character. Students come 
from the eastern edge of the Pico Neighborhood and throughout SMMUSD, with children in 
neighboring districts admitted on a space
-
avai
lable basis. An established program, Edison is 
celebrating its 31st anniversary as a dual immersion school. In 2016, Edison was named a National 
Blue Ribbon School 
--
 
a distinction awarded to 279 public schools and 50 private institutions, 
nationwide.
 
 
Edi
son's mission is to offer an academically rigorous program that promotes high achievement in 
all subjects, develops language proficiency in English and Spanish, and imbues children with an 
awareness of and respect for diverse cultures and communities. At E
dison, this learning occurs in a 
multicultural environment. Nearly three
-
fourths of the students are Latino/a (with roots in the 
United States, Mexico, Central America, and various Latin American countries). About a third are 
English language learners with
 
another 20% being bilingual at entrance. About  half of our students 
come from low
-
income families. Our dedication to being an academically rigorous dual language 

rmance 
Index (API) by more than 175 points over the last decade, with growth for all groups of students. 
Our 2013 API 

 
the last year for which an API is available 

 
was 884. Scores have remained high 

s in English Language Arts and Math being 
among the strongest in the district, overall and for all groups of students.  Edison has been awarded 
four Title I Academic Achievement Awards for exceeding achievement goals for all significant 
subgroups of studen
ts and has been awarded Honor Roll status from California Business for 
Educational Excellence from 2010
-
2016 as a high
-
achieving school that has narrowed achievement 
gaps.

Each year we strive to improve achievement for all groups of students and to narrow achievement gaps.  We work to  strengthen
 
first 
teaching in English Language Development and English Language Arts and provide English Learner students with appropriate aca
demic 
support services within the framework of the dual immersion program. We work toward the goal of having all Edison students 

 
including 
English learners 

 
be proficient or advanced in English language arts and math by the end of fifth grade. And as an
 
immersion school, we 
also want our fifth graders to demonstrate proficient or advanced status in Spanish language arts. Our School Leadership Team
 
is focusing 
on strengthening writing instruction for all students and working in Professional Learning Commu
nities to collect and assess student work 
and use the information to develop targeted and more effective and vertically
-
articulated instructional practices.  Other school goals 
detailed in our site plan include sustaining meaningful parental involvement an
d creating a safe and engaging school environment that 
emphasizes effort, builds self
-
esteem, and celebrates multiculturalism.
 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (Scho
ol Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
As a community dedicated to the informed involvement of all parents, Edison has developed a written parental involvement poli
cy with input from 
parents.  Input is gathered each year from parent groups, town hall meetings, and via an annua
l parent survey.  The Edison Site Council is charged with 
reviewing input and revising policies as needed.  As a school with a schoolwide Title I program, all our parents are Title I 
parents and we dedicate some 
of our Title I resources each year to helpin
g parents be informed, equipped to support students, and able to participate as partners with the school.  
Because we are a school rich in diversity, Edison has developed a set of Guiding Principles to help all who work with parents
, special events, or fun
draising 
construct programs and events that are accessible and respectful to all parents.   These Guiding Principles are shared with a
ll PTA and ELAC Board 
Members and all Site Council Members and may also be found on our school web page.
 
 
Edison has devel
oped a Family
-
School Communication Plan that is also detailed in the parent handbook.  Parent concerns or questions and fostering 
strong family
-
school communication are very important to our school. We want to hear from parents and be helpful in directing 
parents  to information  
may need or help resolve a problem. The plan details how to reach staff, how to schedule a meeting, times when teachers and a
dministrative staff are 
available for meetings or consultations, and who to contact with various types of 
concerns.    Each teacher shares the best ways for parents to contact 
him/her in welcoming letters and during Back to School Night.  Teachers all have voicemail and e
-
mail and reserve time to answer parent questions and 
talk with families about concerns. T
he principal has also blocked out time each week in her schedule to address individual parent questions about 
schoolwide issues or concerns that remain after an initial discussion has been held with the classroom teacher. We try to sch
edule appointments du
ring 
these hours both to provide ample opportunities for communication with parents and to reserve significant time for the princi
pal to be in classrooms to 
observe instruction and assist students and staff members.
 
 
Our parent handbooks also details diffe
rent Opportunities to Stay Informed, including:  Back to School Nights and Open Houses, Chats with the Principal, 
Fall Conferences (and follow up conferences for students with Academic Improvement Plans), observations in classrooms, progre
ss reports and re
port 
cards, regularly scheduled meetings of Edison parent groups, town hall meetings. the Edison and PTA Edison Amigos Web Sites, 
My School Anywhere 
(Room Reps use this program to email information to parents), Blackboard Connect (periodic dialers to phone
s), the weekly El Semanario school news 
letter, the Weekly PTA e
-
Blast, and monthly meetings of Edison parent Groups:  PTA and ELAC and the Edison Site Council.  When there are academic 
concerns about a student and a broader approach is needed, a parent, t
eacher or school specialist can convent  the Edison Success Team.  All parent
