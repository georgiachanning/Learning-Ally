School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The California Virtual Academy takes staff and 
student health and safety very seriously. Because the school will be a virtual 
school, there will be no need for a school building where classes are held on a daily basis. The administrative office 
currently complies with all ADA, OSHA, and local health an
d safety requirements. The school has obtained all necessary 
permits for these offices including a building and fire marshal inspection and/or a certificate of occupancy.
 
 
Immunization forms and other pertinent medical records will be kept (confidentially)
 
on file by the school administration. 
Parents are expected to ensure that their children obtain proper immunizations prior to matriculating pursuant to Chapter 
1 (commencing with §120325) of Part 2 of Division 105 of the Health and Safety Code. The school
 
may exempt students 
from enrolling who are not properly immunized pursuant to §48216 (a
-
c) of the Education Code. Those parents who are 
having difficulty obtaining immunizations for their children will be provided information on where to get immunized in 
their community.
 
 
All pertinent and required health and safety documentation is collected at time of hire or enrollment as appropriate. 

pies 
of employee records and student records can be made available at the request of the School District.
