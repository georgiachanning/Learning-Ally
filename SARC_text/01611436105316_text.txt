J
ohn Muir School, one of the smallest of the eleven elementary schools in the Berkeley Unified 

kindergarten through fifth grade students. Spanish
, Korean, Lao, Mandarin, Italian, Arabic, and 
American Sign Language are among the numerous languages spoken by our families. A walk 
through our campus takes you to the natural creek and redwood grove restored by the John Muir 
community, past edible garden
s managed by students, and through the landmark 1916 Tudor 
building symbolic of long
-
term positive values and the dignity of education.
 
 
The vision of John Muir School is to "achieve academic excellence, promote personal growth, and 
celebrate the joy and b
eauty of nature, community, diversity, and learning." At John Muir, students 
are the core of our work; therefore, every decision is made with their needs in mind and every 
action we take is based on our commitment to their success. We continually ask ourse
lves both 

this question sharpens our focus, directs our priorities, and helps us establish a clear vision.

About the SARC
 
By Febru
ary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fundi
ng Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state a
nd local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the sch
ool, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Williams legislation calls for the schools to have enough books in core classes for all students and asks districts to reveal
 
whether those books are 
presenting information outlined in t
he California content standards.  Textbook materials are adopted by the school board following a rotating adoption 
cycle for subject specific state adopted textbooks and instructional materials.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district administers a scheduled maintenance program to ensure that all classrooms 
and facilities are well maintained and in good repair. A work 
order process alerts district personnel of any maintenance needed to be performed and ensures that emergencies are given the 
highest priority.
 
 
Safety issues are the top priority for Maintenance
 
and Operations. District maintenance supervisors inspect school sites continually and complete repairs 
in a timely manner. They use a work order process to ensure an efficient, prioritized repair process. The district maintenanc
e staff has indicated that 
100% of all toilets on school grounds are in working order.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by 
the Office of Public School Construction.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate 
(Priority 6):

School Safety Plan
 
John Muir Elementary School was constructed in 1916 and earthquake retrofitted in the 1970's. The main building is an 
interconnected, partial two
-
story 
reinforced concrete building with a partial basement. The facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample 
classroom, field, creek and 
playground space.
 
 
The safety of students and staff is our primary co
ncern. Visitors and volunteers are required to check in at the main office. During lunch, recesses, and 
before
-
and
-
after school, staff members and the administrator supervise students and school grounds to ensure an orderly, safe environmen
t. The school 
is
 
always fully compliant with all rules, laws, and regulations concerning state earthquake standards and hazardous materials. A
n Earthquake, Lockdown 
or Fire drill is held every month for the students and staff.
 
 
Safety procedures, including elements of our
 
Comprehensive Safe School Plan, are reviewed with school and district staff at the start of each school year. 
The plan was last updated in the Spring of 2018.
