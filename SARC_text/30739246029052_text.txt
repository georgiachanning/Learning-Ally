By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Los Alamitos Unified School District (LAUSD) sets a high priority upon ensuring that high quality, standards

based 
textbooks and materials are available for every student to support instructional programs in the schools.
 
Prior to adoption, 
the Los Alamitos Unified School District conducts a thorough review of its curriculum to ensure that it is aligned with the 
California Standards for the Common Core. Under California law, the State Board of Education reviews K
-
8 textboo
ks and 
other instructional materials and then adopts those meeting specific quality standards. In the Los Alamitos Unified School 
District, textbooks considered for adoption are carefully reviewed by a committee of teachers and administrators. The 
most pro
mising programs are piloted using established criteria and guidelines. The recommended books are then 
approved by the Los Alamitos Unified School District Board of Education. To receive State instructional funds, the Los 
Alamitos Unified School District en
sures that it has fully complied with the requirements of Education Code Section 60119. 
The District has also conducted an annual public hearing ensuring the sufficiency of instructional materials. Each school 
maintains a library/media center which is supp
orted by District.

School Facility Con
ditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Los Alamitos Unified School District has always emphasized the importance of a clean, safe environment for learning. 
The environment of each campus is a matter of pride for students, staff and 
parents. Several schools have planted 
individual gardens, organized workrooms, and planned workdays for students and parents to enhance the facility. To 
insure that our facilities are in good repair condition, custodians at each site perform monthly inspec
tions and the District 
maintenance crew places safety as the number one priority. Weaver was built in 1953. Overall the school is in good 
condition. It is clean and well maintained. Voters within the District boundaries approved a local bond in 2008. Due t
o the 
passage of the Measure K Bond in 2008, all school sites within the District were modernized. The modernization work 
included the installation of new roofs, electrical, HVAC, plumbing, fire alarm and data systems. The doors, windows and 
flooring were 
replaced along with all new restroom fixtures. The modernization of Weaver Elementary School was 
completed in May, 2015.
 
 
Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by speaking 
with the school principal.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessm
ents for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in t
he administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have
 
successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

(School Year 2019

Each site has a Comprehensive Safe School Plan (CSSP), an Emergency Preparedness Plan, and a Crisis Intervention Plan. 
These three documents cover all aspects of campus safety. The plans are on file and available to all parents as w
ell as the 
general public per request. The CSSP is reviewed and updated on an annual basis by the School Site Council and 
subsequently Board Approved.
 
 
The CSSP is also on file at the Orange County Department of Education. The goal is to 
ensure a healthy, 
safe and drug
-
free environment on all Los Alamitos Unified School District campuses.

Student data is collected via District benchmarks and various formal assessments, such as 
CAASPP and Fountas & Pinnel Leveled Reading Assessments, to determine instructional needs for teachers. T
he District 
provides annual training to ensure accurate calibration in the administration of reading and mathematics assessments in 
order to assess site vs. district
-
wide areas of concerns.
 
 
Professional development is delivered by way of release time for t
eachers in the all of the Signature Practices.
 
 
Teachers 
new to the Los Alamitos Unified School District are placed on a five
-
year professional development plan.
 
 
Teachers are 
placed into cohorts according to the number of years with the District and atten
d professional development 
sessions.
 
 
Teachers are also released to attend pre
-
approved workshops and conferences with the expectation of 
disseminating their findings by way of instructional networking.
 
 
The District also provides content specific training
 
when 
needed by departments or grade level teams.
 
 
Teachers are supported through on
-
going, in
-
class coaching by District TOSAs.
 
 
Site administrators provide regular, 
ongoing feedback by conducting classroom observations, setting individual goals for teache
rs, and by providing time for 
teachers to collaborate and review data within grade level teams, subject teams and departments.
 
 
Teachers are provided 
opportunities to participate in instructional networking where teachers observe other teachers and debrief
 
on the 
instructional strategies employed within the lesson.
 
 
The practice of instructional networking is cross
-
curricular and non
-
evaluative.
 
 
 
Finally, in the 2019
-
20 school year, we have started focusing on technology implementation that impacts both te
acher 
instructional practice and student learning and creation.
 
 
This past fall, Weaver partnered with Hopkinson Elementary to 
provide professional development that emphasized how technology should be used as a tool to weave into solid 
pedagogical practice
