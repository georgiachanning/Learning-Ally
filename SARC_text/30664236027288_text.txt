By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the scho
ol, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., tes
t data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (dep
ending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

chool for four days and three 
nights each year. The arts are encouraged through a variety of classroom art lessons, assemblies,and community art contests. 
The use 
of 1:1 technology devices help students learn basic keyboarding skills as well as computer li

General
 
The District takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this e
ffort, the District 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. Safety 
inspections take place on a quarterly basis at all sites.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures tha
t repairs necessary to keep the school maintained and in working order are 
completed in a timely manner. An electronic work order process is used to ensure timely and efficient service. Emergency 
repairs have highest priority. A maintenance worker is assig
ned to the site, and is usually on campus once every week. No 
emergency repair needs exist at this site.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The District has standard cleaning procedures and guidelines used at each school site. Cleaning schedules are developed 
jointly between the principal and custodial staff to ensure a clean and safe school. Since January of 2006, the District has 

cleaned on a ro
tation schedule.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of 
study.

Parents at Barton School are given multiple opportunities to actively participate and be involved in their child's 
learning.
 
 
Barton has an 
extensive parent volunteer program which allows parents to participate in a variety of activities 
within their child's classroom. Parents can assist the teacher by completing specific activities, tutor students who are 
struggling, or complete other tasks a
s needed.
 
 
In addition Barton School has an active PTA. Barton has a large 
contingency of parents who participate in the monthly meetings as well as volunteer their time at assemblies and other 
activities.
