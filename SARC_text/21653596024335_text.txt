By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the District
 
Lagunitas School District is located in Marin County, 6 miles west of Fa
irfax. The small, rural school district is tucked away 
in a beautifully scenic woodland in the unincorporated San Geronimo Valley. Serving children residing in four local hamlets, 
the district is comprised of two schools that offer a unique variety of educ
ational programs. During the 2019
-
2020 school 
year, 240 students were enrolled; 4.16% qualified for English Learner support and 13.33% qualified for free or reduced
-
price lunch.
 
 
School Profile
 
Lagunitas Montessori is the only public Montessori school in M
arin County. The Montessori Program serves students in 
grade TK
-
5 and creatively combines academics, art and music to engage each child physically, cognitively, spiritually, and 
emotionally. The curriculum is based on the teachings of Maria Montessori with
 
adaptations designed to align with the 
Common Core State Standards, including ongoing assessment of student progress. Through cultural subjects of history, 
geography, botany, and zoology, students are encouraged to see themselves as citizens of the world 
and learn to recognize 
the interrelationship of all living things.
 
 
Lagunitas Middle School serves students in grades 6
-
8. Following a flexible block schedule format, students receive an 
intensive core curriculum in language arts, math, physical education,
 
science, and social studies supplemented with 
enrichment in art, drama, and music. By making learning exciting and relevant, students become actively involved in their 
education. Students are surrounded by a nurturing support system of parents, teachers, 
and friends to help them set and 
achieve their goals.
 
 
During the 2019
-
2020 school year, 57 students were enrolled in Montessori and 97 in Lagunitas Middle School.

ivities occur the year following the 

 
 

which textbooks and instructional materials have been provided to students. The 
Board of Trustees adopted Resolution 
#2020
-
07 which certifies as required by Education Code ยง60119 that (1) textbooks and instructional materials were 
provided to all students, including English learners, in the district to the extent that each pupil has a
 
textbook or 
instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to take home, 2) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials were 
provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consisten
t 
with the cycles and content of the curriculum frameworks in the following subjects: mathematics, science, history
-
social 
science, English/language arts, including the English language development component of an adopted program.
 
 
In addition to the core 
subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instruction materials 
used for health, foreign language, and visual/performing arts curricula. During the 2019
-
20 school year, health lessons 
were a component of the curren
t science curriculum, therefore, the provision of additional classroom materials for health 
lessons was not needed. Students participating in visual and performing arts course work have been provided with a 
textbook and supplemental materials to use in cla

standards and curriculum frameworks.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Lagunitas Elementary School provides a safe and clean
 
environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance 
and campus supervision.
 
 
Campus Maintenance
 
Lagunitas Elementary School staff is proud of the beautiful campus and is devoted to maintaining high standards regarding 
campus maintenance and gen

equipped to handle routine cleaning needs, general maintenance, and minor repairs.  Following a standard cleaning 
schedule, two full
-
time day custodians and one 
maintenance worker are responsible for the upkeep of both; Lagunitas & 
San Geronimo Schools.  The maintenance worker is responsible for general grounds keeping and minor repairs; larger 
projects are typically outsourced to third party contractors.  The cus
todian is responsible for daily cleaning of the 
Cafeteria/multi
-
purpose room, classrooms, offices and restrooms.  Teachers communicate unscheduled maintenance 
needs and special projects requests to the secretary who prepares a work order and forwards it to
 
the Chief Business 
Official (CBO), for review and approval.  The CBO assigns the work order to the custodian/maintenance worker or makes 
arrangements for a third party contractor to fulfill the request.  Emergency situations are given high priority and re
solved 
immediately by either the custodial staff or maintenance worker.
 
 
Every morning before school begins, maintenance inspects school facilities for safety hazards and maintenance issues that 
require attention before staff and students arrive on campus.
  
Any graffiti or signs of vandalism are removed immediately.  
Restrooms are checked periodically as a proactive measure in keeping facilities safe, sanitary, and stocked.

The principal and school staff continually monitor the campus and its surrounding a
reas as a proactive measure in keeping 
facilities safe and clean. Schools are required on an annual basis to conduct a formal inspection of designated areas and 
systems as required by state law to report the condition of their facilities. Lagunitas Element

inspection took place on January 29, 2018; the School Facility Good Repair Status table is illustrated.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance
 
Lagunitas School District allocates funding to assist with maintenance repairs or replacement of existing
 
school building 
components.  These components include but are not limited to, roofing, plumbing, electrical systems, playground 
structures, and exterior painting.  The District's Board of Trustees and Administration understand the need to fund the 
Distric
t's Deferred Maintenance program; therefore, funds from the general fund are transferred into the Deferred 
Maintenance fund to cover the cost for repairs and other general maintenance.  In fiscal year 2019
-
20 the Deferred 
Maintenance fund budgeted $130,000
 
and to date has expended $74,443 of these funds for painting, repairs to HVAC 
systems and roofs, general maintenance, and gymnasium projects, for both schools; Lagunitas & San Geronimo.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.

To support individual training needs, teachers participated in workshops sponsored by the Marin County Office of 
Education, which offers a broad
-
based variety of curriculum
-

cl
assroom instruction. Training activities took place during the summer recess, before school, and during school (on 
substitute release time). Teachers are encouraged to attend professional seminars and conferences related to their field 
of study, sharing th
eir experiences with fellow staff upon their return.
 
 
Lagunitas School District and the Marin County Office of Education jointly support new and veteran teachers in developing 
their teaching skills. Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA), a state
