By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-

Principal's Message
 
Burlingame Intermediate School (BIS) serves approximately 1100 students in Burlingame, a small suburban community on 
the San Francisco Peninsula. As 
the only middle school in our small district, BIS serves the entire population of sixth, 
seventh and eighth graders in the community.  Currently there are over 25 languages spoken in the homes of our students.
 
 
At BIS, it is our mission to educate our 
students and to ensure academic growth, achievement and challenge for all.  To 
achieve this, our staff holds high expectations for our students and themselves.  Collaboration and open communication 
with all constituents is at the heart of who we are as a s
chool.  We value the rich learning environment we offer, where 
our curriculum challenges students through instruction that meets the needs of our diverse student body.  Our students 
take an active role in their education, and all adults on campus expect th
em to be respectful, to persevere, and to 
appreciate their learning opportunities.   Our parents are proud to be active participants in the education process and are 
a welcome part of the school culture and community.  At the end of the day, we are proud t
o be a school that provides a 
strong foundation to prepare our students to meet the rigorous demand of high school and beyond.
 
 
BIS teachers participate in both collaborative and community teams to share best practices amongst staff.  Teachers have 
an acti
ve voice and the opportunity to influence the direction of the entire district through participation in a myriad of 

-
level Team Leads ar
e instrumental in determining the direction of the school and its academic program.
 
 
BIS uses block scheduling on Tuesdays and Wednesdays to enable students to go deeper over extensive time blocks.  On 
Tuesdays, students participate in Community Time, a bl
ock of time set aside for students to make connections with their 
peers and their teachers.  On Wednesdays, students are provided with the opportunity for eaching and extension 
activities as part of Trojan Time.  All sixth graders are scheduled under a
n A/B schedule, which allows them to explore 
both PE and a Connections class focused on Social Emotional Learning.
 
 
Students chose from a variety of elective courses where they practice 21st century learning skills, get the opportunity to 
learn about a ran
ge of topics such as business skills, visual art, music, world languages, robotics, and design thinking.  
Students apply skills learned in their elective classes such as curating art shows and creating an art gallery. Students have
 
the chance to participat

about technology, science, and mathematics.
 
 
We have active community membership in our PTA, our school site council, our Green Team, and our REACH program to 
help support our vision of all students learning at high levels. We have many family events and information nights, such 
as World Language Nights, Family Math Night, Arts education, and Ability Awareness events.  Community members also 
participate in and h
elp mentor our Genius Olympiad projects and weekly SPARK Talks.
 
 
BIS is extremely proud of the way that our staff, students and parents work collaboratively to provide an inclusive and 
challenging school environment where every child has the opportunity fo
r a bright future.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Student safety is one of our highest priorities at Burlingame Intermediate School, since students learn best when they are 
in a safe and orderly environment. Our School Safety Plan is a working document with 
updates made yearly. Each 
classroom is equipped with an emergency backpack that includes an evacuation map, important student information and 
a first aid reference guide to assist teachers with emergency procedures. Emergency drills are conducted monthly i
n 
conjunction with the Burlingame Fire Department.

We believe that ongoing professional development is the hallmark of our educational system in Burlingame. Teachers and 
administrators review student achievement data and choose topics relating to the most pressing issues from the previous 
year. Our teacher
s attend conferences outside the district and workshops within the district. Faculty meetings include 
professional development activities and the staff collaborate on a regular basis.
