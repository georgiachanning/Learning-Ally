By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Mill Street School will use the Benchmark Advance & Adelante (purchased in 2017) Language Arts curriculum to support 
ELA instruction as well as designated ELD.  In Kindergarten, students are e
xpected to identify and know the sound of every 
letter of the alphabet and begin to read C
-
V
-
C words. By the end of first grade, students should be reading a level 17 book 
with appropriate fluency and comprehension and be able to write a cohesive paragraph
 
with few errors. When students 
leave our school at the end of second grade, they are expected to be able to write a two
-
paragraph essay and read small 
chapter books. Student progress is measured using the curriculum
-
embedded assessments as well as teacher
-
created 
district progress assessments.
 
 
Math
 
Using the math adoption of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt GoMath! (purchased in 2016), teachers are building foundational 
skills in number sense, algebra, measurement and geometry to prepare students for the next ye
ar. Student progress is 
measured using curriculum
-
based assessments as well as teacher
-
created assessments that are aligned with the Common 
Core Standards and practices.
 
 
Science
 
Houghton Mifflin 
-
Students learn the NGSS science standards starting in kinde
rgarten (CA NGSS) as required by California 
Education Code 60605.85. The curriculum covers physical, earth, and life sciences. The scientific method of 
experimentation and investigation is woven through all of our science courses.
 
 
Social Science
 
Pearson
-
 
Students learn about citizenship starting in first grade. In second grade, we explore the lives of people who affect 

 
 
Textbooks
 
Our language arts, math, ELD, social studies and
 
science curriculum were selected from the SBE approved publisher's list. 
Each student has access to this curriculum and to his or her own textbook in every curricular area.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Overall our facilities are well maintained. The district continues to maintain the facilities, providing upgrades during the 
summer months and throughout the year. To assist in this effort, the district works with staff an
d parents as well as uses 
a Facility Inspection Tool developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of this 
survey are available at the school office, at the district office, or on the Internet at 
http://www.orlandus
d.net/Schools/Accountability/index.html.
 
 
This school has 27 classrooms, a cafeteria, a library media center, and an administration building. Each classroom is 
attended to every day and bathrooms are cleaned daily by our custodians. There are three playgro
unds. The school site 
has a security system in place, along with a public address system and bell system. Each classroom is equipped with age
-
appropriate furnishings. Students are supervised on the playground beginning at 7:30 am, at all recesses, and whil
e waiting 
to board the buses in the afternoon.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and
 
that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority. During the 2008
-
2009 school year, Hilliard Co was hired to map out a custodial schedule to make 
sure adequate time was allotted to each campus to ensure cleanliness. During the 2009
-
2010 year, local b
ond funds 
(Measure K), and state matching funds were used to install new air conditioning units for all buildings, install the perimete
r 
fence, and upgrade the playground equipment and flooring. Construction on our new cafeteria was completed in the 
summer
 
of 2013 and open at the beginning of the 2013
-
14 school year.  During the spring/summer of 2018 new solar 
structure that also provides shade was erected on the south playground area.  During the summer of 2019 new fascia was 
installed throughout Mill Stre
et School.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and

Parent 
Involvement
 
Ongoing research shows that family engagement in schools improves student achievement, improves social/emotional 
learning, reduces absenteeism, improves the likelihood of graduation from high school, and restores parents' confidence 
in their ch
ildren's education.  Mill Street School has an active parent participation component. We have a Parent Club that 
meets monthly to help the school organize annual events including the school carnival, winter concert, activity nights, 
student health fair, an
d other special events. Many classrooms have a "Room Parent" who organizes parent helpers in and 
out of the classroom and communicates important classroom information with other parents. Our parents also help 
teachers supervise students on field trips and 
with special activities in the classroom. Our parents serve on the ELAC/DELAC 
Committee and School Site Council. Mill Street School offers informational nights such as Back to School Night, Parent 
Conferences, Title 1 meeting, Open House, Learn with a L.E.
O., Halloween Carnival, and much more.  Our Dual Immersion 
program has also been actively designing parent involvement opportunities to reflect the culture of our language program 
with opportunities such as Dia de los Muertos celebration, Cinco de Mayo, an
d Ballet Folklorico.  All parents go through a 
district screening before they can help in the classroom. Parents can contact the school principal, Samuel M. Hess, at (530) 
865
-
1240 to find out how they can get involved at Mill Street School.
 
 
Homework
 
Our 
teachers assign homework four days a week. They send home a packet on Monday for students to complete during 
the week and return on Friday. Many teachers require parents to review and sign the packet each week. Teachers also 
assign reading for at least 15 
minutes per night. Students are also encouraged to work nightly on iReady and other digital 
learning programs.  We offer homework assistance throughout the school year through our after
-
school program, SPARK, 
and other targeted after
-
school targeted interv
entions.   Bilingual support is offered in the form of our bilingual services 
clerk and the SFRC as needed for families who need occasional assistance with communication or homework.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our buildings are well maintained and safe. The school social environment is very positive, highlighted by our Positive 
Behavior Intervention System or 
PBIS.  Mill Street School is committed to following our 4 PBIS traits.  These traits are being 
kind, being safe, being responsible, and being a problem solver.  These PBIS principals are further supported by our SEL or 
social/emotional learning coach.  The
 
principal, teachers, staff, parents, and students actively work together to ensure 

parents/guardians, students, and teachers sign the Parent Co
mpact at the beginning of each school year.  All classrooms 


es.  The principal and staff are present, proactive, 
and attentive to the needs of all our students to ensure that Mill Street is a positive, enriching, and safe learning 
environment.
 
 
Emergency action decisions are made through school, district, police an
d fire personnel. Key elements of the Safe School 
Plan cover fire, earthquakes, chemical spills, explosions, weapons, bomb threats, and evacuation and relocation 
procedures. Notification of emergencies are announced by the principal (or admin designee) via
 
an appropriate 
communication device or written notice. Teachers/staff are highly versed in the school safety plan and have been trained 
in action, evacuation, and relocation procedures.  By law, evacuation routes are posted in each classroom.  Fire drills
, 
earthquake drills, and Lockdown/Shelter in place drills are practiced three times each for a total of nine times throughout 
the school year.  Administration, support staff, supervisors, custodians, office personnel and teachers have access to a 
phone or 
2
-
way radio communication at all times.  Additionally, in 2019/2020, OUSD has systemized and upgraded its 
two
-
way radio communications to include a district and city
-
wide scan so that all school employees and administration 
with a two
-
way radio can communi
cate on a secured network.  In 2018/2019 a school
-
wide Volcom Intercom system was 
installed, further developing communication capacities across the campus.  Security cameras were installed and are active 
across the campus at different vantage points to add
 
an extra layer of security.  The school is free of graffiti and vandalism 
and security checks are done regularly.  The School Safety Plan is updated and board approved annually in accordance 
with Senate Bill 187.

Number of school days dedicated to Staf
f Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Built into the school year are seven modified "Banking" school days that allow for teacher professional development. 
Teachers, in collaboration with the administration and district, work together at the 
beginning of the year as a committee 
to plan the content of these days according to the previous year's assessment data and the school
-
wide/district 
professional development goals.  In addition to the "Banking" school days, OUSD offers a menu of profession
al learning 
opportunities referred to as "Up Days" where teachers have the option to pick from a variety of professional development 
topics to prepare for the upcoming school year.  These optional professional learning days are offered the week leading 
up 
to the start of the school year.
 
 
Other major areas of focus for professional development for the year 2019/2020 include the fidelity of use for iReady 
Math and iReady ELA, Illuminate training, Trauma
-
Informed School Training, Social and Emotional Learning
, Bartons 
training, Foundations in Sounds training, Benchmark Advanced/Adelante, and GoMath!.  In 2019/2020, to further develop 
the instructional practices around math, each classroom teacher will be provided a 4
-
part math professional learning 
series focu
sed on the standards of mathematical practices, number talks, and math applications.  Delivery of this staff 
development will be by third
-
party vendors, professional development conferences, release time to attend workshops 
during the day, "extra
-
duty" pai
d hours on weekends and/or vacations, or during staff meetings.  During the 
implementation of this staff development, teachers are supported through in
-
class coaching, mentor teacher, teacher
-
principal meetings, and collaboration with grade
-
level teams.
 
 
I
n addition to the above described "Banking" days and "Up Days" every Wednesday is a "modified" school day where 
students are released 60
-
minutes early and teachers and stakeholders meet in their grade
-
level professional learning 
teams. This collaboration t
ime consists of focused discussions on student data, essential standards, curricular pacing 
schedules, effective teaching strategies, formative assessment, and student intervention and enrichment groups.
