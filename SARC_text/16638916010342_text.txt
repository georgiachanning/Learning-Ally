By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: 
Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter
 
Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible st
udents may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The perc
entage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pa
rental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
General parental support and 
community support are critical factors that influence the success of any school. We are 
proud of the partnership we have formed with our parents and will continue to serve the needs of our community by 
providing every child a comprehensive and challenging 
educational program. The School Site Council (SSC) meets the first 
Thursday of every month at 3:15 pm and the English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) meets the third Thursday of 
every month at 9:00 am.  Both parent committees welcome all parents. These 
meetings cover a variety of topics including 
instructional goals, instructional materials, Common Core State Standards (CCSS) shifts, educational technology, and the 
planning, implementation, and evaluation of federal programs including Title I and Title I
II. In addition, the District holds 
a monthly English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC); each school site has one representative on the committee to 
bring forth any concerns of each school.
 
 
At the beginning of each school year, the school hosts a Back
-
to
-
School night. Parent conferences are held at the end of 

concerts, Literacy Nights and other various school
-
wide events where parents a
re encouraged to attend. The school 
encourages all parents to become involved and attend all parent meetings and school events. John C. Fremont also 
facilitates parenting classes using the Parenting Partners curriculum and workshop materials.  Parents who 
complete the 
workshop series are then able to facilitate the parenting workshops themselves in order to help support other parents at 
the school.
 
 
Parents and community members are invited to volunteer at the school in a variety of ways.  Various community
 
service 
clubs assist with the school's literacy and behavior goals.  Kiwanis Club of Corcoran sponsors a Literacy Night every winter 
and also recognizes students from every classroom on a monthly basis for their exceptional behavior and adherence to 
the s
chool's PBIS expectations.  Parents are encouraged to help out in the classroom and support their child's teacher, 
work in the school's PBIS store and luncheon, volunteer in the Book Fair, chaperone field trips and help out with school 
activities throughou
t the year.
 
 
Parental input is important to the continued success of Fremont Elementary. For information on parent involvement 
opportunities, please contact the school at 559

event of emergencies. Fire, earthquake, and lockdown dri
lls are held periodically to provide practice for students and staff. 
A Campus Safety liaison is involved in all safety drills and assists the site when needed. Additionally, campus safety is 
promoted by the use of campus supervisors, before school, after 
school and during the lunch periods.  In compliance with 

all times. In addition, all parent volunteers must submit a volunteer form 

site prior to volunteering in the classroom, at the school site, or chaperoning field trips.

Professional development is an ongoing activity that is 
offered to ensure that the Fremont staff keeps informed of new 
learning strategies, innovative teaching techniques, and the newest technology in the field of education. A weekly staff 
development opportunity is provided for the teachers on Wednesdays. Stud
ents are released early so staff has time to 
collaborate, coordinate, and work as an entire staff and grade level on aligning curriculum to instruction, analyze data 
from assessments, weave the student use of technology into instruction and map out curricu
lum to be taught. Students 
continue to show growth due to our committed staff and their increased knowledge gained through staff development 
that is offered both at the District and site level. Also, three teachers were sent to Achievement Teams looked at 
data and 
change teaching. These teachers now train the rest of the staff NTI training for teachers induction is given to teachers that
 
have completed all college work and are in their first years of teaching. They have a mentor that takes them through this
 
process.
 
 
Several programs to help students progress in reading and math were purchased along with professional development for 
teachers (MyOn, Imagine Math, Imagine Reading, STAR Math, Reflex, Rosetta Stone)
 
 
Paraprofessionals have received trained in EB
IL, Reading Comprehension and working with students with disabilities in 
Math. The Secretaries have had training on office management, program usage, and effective data input and various 
responsibilities to run an effective office.
