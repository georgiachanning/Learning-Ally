By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Mary Peacock Elementary School prepares students to navigate academic and social experiences with pride in themselves 
and respect for others.
 
 
Mary Peacock Elementary is a preschool through fifth grade school with an overa
ll student population of 322.  We are an 
"in town" school with three other elementary schools within a five mile radius.  Our school takes pride in its academic and 
behavioral support structures.  We believe it is essential to meet the needs of all student
s, regardless of background, 
strengths, or challenges.  Our team of experienced staff members work collaboratively to meet students where they begin 
and provide what they need to be ready for their future success. We have systems that encourage and celebra
te safe, 
respectful, and responsible behaviors and to discourage behaviors that do not promote these values.  We have academic 
supports within in the core instructional day which are available to any student.  We have an involved family community 
that prov
ides enrichment, special events, and community connections.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Calif
ornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternat
e achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for e
ntrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: Double dashes (

when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistic

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievem
ent level percentages are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents and the 
community are very supportive of the educational programs at Mary Peacock Elementary School. The 
school is very lucky to have an active parent and community volunteer base. Parents may participate in the 
Parent/Teacher/Student Organization (PTSO), which or
ganizes fundraisers and assists in school events. We also have an 
active and supportive School Site Council. Mary Peacock Elementary School hosts Back to School Night, Family Movie and 
craft nights, STEAM night, Family Reading Picnic, student music concert
s, and Parent Conferences. The school benefits 
from partnerships with local businesses and services, including the Foster Grandparent Program, and fifth grade mentoring 
program (provided through Del Norte County substance prevention programs).  We also hav
e a Dads Of Great Students 
program that encourages male role models to volunteer in our school.
 
 
Mary Peacock School implements positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS). The link between families and 
PBIS is an important one. We know that when
 
families are meaningfully involved in educational activities their children 
do better in schools. Families play an important part in their child's education and social development. The presence of 
parents in schools not only provides additional academic s
upports but also creates community and cultural connections. 
We have an open door policy and parents are always welcome to visit and volunteer in our classrooms and throughout 
the school.
 
 
Parents are encouraged and welcome to become involved in classrooms
 
or in various school groups and committees and 
may contact the office at 707
-
464
-
0301 for more parent involvement opportunities.

20)
 
 
The Comprehensive Safety Plan was last updated August, 2019.  We discuss safety planning and protocols frequently at 
staff meetings.  Our Crisis Response Team plan is updated annually.  The school is in compliance with all laws, rules, and 
regulations pert

includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster.  This plan has been reviewed by local law 
enforcement to increase our emergency p
reparedness.  Disaster drills are held regularly throughout the year.  Fire drills 
are held monthly, tsunami/earthquake drills are held annually.  In the event of an off
-
campus evacuation, students will be 
assembled and dismissed from the Del Norte High Sc
hool tennis courts at the corner of Washington Blvd. and Arlington 
St.  Procedures are in place in the event the campus needs to be secured or evacuated.  To ensure student safety, 
supervision is provided on campus at all times.  Visitors to the campus mus

at all times.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
Mary Peacock Elementary has a variety of programs to promote student achievement.  Academic services include 
Specialized Academic Instruction (as per IEPs) and Speech/Language services.  Special education programs are run in a 
"learning lab" model, providi
ng time in general education for all students as well as time to meet specific academic needs.  
English Language Development strategies are embedded in classroom instruction at every grade level for those learning 
English as a second language.  Two instruc
tional aides are funded to support academic needs at K/1 and 2/3.  We have 
school counseling services available, focusing on the academic and social behaviors that lead to student success.  We have 
a GATE program for our intellectually gifted students.
 
 
Th
ere are many opportunities for professional development for staff members.  Some are embedded within teachers' 
duty day (e.g. Staff collaboration meetings, data analysis, CHAMPS training, etc.) and some are offered outside the duty 
day (PBIS training, Yout
h Mental Health First Aid, MTSS, Be GLAD training and work time, etc.).
 
 
We are able to address the social/emotional development of our students through a school
-
wide focus on Positive 
Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS) program.  Students are recogn
ized regularly for safe, respectful, and responsible 
behavior.  We have a Responsible Student club to recognize students who make responsible choices routinely.
 
 
Mary Peacock prioritizes on student attendance.  Classes earn popcorn for accumulated days of 
high percentage daily 
attendance.  Students are honored each trimester for excellent attendance.  Saturday schools are available once a month 
for a day of attendance recovery.  Phone calls are made to parents/guardians for unverified absences and chronic a
bsence 
concerns.
