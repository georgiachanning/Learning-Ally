About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school i
n California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educat
ional agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally,
 
data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde
.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
communi
ty members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

We choose our textbooks from 
lists that have already been approved by state education officials.  We use a district
-
wide adoption process that includes 
teachers, parents, students and administrators.
 
 
We have also reported about our textbooks called for by the Williams legislation of 
2004.  We report to the board in September and four times a year 
about the sufficiency of our textbooks as well as any complaints.  This online report shows whether we had a textbook for eac
h student in each core 
course during the 2018
-
19 school year and w
hether those textbooks covered the California Content Standards.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Redding Achieve (CDS)  is a kindergarten through eighth grade elementary school located in a rural section of Redding, Califo
rnia. The school consists of 
three classrooms, one housing up to 12 kinderga
rten through second grade students, and one housing up to 20 third through fifth grade students, and 
the third housing up to 20 sixth through eight grade students. The surrounding area is ranch land and single
-
family dwellings. Major roadways include S. 
Bo
nnyview Road and SR273. Motor vehicle routes on and around campus generally do not become congested with the volume of traffi
c generated by 
the school at peak times. Students would travel to Bonny View School or the Fire station in case of an emergency.
 
 
R
edding Achieve (CDS) school is visible from several directions and can be patrolled by officers driving by the property. The 
property is surrounded by 
fencing which clearly defines the school boundaries. Wrought
-

 
The public does have access to school grounds 
when the school is closed. Those areas which do not have fencing are either accessible to foot traffic or have natural barrie
rs, such as plants and shrubs. 

 
boundaries are reasonably free of litter and debris. A marquis is located out front to identify the 

 
 
Exterior school walls are kept clean and free of graffiti.
 
Mechanical, electrical, HVAC, and other equipment located outside the school buildings are 
surrounded by protective enclosures. The wings are w ell lit. The buildings are linked together with fencing. Student gatheri
ng areas are visible from the 
office an
d classrooms at the back of the school. There are student
-
gathering areas at the front of the school that are visible from classrooms and the 
office. Pedestrian walkways are clearly defined. Walkways are well lit on the campus.
 
 
Signs are posted at most en
trances indicating that visitors must check in at the main office. The school is not designed in such a way that visitors mus
t 
pass through the main office before they can gain access to the rest of the buildings. Entry points are monitored throughout 
the 
day by staff and 
administrators. All accessible entrances are kept locked throughout the day. There are electronic monitoring devices on doors
 
and there is a program 
designed to detect doors that may be ajar or propped open. Door hardware is checked regula
rly to ensure proper function. School perimeter doors are 
designed for heavy duty applications. All doors are labeled or marked, inside and outside, numerically to easily identify for
 
emergency responses. There 
is a practice in place to leave doorway windo
ws uncovered. Leaving classroom windows uncovered is a common practice during school hours. There is 
an annual practice to check all door hardware, locks, latches, hinges, etc. to ensure maximum function.

More facts about the condition of our school build
ings is available in School Facility Good Repair Status. This report was called for by the Williams 
legislation of 2004. What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural inte
grity, electrical systems, heat
ing 
and ventilation systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are 
safe and in good repair. If 
anything needs to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit 
to make those repairs. The guidelines for this 
assessment were written by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams Legislation
. You can look at the six
-
page Facilities Inspection Tool used for the assessment on
 
the OPSC web site.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System
, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and gr
ade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive
 
disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

during their first two years of employment. Beginning in their third year, we 
evaluate teachers every three years.
