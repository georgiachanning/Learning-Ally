VISION:
 
The
 
vision
 
of
 
Bel
 
Air
 
Elementary
 
School
 
is
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
best
 
school
 
for
 
the
 
students
 
that
 
we
 
serve
 
by
 
ensuring
 
that
 
our
 
students
 
are
 
rigorously
 
prepared
 
for
 
success
 
in
 
college,
 
career,
 
and
 
life.
 
Together,
 
our
 
community
 
places
 
students
 
at
 
the
 
center
 
of
 
our
 
efforts
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
safe,
 
healthy,
 
high-quality,
 
full-service
 
community
 
school
 
for
 
all
 
students.
 
 
GUIDING
 
PRINCIPLES:
 
Bel
 
Air
 
Elementary
 
School
 
is
 
guided
 
by
 
the
 
following
 
principles:
 
 
High
 
Expectations:
 
Our
 
community
 
works
 
together
 
to
 
provide
 
all
 
students
 
with
 
a
 
quality
 
learning
 
experiences
 
guided
 
by
 
rigor
 
and
 
high
 
expectations.
 
We
 
believe
 
all
 
Bel
 
Air
 
students
 
can
 
go
 
to
 
college
 
and
 
realize
 
their
 
full
 
potential
 
in
 
career
 
and
 
life.
 
It
 
is
 
our
 
job
 
to
 
cultivate
 
this
 
potential
 
and
 
prepare
 
our
 
students
 
for
 
success.
 
 
Academic
 
Excellence:
 
Bel
 
Air
 
students
 
are
 
critical
 
thinkers
 
and
 
problem-solvers
 
engaged
 
in
 
learning
 
that
 
promotes
 
inquiry,
 
discovery,
 
use
 
of
 
technology
 
for
 
learning
 
and
 
academic
 
discussion.
 
All
 
students
 
are
 
prepared
 
for
 
success
 
in
 
college,
 
career
 
and
 
life,
 
and
 
they
 
are
 
proficient
 
in
 
all
 
subject
 
areas
 
including
 
literacy,
 
STEM,
 
computers,
 
arts,
 
history,
 
culture,
 
social-emotional
 
learning,
 
and
 
character
 
development.
 
 
Equity:
 
We
 
honor
 
and
 
respond
 
to
 
the
 
unique
 
needs
 
of
 
the
 
whole
 
student
 
and
 
we
 
are
 
committed
 
to
 
supporting
 
all
 
students
 
to
 
reach
 
their
 
full
 
potential
 
as
 
leaders
 
and
 
life-long
 
learners.
 
Students
 
know
 
and
 
celebrate
 
where
 
they
 
come
 
from,
 
and
 
their
 
language,
 
culture,
 
and
 
history
 
are
 
acknowledged
 
and
 
embraced
 
in
 
the
 
classroom.
 
Teaching
 
and
 
learning
 
are
 
differentiated,
 
relevant,
 
and
 
responsive
 
to
 
students™
 
lives
 
so
 
that
 
we
 
meet
 
each
 
student
 
where
 
they
 
are
 
and
 
ensure
 
every
 
student
 
is
 
prepared
 
for
 
success
 
in
 
college,
 
career,
 
and
 
life.
 
 
Integrity
 
/
 
Responsibility:
 
Students
 
are
 
taught
 
to
 
take
 
responsibility
 
for
 
their
 
actions
 
and
 
to
 
be
 
honest
 
with
 
themselves
 
and
 
others.
 
They
 
understand
 
the
 
difference
 
between
 
right
 
and
 
wrong
 
and
 
they
 
consider
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
their
 
actions.
 
Students
 
speak
 
up
 
for
 
members
 
of
 
their
 
school
 
community.
 
 
Accountability:
 
Our
 
community
 
holds
 
itself
 
accountable
 
for
 
student
 
success
 
and
 
places
 
students
 
at
 
the
 
center
 
of
 
our
 
work.
 
Students,
 
families,
 
and
 
teachers
 
are
 
informed
 
about
 
the
 
academic
 
progress
 
and
 
social-emotional
 
well-being
 
of
 
each
 
student.
 
Together,
 
we
 
engage
 
in
 
a
 
cycle
 
of
 
continuous
 
learning
 
and
 
improvement
 
to
 
support
 
student
 
achievement
 
and
 
school
 
quality.
