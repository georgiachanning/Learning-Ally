By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Silva Valley Elementary School, part of the Buckeye Union School District, is a TK/K through fifth grade school located in El
 
Dorado Hills, twenty
-
five miles east of Sacramento. Silva Valley 
Elementary School opened in 1992 with 450 students and 
was the first school in El Dorado County built for space saving year
-
round education. For the 2019
-
2020 school year, we 
have 475 students and operate using a traditional calendar.
 
 
The mission of our s
taff and community at Silva Valley Elementary is to provide a safe, nurturing, and challenging 
educational environment in which students are eager and willing learners, and have the opportunity to realize their full 
potential. Our goal is to help students 
gain positive self
-
esteem and self
-
respect, and learn to be successful, productive 
citizens now and in the future.
 
 
Our highly qualified staff establishes yearly school
-
wide and grade
-
level goals to keep staff focused on addressing areas 
of concern. Goals 
are based on multiple measures: the state standardized assessments, district
-
wide performance 
assessments, and classroom evidence. It is our goal to decrease the percentage of students identified as performing 

ach subject
-
content area and to increase the percentage of students 

-
content area. At Silva Valley School we are pleased 
that our students perform at high academic levels as indicated by th
e SBA (Smarter Balanced Academic) State Assessment.
 
 
Students, parents, and staff all hold high expectations for one another, and all students are expected to excel academically 

. Silva Valley is a special place where many 
parent and community volunteers contribute to the effectiveness of the school program.
 
 
Our diversity is growing as well, with a student population that is 70% Caucasian, 11% Hispanic/Latino, 7% Asian, 7% Two 
or
 
More Races, 1% African American, and 4% Other. Special Education students are mainstreamed to receive a balanced 
curriculum in the least restrictive environment. Both staff and parents pay close attention to subtle changes in our 
students that may indicat
e a need for intervention or additional support. Our community is generous and caring in an 
atmosphere where cooperation and respect is highly valued. Special programs at Silva Valley include enrichment programs 
for all students such as Meet the Masters, L
ife Lab, Cross Country, Team Eagle, Oral Interpretation, Spelling Bee, Green 
Team, Choir, and Band.
 
 
Buckeye Union School District has implemented a comprehensive state standards based report card which holds 
students/teachers accountable for specific acad
emic achievements. Silva Valley teachers utilize district adopted research
-
based materials to guide student instruction. In order to improve student performance in reading, our School Site Council 
supported the creation of an in
-
school Reading Intervention
 
Program that serves first through fifth grade students in need 
of additional reading instruction.  We also have a cross
-
age reading program and a partnership
-
tutoring program with 
neighboring Oak Ridge High School. Silva Valley continues to partner with t
he Sierra Foothills Assistance League to create 


 
3. Identified students 
in grades 1 

 
5 receive intervention in Math concepts. Our EL students participate in a di
strict adopted EL program four 
days per week. Utilizing early release Wednesday, teachers collaborate on a weekly basis evaluating student performance 
on formative and summative assessments to drive their instruction. Our goal is to have all students perfo
rming at or above 
grade level standards.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement 
(Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate As
sessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement stan
dards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the Uni
versity of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Silva Valley 
Elementary understands the positive correlation between parent involvement and student success. For this 
reason, the school continually searches for avenues to involve parents and the community to participate in the education 
of our students. The school gr
eatly benefits from its highly active and supportive parents in the Parent Teacher Association 
(PTA).  In addition, Silva Valley is very appreciative of the extensive support provided by volunteers in the classroom, in 


Foothills Assistance League to bring literacy support to students through the "Books and Beyond" program. In this 
program, volunteers read with students focusing on reading comp
rehension throughout the school year.
