Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

This commitment is exemplified through our rich and rigorous academic program, our successful fine

device initiative program, our character building and self esteem program, and our emphasis on a 
variety of physical education activities to promote a healthy lifestyle.
 
 
Serving approximately 615 students from preschool

also provides effective learning programs for students with Autism Spectrum 
Disorders.
 
 
Our goal is for each and every student at Turtleback to reach his/her highest potential through our challenging 
and differentiated educational program.
 
 
We believe tha
t as elementary educators we have a professional as well as moral 
obligation to successfully establish a
 
firm learning foundation for all of our students.
 
 
We are committed to ensuring that 
all students are solidly equipped with the necessary skills, knowl
edge, and character qualities to be successful at the 
secondary level and ultimately at the college level.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Poway Unified School District ensures that students attend clea
n and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each of its schools is maintained in good repair.  A work order proce
ss is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and well maintained. 
 
A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A night custodial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms and offices daily.  
The district has adopted cleaning standards for all schools.  A summary of these standards is available at the d
istrict offices.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Learning at Turtleback is a collaborative effort enhanced by an environment where creativity, flexibility, and academic 
success are valued and encouraged. We foster ongoing learning for our students, staff and parents. To that end, 
Turtleback's Bishop Cent
er for Adult Learning is frequently used as a meeting room, but it is also the center for our lending 
library.
  
Parents and teachers regularly check out books and CDs on topics such as positive behavior management, 
helping
 
students to
 
cope with family chan
ges, and effective strategies for addressing special student learning needs
 
at 
home and in the classroom. The
 
success
 
of our Center for Adult Learning lies in the ability to provide timely information 
to the adults working most directly with our students. 
The Turtleback staff continues to make a concerted effort to include 
all parents in their child's educational program, no matter how little time the parent has to give.
 
 
 
We are very fortunate to have an exceptionally active Parent Group, The Turtleback Ed
ucation Foundation, which donates 
over 40,000 hours of volunteer time annually and sponsors such important
 
service projects and fundraisers
 
as the Harvest 
Festival, Art Corps Program, Music Education, Trekkers Running Program, APEX Fun Run, school

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Turtleback teachers have declared the
 
ongoing implementation
 
of
 
the Positive Behavior Support System as
 
an 
important
 
organizational initiative to continue addressing
 
over the next
 
several years. The purpose of thi
s proactive 
system is to create a safe, calm, and nurturing environment for all learners.
 
 
Students are trained in safe behaviors on the 
playground, in the classroom, and around the school. Behavior assemblies are held annually to review student 
expectatio
ns and campus supervisors are trained in proactive and positive behavior management strategies. The school
-
wide Character Counts program serves as a
 
foundation for teaching the pillars of good character.
 
 
The monthly pillar 
themes are addressed routinely t
hrough our school
-
wide morning announcements and the Friday Flag assemblies.
 
 
We 
continue to use the "Bucketfillers for Life" program at Turtleback. Students are encouraged to "fill more and dip less!"
 
 
Our emergency plans are reviewed and refined annually
.
  
We regularly conduct earthquake, fire and lockdown drills to 
ensure that students and staff know precisely what to do in an emergency situation.
 
 
We are committed to keeping our 
students and staff physically and emotionally safe at all times.

Research supports the positive effects professional development has on increasing student learning. All teaching staff is 
afforded the opportunity to participate in district and site sponsored professional development.  These workshops are 
presented in a s
emester or year
-
long series and support a wide variety of professional development. These include the 
use of effective instructional strategies, implementing the use of computer technology in teaching and learning, critical 
reading, writing and mathematics
 
strategies, effective use of assessments, positive discipline in
-
services, and multicultural 
training. Teachers and administrators are actively involved in professional development activities at the school, district, 
state, and national level.  The Poway 
Professional Assistance Program (PPAP) provides support for new teachers. Teachers 
are encouraged to participate in the National Board Certification process and recognized by the Poway Unified School 
District when they earn NBCT status.
