School Description
 
Principal's Message
 
 
The goal of Kamala School is to provide each student with a challenging and rigorous curriculum. 
We believe every child can achieve academic success. To this end, every child will be provided with 
quality instructional experiences, which recognize, support
, and maintain high expectations for all 
students. Test results show that we have made academic gains reflecting our school commitment; 
however, we continue to examine assessment results to refine our instruction to help ensure all 
students are successful.
 
 
Our staff continues to implement curriculum that is based on the Common Core State Standards in 
Language Arts, English Language Development (ELD), and Math. Kamala is a biliteracy school with 
a focus on art and technology.  Our goal through the biliterac
y program is that every student will 
be bilingual and biliterate by 8th grade.
 
Strengthening students' math abilities and writing across the curricular areas will be the primary 
focus of our instructional improvement process.  Through the use of schoolwide
 
programs such as 
IXL and AR, students can practice their math skills and strengthen reading comprehension.  These 
programs give teachers valuable information on student's skills and allow teachers to provide 
targeted instruction and interventions.
 
 
We hav
e an Outreach Consultant and Counselor to assist us in our efforts to meet the needs of all 
our students and provide families with the help they need in motivating our students to achieve 
academic excellence.
 
 
As principal I would like to extend a warm wel
come to all parents to join with our staff in supporting 
Kamala School's vision and mission. It will take the efforts of all of us to provide a strong 
instructional program and ensure all our students achieve their full potential.
 
 

ent achieves his or her full potential.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by st
ate 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are requ
ired to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is t
o be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members 
should contact the school principal or the 
district office.
