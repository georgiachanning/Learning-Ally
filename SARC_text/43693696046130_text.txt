By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most
 
Recent Year)
 
 
The district makes every effort to ensure all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the district
 
uses 
a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The r
esults of this 
survey are available at the school office and at the district office.
 
 
School facilities are upgraded whenever possible to support and maintain a safe, clean and secure campus. Sufficient 
classroom, office, library, playground, staff space, 

the instructional program. The Alum Rock School District maintenance staff, in conjunction with day and night custodians, 
ensure the school buildings and grounds are safe, clean, and 
in good repair. Rigorous daily custodial schedules ensure that 
classrooms, lavatories, serving kitchens, eating areas, offices, and playgrounds are clean for both student and staff use. 
There is an ongoing and strenuous reinforcement of bathroom etiquette.
 
Bathrooms are checked after each recess and 
after school. There are at least one Beautification Day each year. Parents, teachers and sponsors come to the school on a 
Saturday and plant flowers, clean windows, pick weeds, paint, and/or clean up surrounding
 
streets.
