About the SARC
 
By Febru
ary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fundi
ng Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state a
nd local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 

re classrooms and campus grounds are well
-
maintained and kept 
safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) employs an electronic work order sys
tem enabling school staff 
to communicate unscheduled maintenance need
s, urgent repairs, or special projects. Most of the school's repairs and maintenance projects are 

ither by the school custodian 
or 
district maintenance staff, based upon the nature of the situation. Day and evening custodians work closely as a team and wit
h the principal for routine 
maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events preparations. The principal and day custodian c
ommunicate daily to discuss campus cleaning 
needs and safety concerns. Every morning before school begins, the custodian and principal inspect facilities for safety haza
rds, graffiti, and other 
conditions that require removal prior to students and staff en


 
procedures, use of 
chemicals, and us
e of equipment. The day custodians are responsible for following an established set of cleaning standards and prioritization 
procedures 
for general campus maintenance. The day custodian checks restrooms twice a day as a proactive measure in keeping facilit
ies well stocked, safe, and 
sanitary. The evening custodians are responsible for thorough cleaning of classrooms, office areas, and restrooms. Groundskee
pers are dispatched by 
the district office to perform general maintenance of landscaping, gardening, sp
orts fields, and irrigation systems.

[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities);
