Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
For a variety of reasons, not all students are successful in a traditional school setting. Some of these students find the 
elementary community day program better suited
 
to their needs, and are able to work successfully. It is important to have 
community day, continuation high schools and other programs such as independent study as alternatives to dropping out 
of school. However, while these programs can provide an atmosp
here that will help many students, they still require effort 
on the part of the student. If the student has no motivation or academic goals at all, they will not succeed regardless of 
the structure of the program. 
 
 
Our goal is to graduate young 
adults who are:
 

 
Perceptive Thinkers
 

 
Collaborative Contributors
 

 
Innovative Producers
 

 
Self
-
directed Achievers
 

 
Adaptable Problem Solvers
 

 
Effective Communicators
 
The mission of our Community Day Schools is to meet the California Department of 
Education regulation 48916.1 (a) "At 
the time an expulsion of a pupil is ordered, the governing board of the school district shall ensure that an education 
program is provided to the pupil who is subject to the expulsion order for the period of the expulsi
on", the Fall River Joint 
Unified School District established the Community Day School Program. This program provides students the opportunity 
to earn readmission to the regular program at the end of the required term and to prepare those who do not qualif
y for 
readmission for the next steps in their educational career.
