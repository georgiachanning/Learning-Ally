By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required
 
to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be
 
consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/
sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.
gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Our small classes are designed to provide additional op
portunities for student academic and social
-
emotional 
development. Students are more likely to succeed in a small school, where teachers and administration connect with each 

nstructional practices and provide more 

-
emotional needs. 
 
 
As a school of choice, the REALMS vision is to create a growth
-
 
minded school by providing programs otherwise unavailable 
in our 
community where all students are empowered to reach their full academic and social
-
emotional potential. The 
REALMS mission is to pursue programs and innovative resources to create a unique and successful learning environment 
for all students.
 
 
REALMS is co
mmitted to providing a successful, safe, and rigorous educational experience aligned to the State Standards,

One goal of REALMS is empowering parents as educational partners. Parents know their voice and participation at REALMS 
influences the development of the whole school and its components. Parents have opportunities to participate in a variety 
of meaningful w
ays at the school site and their presence on campus and assisting teachers in the classroom is most 
important. REALMS encourages all groups to participate in and share responsibility for the educational process and 
educational results. In order to achieve 
this important end, REALMS shares local control with the School Site Council 

to engage the support of the community. The SSC may make 
recommendations about issues related to REALMS and 
participate in reviewing parental and community concerns. The SSC consist of representatives of the following parties: 
Principal, teachers, parents, and community members. The Chief Executive Officer is re
sponsible for communicating all 
SSC policy recommendations to the Board of Trustees.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
REALMS provides a safe environment for learning through a closed campus policy. Many individuals visit the campus as 
volunteers or to 
participate in school events. To maintain a safe and secure environment, all parents and visitors are 
required to check in at the school office upon arrival. Supervision begins at 7:30 am, school begins at 7:55 and the gates 
are locked by 8:00 am, and unlo
cked after 2:55 pm for dismissal. During the day the only access to the campus is through 
the front door. All visitors are required to sign in and wear a badge while on campus. During recess and lunch, playground 
supervisors monitor student activities on t
he playground while members of the administration circulate though the 
campus greeting students and monitoring student behavior. When students are dismissed at the end of the day, 
administrators, teachers, and support staff oversee the student pick
-
up area
 
to ensure students depart in a safe manner.
 
 
The school safety plan is updated annually by March 1 and includes the following components:
 
Assessment of Current Status of School Crime
 
Programs and Strategies that Provide School Safety
 
Safety Procedures dur
ing the Regular School Day
 
Hiring Practices that Provide Safety to Students
 
Emergency Preparedness
 
Disaster Plans
 
Student Discipline
 
Uniform Complaint Procedures

REALMS a TK

6th grade public charter school is in it's first year of operation effective July 1, 2019. Therefore data related 
to 2018

19 is unavailable. However, below is data from the Ridgecrest Charter School 
which was previously housed in 
REALMS's current school facility:
 
 
Ridgecrest Charter School develops Individual Learning Plans (ILPs) for all students in grades TK
-
 
5 and Personal Learning 
Plans (PLPs) for all students in grades 6
-
8. These ILPs and PLPs in
clude relevant strategies to meet all of the education 
needs of each child. It is the goal of Ridgecrest Charter School to meet the educational needs of every child in every 
classroom, and to utilize general education interventions first, where possible, t
o minimize the need for special education 

 
first month of school using formative, summative and computer based assessments. This da

prior ILP, benchmark assessment and CAASPP (grades 3
-
5) data helps the teacher determine the level of support or 
enrichment each student needs. For students needing supports, the Individual Learning Plan will include appropriat
e 
interventions that may include in
-
school tutoring, after
-
school tutoring, reading intervention, peer tutoring, Student Study 
Team intervention plan, or supplemental instruction and programs. Students needing to be academically challenged 
through enrichme
nt, the Individual Learning Plan will include extension opportunities that promote further development 
of soft skills and opportunities, peer tutoring, scaffolded and differentiated projects and assignments to meet the needs 
of advanced learners.

Persona
l Learning Plans for middle school students in grades 6

8 differ from Individual Learning Plans in student 
involvement. Whereas ILPs are teacher created, PLPs are student created portfolios with teacher guidance. PLPs include 
student created long and short
 

are designed to help students take ownership of their learning and motivate students.
 
 
When the ILP or PLP is not meeting the educational needs of the student and the te
acher(s) have met with parents and 
students to modify the plan, the student will be referred to the Student Study Team. The Student Study Team uses a 
systematic problem
-
solving approach utilizing teachers, administrators, parents, the student, counselors, 
psychologists, 
relatives, and community persons. The Student Study Team is not a pre
-
requisite to evaluation for special education 
eligibility. 
 
 
Ridgecrest Charter School is a growth focused school. We have high expectations for all students and are commi
tted to 
working with students who are not meeting outcomes to help them achieve at expected levels. Formative, summative, 
and benchmark assessments are used to identify struggling students. Students who perform below the acceptable level 
may receive a mix 
of intervention services, including: in
-
class individual tutoring by classroom teachers; in
-
class small
-
group tutoring by classroom teachers; before
-
or after
-
school tutoring by non
-
classroom educators in a one

one or in 
small groups; participation in a 
specialized support class taught by a literacy specialist or other educator. 
 
 
Students targeted for additional intervention will include, but are not limited to, students who meet the following criteria:

fferent levels. 
Instruction, assignments and projects are differentiated to extend learning for students above grade level. Formative, 
summative, and benchmark assessments are used to identify students performing above grade level. For example, one 
student
 
reading at grade level can sit next to another student doing the same activity at three grade levels higher. Small 
class sizes and looping assist with differentiation of instruction because classroom teachers understand each individual 

udents achieving above grade level can be accelerated to a higher grade level for math or English
