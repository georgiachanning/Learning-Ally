About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information ab
out the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend
 
to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements,
 
see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School 
Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The San Mateo
-
Foster City School District makes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe and functional. To assist in these
 
efforts, the 
District has developed and the Board of
 
Trustees has approved, a District
-
wide Facilities Implementation Master Plan in order to bring each school site 
up to district facility standards for educational excellence. To support that effort, in 2008 the community passed a $175 mil
lion facilities bo
nd to repair, 
renovate, upgrade and increase capacity at District schools. Bond funding has been used to upgrade facilities over the past 1
0 years. A lunch shade 
structure and age
-
appropriate play structures were added to the campus, student classroom furn
iture was replaced, exterior painting was completed 
and perimeter fencing was installed for school security.
 
 
In 2015, the community once again passed a $142 million bond (Measure X). Phase I is well underway, adding classrooms and a g
ym at Abbott and Bore
l 
and a gym at Bayside Academy, in addition to a new fourth elementary school in Foster City.
 
 
With the passing of the State Facilities Bond in November 2016, the District will seek any State Modernization matching funds
 
on a percentage basis to 
assist wit
h the expenditures for any major planned modernization work projects.
 
 
The District's Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are c
ompleted in a timely manner, 
while the Operations staff ensu
res that the schools are kept clean. A work order process through a program called "Akita Box" is used to ensure efficient 
service; emergency repairs are given the highest priority. In addition to responding to emergency repairs in a timely manner,
 
the mai
ntenance department 

 
 
Most District schools are staffed with at least one day and one night custodian to provide a clean and hazard
-
free environment. Some of the 
larger 
schools, particularly the middle schools, are staffed with one day custodian and two or three night custodians. The Principal
, along with the maintenance 
staff, work with the custodians to develop cleaning schedules to ensure clean and safe schools.
 

which are available at the District Office. In addition, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the Stat
e of California's Office of Public 
School Construction to evaluate 
the conditions of each schools facility. This evaluation is completed annually for each site. The following school site

families in an effort to support our students. To this end, there is a wide variety of opportunities 
for parent involvement. Through PTA, Site Council, English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), and volunteerism in the classr
oom, in the office, on the 
pla

The San Mateo
-


creating a safe and caring school community where all students and families feel welcomed, valued and respected. These Guidin
g Principles (respect, 
responsibility, appreciation of differences, honesty, safety and life
-
long lear
ning) communicate the expectations for behavior to students, parents, 
teachers and administrators and are updated and reviewed yearly. The rules were developed to be consistent with State Educati
on Code, policies of the 
San Mateo
-
Foster City School Distric
t Board of Trustees and the School District's Strategic Plan.
 
 
Comprehensive School Safety Plans, developed individually for each school in conjunction with the San Mateo County Office of 
Education and City 
Services, include disaster 
preparedness and emergency procedures. The School Safety Plans provide role responsibility guidelines and processes required 
to address major emergencies. Annually, the District utilizes the services of School Innovations & Achievement to review each
 
schoo

determine if all required components are included and to offer feedback and suggestions.
 
 
California Education Code Section 32280 requires school fire evacuation drills, as well as one law enforcement lockdown drill
, and the District org
anizes 
two District
-
wide drills each year, using different scenarios that test the Big Five Safety Protocols (Shelter in Place, Secure Campus, Dr
op, Cover and Hold 
On, Lockdown/Barricade and Evacuation). These drills involve a District Command Center for c
ommunication with each school/program site and full 
emergency set

The San Mateo
-
Foster City School District is committed to providing quality professional development opportunities for all staff. Training 
is available 
through three 
professional development days, staff meetings, scheduled release times during the school year, on early release days and duri
ng the 
summer. Our primary focus for professional development is aligning instruction to meet the California State Standards and th
e implementation of our 
adopted materials for mathematics and English Language Arts/English Language development. Professional learning opportunities
 
integrate content 
development and research
-
based instructional practices to meet the needs of all learners
, especially English Learners, Students with Disabilities and 
Socio
-
economically Disadvantaged. Professional Development in SMFCSD is grounded in the California State Standards and the research
 
from the 
California State Adopted ELA/ELD, Mathematics and NGS
S Frameworks. Elementary teachers have the opportunity for training in language and literacy, 
science and mathematics. Middle School teachers receive subject specific professional development on the California Standards
 
and strategies to support 
conceptual
 
understanding and improve student learning.

Teachers engage in a variety of Professional Development structures including, site or department specific PD, teacher learni
ng communities within and 
across sites and in departments or grade levels 
-
 
both in l
arge and small groups. Our district also coordinates district
-
level training with site
-
based 
professional development opportunities based on site data. Over the last year, district and site leaders developed profession
al learning opportunities by 
evaluatin
g and adjusting our professional growth strategies, first by gathering immediate feedback (e.g., exit tickets and feedback su
rveys) from teacher 
and leader training and collaboration sessions. This data was then used to adjust and focus training and collab
oration strategies during the year. We also 
evaluate and adjust professional growth strategies through on
-
going examination of student performance data (academic and wellness). District 
leadership meets quarterly with school leaders to review current stude
nt data, to identify the professional growth causes for student successes and 
challenges, to monitor the impact of key professional growth strategies and to plan forward. This work then informs the distr

SPSA. In parallel with thi
s work, site leaders lead the same process with teacher teams using more specific data (e.g. grade
-
level and classroom data), 
where they couple that data with teacher reflections on their professional learning and plan month
-
to
-
month adjustments in profess
ional learning 
strategies and yearly adjustments in their SPSAs. District leaders also lead a similar process with SMFCSD teacher union repr
esentatives to elicit their 
feedback on the district professional growth strategies and to get their recommendations
 
for strategy adjustments in the district LCAP. Additionally, 
starting this year, SMFCSD will gather once
-
a
-
year survey feedback from teachers on their professional learning needs and on their experience of current 
strategies which will inform yearly adjus
tments to LCAP and SPSA professional growth strategies.
 
 
Our beginning teachers also receive additional professional development provided by our District
-
based Induction program. Veteran teachers can 
participate in a Peer Assistance Review (PAR) program fo
r individual support.
