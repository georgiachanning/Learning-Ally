About the SARC
 
By February 1 
of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding For
mula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and loc
al priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, p
arents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

following: monthly facility safety inspections; child abuse reporting procedures; teacher notification of dangerous pupils pr
ocedures; disaster response 
pro
cedures; procedures for safe entering to, and exiting from, school; sexual harassment policy; suspension and expulsion polici
es; dress code; and 
discipline policies. The Safe School Committee evaluates the plan annually and updates the plan as needed.

The district 
annually holds professional development days in which teachers are offered a broad
-
based variety of professional learning opportunities in 
curriculum and instructional practice in support of a continuous cycle of improvement. Professional learning opportun
ities include grade level and/or 
content
-
specific programming on full and partial days as well as early student release day opportunities. Student achievement data co
ntinues to be the 
determining factor in the selection of professional learning topics. The
 
primary areas of focus for professional learning in the last three years have been 
in the area of supporting teachers as it relates to math, and ELA/ELD, history
-
social science, and science curricula, content standards, frameworks, as 
well as the use of s
tudent data to improve instructional practice. Professional learning is developed and facilitated by district staff, Teachers
 
on Special 
Assignment, as well as consultants and coaches who specialize in content
-
area pedagogy. Professional learning is struct
ured in job
-
embedded workshops 
and professional learning communities which include collaborative lesson planning, lesson study, classroom observations and c
oaching support, and 
student work/data analysis. Professional learning for all teachers includes str
ategies and pedagogy to support all learners access rigorous, grade
-
level 

nt of academic language 
and literacy.
 
 
Beginning in 
2017 through 2020, all teachers participated in six days of systematic, district
-
wide professional learning with a focus on instructional 
strategies in support of our three student success drivers: academic discourse, collaborative practices, and cognitive
 
rigor. In addition, several opt
-
in days 
of various ongoing professional learning offerings were held to differentiate among grade and content levels and included sta
ndards
-
aligned instructional 
practices in support of all learners, including English learn
ers and students with disabilities; college and career readiness; and social
-
emotional support.
 
 
In addition to the aforementioned, district and site learning has focused on developing Professional Learning Communities (PL
C) focused on a cycle of 
continuou
s improvement. In accordance with this initiative, teachers work in grade levels and study data and student work along with c
urriculum 
frameworks, standards, district and state assessments, and state
-
approved adoptions to establish learning goals, plan les
sons and develop common 
formative assessments. Teachers meet regularly each week and also for extended learning opportunities each trimester. The dis
trict initiative to develop 
Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) provides multiple training 
opportunities throughout the year for the PBIS team. At Hodge, staff 
engage in extended learning related to PBIS and the Multi
-
tiered Systems for Support  (MTSS) provided for our students to support both their academic 
and social, emotional, and behavioral
 
development. On
-
going workshops designed to identify/assess student needs related to social, emotional, and 
behavioral development are part of the professional growth plan at Hodge.
