School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Emergency Information: Parents are requested to complete emergency information every year. This information is of vital 
importance to the school program since this information advises the school of who to contact in the event of an 
emergency. The informati
on also includes who the student can be released to in case of a disaster. In addition, the 
information is used by the teachers and the office for attendance. It is the parent's responsibility to immediately notify 
the school of any changes in the data.
 
 
A
 
school safety plan is revised and adopted each year by the School Safety Committee. The plan was last reviewed on 
10/24/18 and shared with the staff. Specific procedures for evacuation of buildings, communication and disbursement of 
emergency supplies are
 
outlined in an emergency handbook in the office and on the school website. Specific 
responsibilities are given to adults for the supervision of students in a safe location when a disaster occurs. Evacuation 
drills, "secure campus" drills, "lockdown" drill
s and earthquake disaster (drop, cover, and hold on) preparedness are 
practiced during the school year in cooperation with the local fire and police departments. Staff and parent telephone 
trees and emergency supplies are updated each year.
 
 
Key elements o
f the emergency procedures as described in the Safety Plan:
 
 
Should an emergency situation (such as an earthquake, chemical spill, power failure, civil disaster, or any other event that 
interrupts regular school activity) occur while school is in session, 

 
 
No student will be dismissed from school unless a parent (or individual previously designated by a parent) comes for 
him/her.
 
 
No student will be allowed to leave with another person unless that 

card in our files.
 
 

 
 
We do ask your help in the following areas:
 
 
Please DO NOT CALL THE SCHOOL. We must
 
have the lines open for emergency calls.
 
 
As soon as possible, come to school to pick up your child and any other children for whom you are the emergency card 
designee.
 
 
Park in designated parking spaces. Leave the driveway clear for emergency vehicles.
 
 
If, at the direction of public officials (fire, police, etc.), the children have been relocated to another site for safety, a
n 
announcement will be made on Bay Area radio stations and television. A public information line will also be maintained 
at the Dis
trict Office, (650) 637
-
4800, and the PTA will initiate a telephone tree.
 
 
Be sure you have told your student to follow the directions of school personnel.
 
 
If there is a need to evacuate, we would be at Ralston Middle School.
 
 
Emergency Procedures for Dis
aster
 
Evacuation Drill: Alarm will automatically be activated in each classroom with corresponding strobe lights. All students 
and staff will exit rooms to outside corridors and quickly walk to the blacktop area in single class lines. The teacher will 
imme
diately count all students to confirm the attendance and location of each student.

Earthquake: Alarm and/or paging system will alert all students and staff to exit and convene on the blacktop area. The 
drop, cover, and hold on exercise will be used in the
 
classrooms before exit. Emergency cards will be used to exit students 
from the campus. Emergency provisions are available in the emergency shed on the upper playground. Ten 50 gallon 
drums of purified water plus high calorie
-
dense "energy
-
bars" are availa
ble to sustain students up to 3 days.
