About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required
 
to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be
 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more inf
ormation about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the scho
ol principal or the 
district office.

Quality, 
Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Evergreen School District held a Public Hearing on October 10, 2010, and determined that each school within the district has 
sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and ins
tructional materials pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California.
 
 
All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects 
for use in 
the classroom and to take home. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the district must be aligned with the C
alifornia State 
Content Standards, with final approval by the Board of Trustees. Textbooks and supplementary materials are typicall
y adopted according to a cycle 
developed by the California Department of Education. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the qua
lity, currency, and 
availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional material
s used at the school. The district does not have a formal textbook adoption 
for Health or for Visual and Performing Arts.
 
 
The California State Board of Education adopted science programs at its November 2018 public meeting.  Evergreen will review 
material
s in 2019
-
20 to 
determine next steps.  The California State Board of Education adopted Social Science materials at its November 2017 public m
eeting aligned to the new 
California Framework.  The California Social Science standards remain unchanged.
 
 
Pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, a school district may utilize instructional materials not adopted b
y the SBE, so long as the 
materials are aligned to state standards and a majority of the participants of any review process conduct
ed by the district are classroom teachers who 
are assigned to the subject area or grade level of the materials being reviewed.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Carolyn Clark Elementary School, originally constructed in 2004, is currently comprised of 38 permanent classrooms, a library
, a cafeteria/multipurpose 
room, a staff lounge, and one playground. The dis
trict passed a facilities bond measure in 2006 that will allow for future modernization. As a result of 
this bond, three portable classrooms were added to the grounds in the summer of 2008. The chart displays the results of the m
ost recent facilities 
inspe
ction.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 
Carolyn Clark Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district has a
dopted cleaning standards 
for all schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a d
aily basis throughout the school year with emphasis on classrooms and 
restrooms. A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

staff to develop sanitation schedu
les that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair:
 

 
heavy maintenance 
functions occurring d
uring vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that school g
rounds 
and facilities remain in excellent repair.
 
A work order process is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. 
Emergency repairs are given the highest priority; repair requests are 
completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
The State School Deferred Maintenance Program provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
f
or
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures 
for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, 
and floor systems. In the Budget Act of July 2009, the State Legislature provided school districts with flexibility in 
using these funds to meet general fund needs. In an effort to mitigate the effects of declining state revenues, the Evergreen
 
School Dist
rict has taken 
advantage of this flexibility. The district will utilize bond funds and other appropriate sources to ensure its facilities ar
e clean, safe, and in good repair.

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is our primary con
cern at Carolyn Clark Elementary School. Students are supervised before and after school, during 
recess, and lunch by teachers, support staff, administrators, noon
-
duty supervisors, and parent volunteers. All visitors to the campus must sign in at the 
main
 
office and wear a visitor

s sticker at all times during their stay on school grounds. There is also a designated area for student drop
-
off and pick
-
up 
at the front of the school. The bus loop at the top of the school is designated for district and charter
 
buses, along with commercial vehicles for pickup to 
after school community programs (this area also has morning and after school supervision.) 
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan was reviewed and updated in November 2012 by the Emergency Response Team (ERT) and
 
is updated by the School Site 
Council yearly, most recently in the spring of 2019. A safety meeting was held on October 10th, 2018 immediately following In
ternational Walk to School 
Day. The purpose of the meeting was to share any updates to the plan and 
to gather input (focusing on component 1 & 2) to update the Comprehensive 
School Safety Plan from students, staff and community members. Anna Ly, a representative from the Department of Transportatio
ns (D.O.T) was present 
for part of the meeting. Others in
vited to the forum were ETA President, Brian Wheatley, CSEA President, Pauline Benton, Fire Chief, current president 
of our PTA, and student body president. It will be reviewed again this winter with a revision submission in 2020. Updates and
 
revisions to 
the plan will 
be communicated to both classified and certificated staff. Key elements of the Safety Plan focus on the following:

Staff members build teaching skills and concepts through participation in conferences and workshops throughout the year.  Sta
ff development occurred 
for the teachers on their second day 
back, as well as an in
-
service day on September 26, 2019, where the focus was on staff team building and Social 
Emotional Learning.  To support this day of professional development, we had our New Tech Coach working with the staff.  Our 
district has given 
the site 
days to the principals to hold professional development specific to the work at each site.  The focus continues to be on buil
ding a positive school culture, 
that entails a growth mindset and that of continuous improvement and respect among the sta
ff (the New Tech model).  Our school
-
wide focus this year 
revolves around Relationship Building, Social Emotional Health & Learning, and English Language Learners.  Along with our sch
ool wide focus, improving 
our practice around projects and deeper learnin
g remains at the forefront.  On
-
going outside support is available for professional development around 
PBL.  We have a dedicated New Tech coach to support the specific needs of our school.  Our coach is scheduled to return for a
 
two day visit in the spring
 
of 2020 to lead a workshop at a staff meeting and following site day.  The workshop will focus on how we can better engage an
d meet the needs of our 
English Language Learners within our projects.  She will also conduct classroom visits in the form of Inst
ructional Rounds to give feedback on our practice.  
Building capacity among our teachers continues to be a focus.  We work closely with our New Tech coach to move our projects t
owards this "gold 
standard."  In looking at the New Tech model and Hierarchy of
 
Change, we are continuing to work on Instruction and Assessment.  Each grade
-
level on 
site has a majority of the teachers trained in project
-
based learning.  Site days, District PLC days and two staff meetings a month will be devoted to adult 
learning thr
ough protocols that are reflective in nature.  2019
-
2020 PLCs will focus on the growth and development of our English Language Learners.  
Teachers worked with their grade level teams to create their Inquiry Question to drive their work.  Norms and agreemen
ts were created by each team 
and teams meet regularly during designated District PLC days throughout the year.  The staff will start a book study on socia
l emotional health (The 
Whole
-
Brain Child, by Tina Bryson) during monthly staff meetings.  The Princip
al will continue to set the conditions to foster this work through on
-
going

time, as well as providing the resources needed to be successful.
