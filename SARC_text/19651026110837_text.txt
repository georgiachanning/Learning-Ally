By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description
 
 
Hillview Middle School is located in the southwest portion of the Antelope Valley in the community of Palmdale.  Westside 
Union School District, covering approximately 360 square miles of high desert of California, is located in the southwest 
portion of the Antelope Valley in the community of Palmdale.  Westside Union School District has an enrollment of 
approximately 9600 students from Kindergarten through 8th grade.
 
 
Hillview was built in 1993 and serves students from the surrounding communit
ies of west Palmdale and west Lancaster. 
Hillview has approximately 987 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students. Students from four elementary schools feed into Hillview. 
In addition, Hillview currently has approximately 420 students in attendance on transfers fr
om inside or outside of the 
District boundaries. The school buildings consist of one main building composed of 18 regular classrooms, two science 
labs, a library, a home economics room, an art room, a wood
-
shop room, a technology lab, a computer lab, and a
 
cafeteria. 

offices. In addition, there are 16 relocatable classrooms (which includes two computer labs), a music/band room, and a 
gymna

equipment and a patio with picnic tables.
 
 
Sixth grade students who attend Hillview participate in the 6th grade Honors Academy. These students
 
are selected from 
a lottery after meeting the requirements which include: 1) 3.0 GPA or higher each semester during 4th and 5th grade with 
no D or F grades or students on a Standards Based report card must have 3 and 4 scores (Standard Met or Standard 
Exc
eeded) each semester during 4th and 5th grade. 2) Meets or Exceeds Standards on 4th grade ELA & Math State Tests.  
3) An average of 10 or fewer absences when looking at both 4th and 5th grade. These students are exposed to a rigorous 
curriculum, STEM elect
ive classes, and are eligible to participate in all middle school activities. Hillview also has a program 
to work with the district's middle school functional skills students. These special needs students are served in four differe
nt 
classrooms of about te
n students each; however, many work with our elective and PE programs and interact with and 
work with our general education 6th, 7th, and 8th graders. Our special needs students have the opportunity to participate 
in a reverse inclusion PE class and an inc
lusion sports league.
 
 
Hillview offers a strong core curriculum. Most curricular classes have numerous offerings including support classes and 
advanced classes. Our entire school is networked, and wired and wireless internet access is available across the 
campus. 
Classrooms have smartboards and document cameras, and sets of Chromebooks.  Chromebook carts are also available for 
teachers to check out for classes like PE or electives that may not have a set in their room.  A high emphasis is placed on 
an educa
tion that provides for every student to become skilled in the use of technology, computers, and industrial 
technology. Students have the opportunity to participate in numerous elective classes including computers, design and 
modeling, band, art, industrial
 
arts (wood shop), flight and space, Vex robotics, Lego Robotics, AVID, Model UN, and home 
economics. Numerous clubs, academic teams, tutoring programs, and interscholastic sports provide opportunities for 
students to participate and interact with each oth
er outside of the regular school day.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Hillview Middle School provides a safe, secure, 
comfortable and clean environment for learning.  We are committed to 
the health and safety of our students, staff and volunteers. To help maintain a closed campus, students and visitors are 
signed in and out through the office during school hours.  The hal
ls and playground are monitored by classified and 
certificated staff.  The intercom and site radios are used as an aid to communicate with staff members and students.  
Designated bells provide alerts for students and staff members.
 
 
Westside School Distric
t participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which assists school districts 
with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components.  Currently there are no 
deferred maintenance projects scheduled for Hi
llview Middle School. Installed new HVAC and roofs for the permanent 
building in 2010.
 
 
A team of custodians ensures that all classrooms and facilities are clean, safe and in good working order.  The district has 
developed a cleaning process that is utiliz
ed by the school ensuring uniform procedures.  A work order process is used to 
provide efficient service and ensure that emergency repairs are given the highest priory.  At the time the report was 
published, 100 percent of restrooms on campus were in good 
working order.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
A range of academic and social 
emotional supports exist for Westside students, many of which are unique to individual 
school sites, tailored to meet the needs of the members of each school community.  Many of these supports are provided 
by counselors (district and/or community
-
based), s
chool psychologists, school nurses, specialists in 
Speech/Language/Hearing, adaptive physical education teachers, or behavior specialists.
 
 
Student Study and Child Study Teams assist students experiencing academic and/or social emotional challenges, those 
with special needs, and with assessing eligibility for placement in special classes and/or recommending specialized services 
as needed. Special services and classes are offered for students with learning disabilities as well as other students with 
exceptio
nal needs.
 
 
Twelve counselors provide a range of support services for Westside students.  Programs and services are developed and 
provided based on student data (such as referrals for threatening or self
-
harm behaviors and academic intervention 
letters) an
d the needs of the school site.  Often these programs build upon the skills and habits of mind that are nurtured 
and developed in Leadership Development through Physical Education (LDTPE), AVID, and Boys Town.  Examples of 
counseling programs include speci
fic groups for strong
-
willed students, grief groups, groups for students who are 
exhibiting signs and behaviors due to trauma, academic organization groups (addressing academic organization of 
assignments, goals, and expectations), and community outreach a
nd service clubs such as Student Ambassadors or 
Kindness Club. School counselors are assisted by a cadre of Campus Climate Assistants, highly trained paraprofessionals 
who provide social emotional support and structure for students during more unstructured
 
parts of the school day like 
recess and lunch. Counselors and Educational Service staff members collaborate regularly with community agencies to 
facilitate alignment and coordination of resources and supports for students and their families.
 
 
The district
 
continues to collaborate with the Department of Mental Health to coordinate with local mental health 
agencies to provide School Based Mental Health services at all school sites for eligible students.
 
 
Behavior specialists provide student and staff support
 
for students needing intensive behavior support and/or 
intervention.
 
 
Bilingual paraprofessional support staff provide assistance in the classroom for English Learners. Bilingual assistants 
receive ongoing professional development in the areas of strategi
es to support students learning English within the 
classroom; review of district wide academic programs supporting English Learners; specialized language practice used for 
translation during parent/teacher conferences; protocols for English Learner identif
ication; and criteria for student 
reclassification.
 
 
Several programs, designed to build students' emotional intelligence and capacity and to promote positive and proactive 
social decision making, reduce bullying, and build an inclusive culture continue to
 
be implemented districtwide. Two of 
these are BoysTown (implemented in grades Kindergarten through 8) and Leadership Development through Physical 
Education for students in grades 4, 5, and 6.
 
 
A variety of online mathematics (i.e. Big Brains and ALEKS) an
d reading intervention (i.e. FastForWord) programs are 
accessible for students.  In addition to being used during the school day, students can also access these programs from 
home.  These online interventions are site
-
specific.

A variety of extended learn
ing opportunities like before/after school tutoring and/or lunchtime Learning Lab support were 
offered at all sites.  Learning Labs provide support with homework and opportunities for collaborative learning sessions.  
Tutoring may provide review of foundat
ional skills, frontloading of key skills and concepts, and/or homework assistance.  
Five days of intersession support is provided for middle school students during each spring and summer intersession.  An 
Extended School Year program is available during th
e first part of summer intersession for those students with disabilities 
who qualify.  A traditional district wide summer school program was on hold for the summer of 2018 due to significant 
maintenance and repairs at school sites. In lieu of the summer sc
hool program for elementary students, optional 
interactive Summer Learning Kits were purchased for parents and caregivers to use with their students over the summer 
intersession. The Kits contained games, tools, and materials to sharpen and support reading
, writing, and math skills.  
Additionally, the district offered its third summer KinderCamp during the summer.  The three
-
day experience was designed 
to provide an opportunity for incoming Kindergarteners and their parents to learn about Kindergarten expec
tations in a 
day camp
-
type environment.

district has developed a robust system for new teacher support including 1:1 support, Professional Learning Communities 
(PLCs), and
 
direct classroom support. New teachers are assigned a mentor/coach dependent upon their credential status. 
Support providers, mentors, and coaches in the program are veteran teachers who have been released full
-
time from their 
classroom responsibilities. 
 
Every new teacher is supported weekly at their site by their mentor/coach with the focus of 
support being aligned to their goal and individual support plan.  Full time administrators/coaches also support the pre
-
interns and interns based upon the requirem
ents of their university's memorandum of understanding and the 
requirements of the CTC.  The pre
-
intern and intern teachers participate in biweekly professional development based 
upon the district initiatives as well as their unique developmental needs.  T
eachers holding a Preliminary credential are 
supported by teachers on special assignment who serve as full time Support Providers.  Those holding a Preliminary 
credential attend a series of six professional development opportunities specially designed and 
aligned with the California 
Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTPs). For veteran teachers needing additional support, the Peer Assistance and 
Review (PAR) program is designed to improve the education of students by providing opportunities for additio
nal training 
for all teachers.
