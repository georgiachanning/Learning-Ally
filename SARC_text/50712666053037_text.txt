 School Accountability Report Card
 Reported Using Data from the 2018
-19 School Year
 Published During 2019
-20   By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
   For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.  For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.  For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
  DataQuest
 DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).  Internet Access
 Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-come, first
-served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Mission:
 
To empower every student to achieve their personal best we endeavor to maintain a strong and active partnership 
between family, school, and community. We provide a safe and supportive learning environment, and we 
have high 
expectations of staff, families, and students and of our community.
 
 
We hold firm to the belief that all students can learn at high levels. Teachers, administrators and staff are committed to 
the continuous improvement of classroom 
instruction and intervention practices to advance student performance. Our 
culture builds the capacity of teachers, staff, students and administrators by fully implementing the District's Four Pillars
 
of professional practice as they relate to pedagogy, le
adership, and organization. These pillars are 1) High Expectations 
for All, 2) Standards
-
Aligned Differentiated Instruction, 3) Professional Collaboration and Accountability, and 4) Safe 
Climate and Strong Relationships.
 
 
School Description:
 
Salida Element
ary School was the first school in our district; it was the only school serving Salida's children for many years. 
Since its foundation the site has served as a K
-
8 school, a middle school, and presently it is an elementary school serving 
students in grades
 
TK
-
5.  We are situated in the heart of Salida, an unincorporated community in Stanislaus County and 
part of the greater Modesto metropolitan area.  During the 1980's and 1990's Salida grew as a bedroom community that 
offered affordable housing to commuter
s from the Bay Area.  The housing boom provided students and funding for four 
additional schools in our district and Salida Elementary now serves the older and less affluent section of our town. The 
Salida Community is diverse and our school reflects this.
 
We embrace a rich and culturally diverse atmosphere, and we 
work to create a caring and cohesive learning environment for students and their families.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Impro
vements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Each year our central maintenance department assesses the site's needs and the District prioritizes funding to ensure 
safety, cleanliness and adequate facilities.  The most recent major improvements were made during the summer 
of 2019 
and they are as follows:  exterior paint throughout, library remodel with new furniture, safety fencing installed, all 
classroom windows replaced, new carpet and counter tops in classrooms,
 
 
Salida Elementary is a well
-
maintained and 
well
-
utilized site. The full
-
time lead custodian works with a night custodian 
who cleans and maintains the facilities daily. The district maintenance team repairs and maintains the grounds and 
supports the site custodians with major projects. As an example
, our student bathrooms are now equipped with fixtures 
that utilize a sensor; both to avoid spread of bacteria and to conserve water.  The damaged ceiling tiles in all of our porta
ble 
classrooms and some of our permanent classrooms were replaced in the sum
mer of 2014, and the playground area and 
its equipment is regularly updated by the Headstart and Pre
-
School programs.
 
 
In September of each year, since 2013,  the Stanislaus County Office of Education has assigned a facilities inspector to 
ensure complianc
e with the Williams Act and we passed all aspects of the inspection and were commended for the 
excellent upkeep our our facilities.  Our most current inspection was carried out in August of 2019; and we again passes 
all aspects of the inspection with comme
ndations for the excellent upkeep of the facilities; future facilities (Williams) 
inspections have been waived.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our Safety Committee revises and updates the site's Safe School Plan each fall.  Staff review the updates and then the SSC 
reviews and approves the plan.  The plan focuses on supporting student learning by providing a safe environment, teaching 
students st
rategies for solving social conflicts, determining ways to address student emotional concerns, and making 
healthy life choices.
 
 
Our parent and student surveys ask families to rate our school's safety.  Using the results of parent, teacher, and district 
He
althy Kids Surveys, we determine the effectiveness of our safety programs and the needs of our students. With this 
input, we implement site procedures; address needed physical site improvements, and modify our programs. Each student 
has access to a parent/
student handbook at the beginning of the year, explaining procedures and academic and behavior 
expectations.

learning opportunities and a safe setting when parents are unable to provide these.  And we practice emergency 
procedure drills on a monthly basis to ensure that students and staff have a clea
r plan of action in case of an emergency 
situation.

Salida 
Elementary staff is dedicated to providing an excellent education to all students. We provided balanced, 
comprehensive core curriculum to all students by using the state
-
adopted Benchmark Advance for ELA,  Eureka 
Mathematics, Delta Education Foss Science, 
Scott Foresman Social Studies curriculum.  Our students in grades TK through5 
also receive instruction in Music and Physical Education.
 
 
English Language Arts is a priority and we strive for continuous improvement by maximizing the use of state
-
adopted, 
re
search based programs; participation in training, workshops, data analysis, and the use of community resources. Salida 
Elementary teachers have received training on the implementation of iReady, a supplemental program, and the use of its 
data options to dr
ive interventions.  Teachers in our District have been trained on the implementation of Close Reading 
strategies and they work collaboratively to design writing lessons that are aligned with CCSS writing standards, and 
developing lessons for our Language A
rts program (Benchmark). Using categorical funds we have developed and 
implemented a learning center model; the LC  staff in conjunction with classroom teachers plan strategic interventions 
utilizing the named programs, to differentiate Language Arts/Readi
ng instruction at every grade level.  Strategic 
interventions for English Learners also include an after
-
school program offered by Migrant Education, for migrant
-
eligible 
students in first through fifth grades; approximately 37 students. Migrant Ed also fu
nds 30 hours of in
-
school tutoring for 
the same students.  One tutor is assigned to Salida Elementary and the hours are spread among all grade levels.  Students 
receive small and whole group vocabulary instruction in their classrooms to support development
 
of listening and speaking 
skills.  Every English Learner receives instruction by a credentialed teacher certified to differentiate instruction to suppo
rt 
English Language Development as well as additional support utilizing computer programs, or our interv
ention by our 
Learning Center staff.

The Foss inquiry
-

Staff participated in a 3
-
day Foss training during the first year that we implemented this hands on 
program. Teachers keep 
current on their own science knowledge through courses and ongoing training. For eight years, we worked with retired 
Modesto Junior College professor, Lynn Hansen, through the TOPS (Teaching Opportunities for Partners in Science) 
pro
gram. Some of the activities they brought to us include: first graders dissecting squid; second graders experimenting 
with force and gravity; third graders exploring secret formulas; fourth graders building watershed models; and fifth 
graders creating anem
ometers and barometers. While Professor Hansen is no longer able to teach the classes, our 
teachers continue to teach these units to their students.
 
 
Technology is an integral component of  teaching and learning at Salida Elementary.  Every student and tea
cher on campus 
has a computer or device assigned to them.  Our Media Tech updates and maintains learning programs, website links, and 
hardware so that it is available to support teachers and students.  Our media tech and our library clerk assist teachers i
n 
utilizing technology for interventions: including iRedy and Zearn.  Students access their individual profile with a user 
account anywhere on campus to use application software for word processing, multimedia, keyboarding, publishing, and 
internet researc
h.Teachers have a laptop computer for managing classroom data, planning lessons, accessing the internet 
and email, and executing presentations.   Teachers in grades second through fifth received instructional technology; 
including a smart board, projector 
and laptop to facilitate, high
-
tech, interactive learning opportunities for all students.  
Students in grades first through fifth have access to individual devices (Chromebook) in their classrooms.  A digital camera 
in each grade level is used for many pro
jects including; recording the life cycle of a butterfly in first grade, symmetrical 
portraits by second graders, a third grade musical iMovie tied to science and literature, and an environmental science 
presentation by fourth graders. The site technology 
plan is updated to ensure integrated, project
-
based, standards
-
driven 
student learning.  Our district provides instructional support to our teachers; a District Technology lead models using 
technology as part of every day instructions, offers courses on sp
ecific educational programs, and supports the site 
technology leads in connecting technology to curriculum. The library is organized by the Dewey Decimal System and AR 
level for quick access by all students. Students can find lists of AR books on the schoo
l website and at the local county 
library.

Salida Union School District is committed to dedicated professional development which is aligned to the district's 
Instructional Focus plan.  The goals are: to ensure each student is proficient in all academic standards and able to 
participate fully in the
 
21st Century; to accelerate language proficiency for English learners; and to close the "achievement 
gap" among students in subgroups and maximize learning for all students.
 
 
To do this, professional development equips administrators, teachers, para
-
profe
ssionals, and after
-
school program staff 
with the necessary skills and knowledge to meet these endeavors.  Professional development is based on assessed needs 
with teacher and staff input.  Training topics are selected based on their proven effectiveness, 
basis in sound research 
practices, and sustainability over time.  Training is provided through sub release days, Thursday minimum day release, 
pre
-
service work days and summer institute.
 
 
Professional development over the next three years will focus on:
 
1.
 
Im
plementation of California Common Core State Standards to ensure all students are college
-
 
and career
-
ready.
 
2.
 
Creating exceptional learning environments that equitably support and appropriately challenge all students.
 
3.
 
Ensuring classroom instruction is effec
tive and engaging.
 
4.
 
Targeted instruction based on data to meet individual student needs to utilize integrated technology within a 
blended
 
1.
 
learning environment.
 
5.
 
Closing the achievement gap among White, Hispanic, African American, Students with 
Disabilities, English learners 
and English
 
2.
 
only students.
 
6.
 
Fostering and supporting collegiality that leads to an environment of collaboration and shared responsibility for 
student learning.
 
7.
 
Integrating social/emotional learning for students by implementing
 
PBIS.
 
8.
 
Establishing positive behavioral supports needed to ensure all students social, emotional and academic success.
 
 
To aide classroom teachers in differentiating instruction for English Learners, each staff member is provided with an 
academic profile f
or each EL student assigned to his/her class. During teacher in
-
service sessions that are designated for 

progress. The Learning Cente
r Teacher and Principal will meet each trimester to analyze EL student progress; results will 
be shared with the classroom teachers. To aide in addressing the needs of English learners, all Salida School District 
teachers are responsible for obtaining a CL
AD credential or its equivalent. Currently 100% of teachers at Salida Elementary 
hold their CLAD credential or its equivalent. Salida Union School District is presently in Program Improvement and has 
reserved funds for staff development accordingly, for Di
strict and site Staff.
 
 
Second 
-
 
fifth grade teachers participate in three i
-
Ready workshops to improve implementation of the program and its 
use to differentiate student learning. Grade level teams use the Achievement Team Protocol to monitor student prog
ress 
in math using common formative assessments (i.e. embedded ENY module assessments). And site administrators 
participate in professional development focused on identifying good first instructional practices, observations protocols, 
and effective teacher
 
feedback.  Training is facilitated by Stanislaus County Office of Education math coaches.
 
 
School staff also receives annual training as required by the district.  (Bloodborne Pathogens, Sexual Harassment, 
Playground Safety, First Aide, Confidentiality, B
ullying, Fire Safety, Earthquake Safety, etc.)
