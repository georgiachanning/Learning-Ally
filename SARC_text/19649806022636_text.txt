About the 
SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local 
Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to ad
dress state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or the district off

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Webster school was built in 1949. Two major reconstruction projects in the past 20 years have resulted in all new plumbing, h
eating, electrical, and 
roofing systems. Major improvements in seismic safet
y and accessibility are in place. All classrooms, the office, and the library are connected to the 
Internet through a high
-
speed connection and there is wireless access to the network throughout the school. The most recent taxpayer
-
funded 
reconstruction pr
oject, Proposition BB, has provided a significantly upgraded technology infrastructure and a completely new fire alarm system
. 
Additional Proposition BB
-
funded projects related to school safety and security are in the final stages of the planning process, 
and the first of several 
construction phases is about to begin. A new library was completed in 2001. The playground includes two grass playfields and 
a play structure. Students 
are regularly expected to assist school and district staff in keeping the groun
ds free of litter.
 
 
Gardens and murals make the campus an especially beautiful and welcoming learning environment. The physical plant is well mai
ntained and is in well
-
functioning condition. Each of our 13 classroom teachers has a dedicated classroom. Ever
y classroom has an interactive white board and a SMART Board, 
an Elmo document camera, and every classroom from first through fifth grade has a chromebook for each student, allowing for a
 
one to one technology 
program. Our library is beautiful and spacious
. Our computer lab provides 34 iMac desktop computers, all online. There is a classroom provided for our 
after
-
school childcare program so no regular classrooms have to be shared for this purpose. There are many outside garden areas and
 
patios regularly 
us
ed for small group activities and special projects and events. Our cafeteria/auditorium was recently remodeled with a new sta
ge curtain, sound system, 
and lighting.
 
 
2018 saw the completion of the new window paint and floor project. We also were able to do
 
roof section repairs. (Carey insert here)

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

50 volunteers working in the classrooms on any given day.  Parents raise significant sums of money to fund materials that sup
port our district 
programs. As a collective group, our PT
A supports the purchase of technology, online academic programs, assemblies, field trips, classroom materials 
and after school programs such a Math Club and reading Club. More than 100 parents work every week as volunteer classroom ass
istants. Parents and 
community members contribute their talents, knowledge, and experience as classroom speakers. Parents organize and participate
 
with their children in 
a variety of community

service learning projects. Parents help to supervise the playground and direct traff

coordinated through the Webster PTA.

r campus. School grounds are 
open 20 minutes before school begins. Traffic, parking, and drop
-
off procedures have been developed in
 
consultation with local law enforcement and 
the Webster PTA. Parent volunteers direct traffic and assist students as they are dropped off by parents. During the school d
ay, all recesses are supervised 
by teachers and other school staff, as well as parent 
volunteers and Pepperdine University students in various programs.
 
 
Parents and guardians must sign students out of the office if they are picking them up during the school day. Physical educat
ion teachers, office staff, 
and teachers receive training in va
rious areas related to student safety, including first aid and CPR. After school, all students are required to be enrolled 
in supervised programs if they remain at school, such as child care, homework club, and school
-
sponsored enrichment classes. During t
he school day, 
there is no unauthorized access to the school campus. All visitors must enter through the main office, sign in, and get a vis

on campus. Students are only released to parents or their designees.
 
 
The School Site 
Council annually reviews all aspects of school safety and security and makes recommendations based on the findings. District 
support is 
sought to implement any recommended changes or improvements. The School Safety Plan was last reviewed, updated, and disc
ussed with the school 
faculty in August 2018.

school sites and the 
collection of input from teachers and administrators. Among the primary focus areas for professional develop
ment in SMMUSD are the following:
 

 
Schoolwide focus on writing and communication
 

 
Training in Write From the Beginning and Beyond
 

 
Ongoing development of Professional Learning Communities
 

 
Focus on California State Standards for ELA and Math and Next Generatio

Using data to improve classroom instruction
 

 
Supporting students with special needs
 

 
Differentiated
 
instruction for all students, including English Learners
 
 
A variety of methodologies are used to provide professional development, including coaching and mentoring. SMMUSD provides co

several programs such as BTSA, National Boards, literacy and ELD coaching, Instructional Leadership Teams, and such 
specialized programs as Cotsen 
Fellows and Math Coaches. Additionally, professional development occurs through workshop series during banked time and/or aft

Types of Services Funded
 
A combination of state and federal funding is used to cover all aspects of our instructional program.
 
 
SMMUSD uses Title II funds to support a Math and 
Secondary Support Coordinator to:
 

 
work with teachers/administrators to support student learning around math content and practices for all students
 

 
facilitate and review the guaranteed and viable curriculum that includes use of common formative assessments
