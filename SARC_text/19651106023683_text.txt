By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

materials aligned with the St
ate Standards. Currently, all teachers in grades K
-
8 have access to math curriculum that 
supports teaching the CA Common Core Math Standards.  Elementary grades use Eureka Math curriculum, which includes 

tions, while Middle School is using College Preparatory Math (CPM). 

Reading and Writing Units of Study to support reading and writing instr
uction for all teachers in grades K
-
8. The Reading 
and Writing Units of Study are aligned to the standrads and were designed to match the rigor of the new CA Reading and 
Writing Common Core Standards. The District also purchased classroom libraries for eac
h grade level to support the 
diverse reading abilities in each classroom. Curriculum was purchased to ensure students acquire the foundational reading 
skills needed for early literacy skills. Phonics, Spelling, & Word Study System by Fountas & Pinnell was 
purchased for grades 
K
-
3 to help students attend to, learn about, and efficiently use sounds, letters, and words. In addition, Classroom Shared 
Reading materials by Fountas & Pinnell were purchased for grades K
-
2 to help build a strong early reading founda
tion. A 
process is in place for schools to order materials at the beginning of each school year for all students. In addition, there 
is 
a process to order additional materials throughout the year to address the changing needs of a schools student populatio
n, 

classes so appropriate materials can be ordered.  Our school complies with the Williams Law; every child has an 
appropriate textboo
k for all academic subjects requiring textbooks. Students are allowed to take textbooks home  to study 
after school when needed. The school uses district and categorical funds to provide supplemental materials for classrooms 
including classroom library boo
ks, as well as materials for intervention and ELD. Finally, WCSD has an established a 
thorough process for examining new instructional materials as they become available. With the full implementation of 
the California State Standards, the District will use
 
the process to examine, explore, pilot and adopt new curriculum 
materials aligned with the CCSS, with input and feedback from teachers, administrators and parents. Based on the 
recommendation from the Department of Education, WCSD plans to carefully exami

to ensure that the most appropriate materials are identified for our students.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Lydia Jackson Elementary School offers a safe and secure campus where students, staff and visitors are free from harm.  
The school's exterior was painted during the 2015 summer which enhanced the 
school's appearance.  The school is fully 
air conditioned and provides up
-
to
-
date facilities and adequate space for students and staff. Jackson Elementary is 
comprised of a kindergarten area, library, a multipurpose room and 25 classrooms. The school also 
enjoys a spacious 
playground with a playground apparatus, as well as grassy fields for running, sports and games. In the evenings and during 
the day, a team of 2 custodians ensures that classrooms, restrooms and campus grounds are kept clean and safe. A 
sc
heduled maintenance program is administered by the Whittier City School District to ensure that all classrooms and 
facilities are maintained appropriately. Jackson has been inspected to insure that the school complies with the William's 
requirements.
 
 
Lydi
a Jackson is well maintained by our two custodians and the WCSD maintenance department.  Our students and 
teachers support our campus cleanliness and safety.  A staff member represents our school on the district safety 
committee and she reports any campus 
safety concerns that have been reported to her.  The custodians and staff also 
alert the office staff of any areas that need to be maintained by the district maintenance department.

includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school is committed to providing students with a safe environment on regular days as well as days when emergencies 
occur. We have regular fire, earthquake, and lock down drills. These drills help our staff and students prepare for any 
emergency situati
on. On campus we have an emergency container with supplies for all students for approximately 3 days.  
We update our School's Comprehensive Safety Plan yearly and seek the input of local agencies (Whittier Police
 
Department and Whittier Fire Station) on ou
r plan.
 
 
As part of our commitment to safety we have implemented a Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports system.  The 
Staff has developed a behavior matrix that identifies the expected behavior across the school.  All teachers have made a 
commitment 
to directly teach the expected behaviors.  A greater emphasis is placed on rewarding students for positive 
behavior.  Our students are encouraged and reminded of our four guiding principles to work towards at all times

The School Safety Plan is updated and reviewed by both the certificated and classified 
staff on a yearly basis.  It may have 
additional modifications if the need arises.
 
 
At every staff meeting, the staff addresses safety concerns.
 
 
Our earthquake bin contains necessities such as blankets, flashlights, water, and food items. An inventory of 
the bin is 
completed yearly.  In our earthquake bin, every classroom has a supply of earthquake kits for their students.  Every 
classroom has a lock down bucket that contains needed supplies and materials in the event a lock down takes place and 
the studen
ts must remain in their classrooms for a period of time.
 
 
Jackson School is committed to the safety and security of each student. To maintain these conditions which contribute to 
the best possible learning environment, the School Safety Plan includes the f
ollowing elements:
 
 
1.
 
School Crime Assessment: Jackson School provides compiled school crime information each month for the 
California Safe School Assessment as mandated by the State of California. This information is analyzed at each 
school site to determin
e what steps may be taken to reduce incidents of crime.
 
 
2.
 
Child Abuse Reporting: Teachers and other school employees are required by law to report any cases of suspected 
child abuse or child neglect. Reports are investigated by the Department of Social Serv
ices to determine if any 
follow
-
up on the report is necessary.

3.
 
Disaster Procedures: In order to ensure the safety of students and school personnel, the school safety committee 
has created a comprehensive Disaster Preparedness Plan. Emergency drills are he
ld once a month and evaluated 
for effectiveness.
 
 
4.
 
Procedures to Notify Teachers of Dangerous Pupils: If a student is deemed dangerous because of behavior at 
school or behavior outside of school which has been dealt with by county juvenile authorities, the 
teacher(s) of 
the student will be promptly notified of the status of the student.
 
 
5.
 
Sexual Harassment Policy: Jackson School strictly adheres to district policies, which prohibit sexual harassment or 
discrimination of any kind. The sexual harassment policy 
is distributed to each student at the beginning of the 
school year, and employees are advised of their duty to take prompt action if they become aware of any incidents 
of sexual harassment.
 
 
6.
 
Student Release Procedures: Jackson School strictly follows our s
tudent release procedures, which includes 
releasing students only to individuals identified on students' emergency release cards and verifying these 
individuals by photo ID.
 
 
7.
 
Visitors and Volunteers:  All visitors and volunteers must report to the school o
ffice, sign in and sign out, and wear 
a pass for identification while on campus.  Parent volunteers need to complete an application and be approved 
prior to volunteering for school events or in the classroom.  The Meghan's Law website is accessed to ensure
 
all 
applicants are cleared.
 
 
8.
 
School Wide Dress Code: Jackson School believes that a clearly defined dress code contributes to a positive 
learning environment. Students at Jackson School follow the district dress code. The primary standards for student 
dre
ss and grooming include that the student should be neat and clean at school, and the student should not wear 
clothing that compromises safety, modesty, or disrupts school activities.
 
 
9.
 
Safe and Orderly Environment: Jackson School believes a safe and orderly
 
environment is necessary to ensure a 
positive learning experience for all students. Regular supervision of students is the core of creating and 
maintaining a safe and orderly environment. Teachers, aides, and the administrator consistently supervise and 
i
nteract with students to reinforce good behavior and safety standards. All students and teachers follow the school 
wide positive behavior intervention support matrix (PBIS).  A PBIS team meets monthly to review student 
discipline data to address areas or b
ehaviors that need to be addressed and monitored.
 
 
10.
 
The site custodians walk the campus daily and submit work orders as needed to ensure that the facilities are safe 
for our students.
 
 
In addition, Fire, Earthquake or Lockdown Drills are held monthly to 
ensure that all teachers and students can respond 
appropriately  to an emergency.
 
 
The safety plan was reviewed, updated and discussed with the faculty at the Opening Staff Meeting on August 12, 2019. 
We continuously revisit and update our school plan as w
e practice our drills throughout the year.
 
 
Finally, a strong partnership exists between our school and local law enforcement. Local law enforcement agencies provide 
ongoing support to the school and coordinates with school and district personnel to ensure
 
students safety in case of a 
campus or neighborhood threat.
