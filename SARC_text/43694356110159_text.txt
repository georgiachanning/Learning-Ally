About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Evergreen School District held a Public Hearing on October 10, 2010, and determined
 
that each school within the district has sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California.
 
 
All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standa
rds
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects 
for use in the classroom and to take home. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the district must be aligned
 
with the California State 
Content Standards, with fina
l approval by the Board of Trustees. Textbooks and supplementary materials are typically adopted according to a cycle 
developed by the California Department of Education. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the qua
lity, currenc
y, and 
availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. The district does not have a formal textbook adoption
 
for Health or for Visual and Performing Arts.
 
 
The California State Board of Education adopte
d science programs at its November 2018 public meeting.  Evergreen will review materials in 2019
-
20 to 
determine next steps.  The California State Board of Education adopted Social Science materials at its November 2017 public m
eeting aligned to the new 
Ca
lifornia Framework.  The California Social Science standards remain unchanged.
 
 
Pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, a school district may utilize instructional materials not adopted b
y the SBE, so long as the 
materials are 
aligned to state standards and a majority of the participants of any review process conducted by the district are classroom t
eachers who 
are assigned to the subject area or grade level of the materials being reviewed.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Chaboya Middle School, originally constructed in 1991, is currently comprised of 47 permanent classrooms, a computer lab, a l
ibrary, a staff lounge, a 
work room, a gymnasium, a weight room, a track, two soccer fields, two ba
seball diamonds, a blacktop area, and one playground. The school will be 
replacing the 20
-
year
-
old sound system in the gym. The chart displays the results of the most recent facilities inspection.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 
Chaboya Middle School provides a safe an
d clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district has adopted cleaning standards for all 
schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the school year with emphasis on
 
classrooms and restro
oms. 
A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Mainten
ance & Repair:
 

ntenance functions 
occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered 
by the district to ensure that school grounds and 
facilities remain in excellent repair. A work order process is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. Emerg
ency repairs are given the 
highest priority; repair requests are completed effici
ently and in the order in which they are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
The State School Deferred Maintenance Program provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures 
for major repair or repl
acement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electr
ical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. In the Budget Act of July 2009, the State Legislature provided sch
o
ol districts with flexibility in 
using these funds to meet general fund needs. In an effort to mitigate the effects of declining state revenues, the Evergreen
 
School District has taken 
advantage of this flexibility. The district will utilize bond funds and
 
other appropriate sources to ensure its facilities are clean, safe and in good repair.

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessme
nts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards,
 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the 
University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

not; however, the number of students tested is not

DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data to
ol located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regardin
g English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at publ
ic libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the h
ours of operation, the length 
of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation
, and the ability to print 
documents.
