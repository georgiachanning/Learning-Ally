By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
2019/10
 
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 12, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbo
oks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or b
oth, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home.
 
 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available
. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the 
district office prior 
to adoption.
 
 
The table displays information collected in August, 2019 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

In the 2017
-
2018 school year, the school site has planned 10 collaboration/early release days and 5 professional 
development days. In the 2018
-
2019 school year, the school site has again planned 10 collaboration/early release
 
days 
and 5 professional development days. Three of these professional development days are dedicated to unit planning under 
the guidance of Nicole Vagle, one is site specific needs, and the final day is a district wide instruction and technology 
summit pu
t on by Ceres Staff. Lastly, in the 2019
-
2020 school year, the school site has again planned 10 collaboration 
/early release days and 5 professional development days. 1 of these days will be run by Dr. Dominique Smith with a focus 
on restorative justice an
d Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports, another 1 of these days will be facilitated by District 
Instructional Coaches on the topic of learning targets and success criteria. In addition to that, Professional Development 
on Trauma informed practices w
ill be had.
 
 
Staff development is a critical component to teacher and student success, and Ceres Unified School District is dedicated 
to a variety of professional development opportunities for staff.  Every other Monday after school is dedicated to 
departm
ent and grade level meeting times, for teachers to collaborate, learn strategies, and develop action plans to meet 
identified student needs.
 
 
The district participates in CUSD Induction Program and other county and state approved formal training programs 
d
edicated to improving teacher quality.  In addition, the district fully supports classroom teachers with a cadre of full time
 
staff developer/coaches who can assist with the implementation of curriculum and strategies.
 
 
School sites must include a professi
onal development plan and budget in their school site plan.  Activities can include 
attendance at summer institutes, after school or Saturday workshops, teacher release days to attend conferences, and 
grade level or department release days for in depth pro
fessional development.  All professional development is aligned to 
the district strategic plan.  The goal of all professional development is to increase student achievement. Each school has a 
district coach assigned to the school site.  The coach works wit
h individual teachers, grade levels, as well as the entire 
staff.
