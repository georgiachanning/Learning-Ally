Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
El Rincon Elementary School provides TK through 5th grade edu
cation to a diverse commuinity of learners. Our mission is 

community. Our state
-
of
-
the
-
art science and makerspace labs support our goal of pr
oviding STEAM (Science, Technology, 
Engineering, Arts, & Math) education. STEAM education is an interdisciplinary approach where academic concepts are 
coupled with real world applications. Our continued emphasis on balanced literacy integrates a variety of
 
literacy 
modalities to guide students toward proficient and lifelong reading. 
 
 
Through STEAM education, we go beyond the California state standards to foster the potential of ALL children by accessing 
their innate curiosity and stimulating their imaginat
ions. At El Rincon we provide opportunities for inquiry, problem 
solving, exploration, and discovery of the natural world.
 
 
Our school community is also committed to expanding our focus beyond academic achievement alone. Our emphasis is 
on maintaining an e
nvironment that supports students as they develop the 5 core competencies of socially and 
emotionally skilled children:
 

 
Self
-
awareness
-
 
the ability to recognize and name personal emotions
 

 
Self Management
-
 
the ability to regulate emotions
 

 
Social awareness 

 
showing understanding and empathy for others
 

 
Good relationship skills
-
 
ability to form positive relationships, work together, and effectively deal with conflict
 

 
Responsible decision making
-
 
ability to make postive choices about personal and social 
behavior
 
We believe that through the mindful practices of collaboration and communication that are taught across all content 
areas, children will develop an appreciation for multiple perspectives and deepen their understanding of the world around 
them.

El Rincon is truly a 
community where parents, teachers, and students care for each other, and strive to build positive 
relationships that support academic and social growth. We encourage a productive partnership with all stakeholders to 
ensure our scholars can achieve their hi
ghest potential. There are a variety of opportunites to be involved across the 
campus, starting with the El Rincon PTA. The school year begins with a huge membership drive and the importance of the 
PTA is made clear to all. Each classroom has a room parent
 
to support the teacher, the classroom, and school wide 
activites. The room parent acts as the liason between the teacher and parents, and will facilitate volunteer opportunites 
for all who are able. The PTA holds monthly meetings, free familiy fun nights,
 
and hosts a book fair twice a year. Each 
week, a newsletter is sent home detailing all of the activities across campus. Information is provided about how to 
participate. Addtionally, the school website and classroom communication provides information rega
rding school wide 
activities. The PTA is truly a partnership at El Rincon, and through sub committies such as the Green Ambassador, School 
Safety, and the Inclusion Committiee, parents and leadership work together to continually improve our school.
 
 
In Apri
l we host a Multicultural Week to celebrate the diverse community of El RIncon. Each morning, we have cultural 
performances from the families, some of which include Ethiopia, India, Phillipines, Brasil. Thailand, and more. Each class 
will explore one count
ry and one night during the week, we host Multicultural Night and families and staff come together 
to eat different foods and learn about the diversity across our campus.

the safety plan includes two goals, Goal 1

are
 
trained for emergencies. Review lockdown procedures and ensure protocols are adhered to by all staff members. This 
includes: 1. Training of staff and emergency response teams during drills, 2. Review and revise lockdown procedures to 
ensure that all staff
 
and students are trained and aware of their roles.    Goal 2 

 
Social and Emotional Safety: Ensure that 
there are systems in place to provide necessary support and resources for all students in need. This includes: 1. develop, 
implement and assess school
-
wide SEL supports, 2. develop and implement ways to support Tier 2 students, and 3.  in 
order to best support the diverse learners on campus, the administrator, counselor, school psychologist and other support

Currently, our staff is focusing on developing a balanced literacy model for Language Arts instruction. As a campus with 
inclusion classrooms, we are emphasizing 
curriculum development and changing our instructional practice to meet the 
diverse needs of individual students. Out Teaching and Learning Partner works with teachers around the Readers and 
Writers Workshop model and supports teachers in their implementati
on. Our Leadership Team studies student 
achievement, analyzes needs, and identifies other areas for staff development.
 
 
These identified needs become the focus of professional development for the following year for an ongoing 
comprehensive staff developmen
t program. This program includes district
-
wide assistance to teachers around balanced 
literacy, Cognitiveiy Guided Instruction, supporting students with disabilities in the general education classroom, 
supporting ELD students, technology, and paraprofessio
nal training. New teachers have attended Los Angeles County 
workshops and the Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment program (BTSA) is provided by CCUSD.
