School Description
 
Oxford 
Elementary School is located on just one acre, and its small school size has created a tight
-
knit community where children feel cared for and supported, academically and emotionally. We 
have approximately 275 students, K
-
5, with two classes per grade level
.  Our talented staff is 
dedicated to the academic achievement, social and emotional growth, and general health of every 
child. In addition to a strong classroom curriculum, students have classes in PE, music, gardening, 
science, art, and enjoy a weekly li
brary visit. We strive to offer a well
-
rounded program for all of 
our students.  We are committed to recognizing and celebrating the diversity of our community by 
having multicultural assemblies, the Annual Martin Luther King Jr. Oratorical Event, class pl
ays, and 
more.
 
 
We have very strong parent and community involvement in our classrooms and throughout the 
school. Our active PTA sponsors community events and fundraisers such as the Harvest Fair, Winter 
Fair, Read
-
a
-
thon, Parent Fundraising Party, Raffle 
and Spring Dance, and Talent Show. Parent and 
community volunteers work in the classroom, garden, cafeteria, and schoolyard. There are other 
ways for parents/guardians to get involved, too.  We have an active ELAC (English Language 
Advisory Committee), as 
well as an SSC (School Site Council).
 
 
At Oxford, there is an intervention team, or RTI team, that meets weekly to look at the unique 
needs of every individual student in the school, academically and emotionally. We provide services 
to many students with h
elp from our special education teachers, literacy coach/teacher, math 
coach, speech pathologist, counselor, UC Berkeley tutors and mentors.  In addition to reading, 
writing and math intervention, the intervention team also discusses ways to build in academ
ic 
challenge opportunities for students who are at or above grade level.  Our after school program, 
LEARNS, serves up to two thirds of our school population, providing homework help in addition to 
various enrichment classes like cooking, chess, organized s
ports and drama.  Oxford holds bi
-
monthly community meetings, where we talk about the Toolbox and School Rules, have class 
performances and songs, and celebrate our community with Ally Awards!

About the SARC
 
By February
 
1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding 
Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and 
local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school
, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availabil
ity of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019

Williams legislation calls for the schools to have enough books in core classes for all students and asks districts to reveal
 
whether those books are 
presenting information outlined in the 
California content standards.  Textbook materials are adopted by the school board following a rotating adoption 
cycle for subject specific state adopted textbooks and instructional materials.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district administers a scheduled maintenance program to ensure that all classrooms 
and facilities are well maintained and in good repair. A work 
order process alerts district personnel of any maintenance needed to be performed and ensures that emergencies are given the 
highest priority.
 
 
Safety issues are the top priority for Maintenance
 
and Operations. District maintenance supervisors inspect school sites continually and complete repairs 
in a timely manner. They use a work order process to ensure an efficient, prioritized repair process. The district maintenanc
e staff has indicated that 
100% of all toilets on school grounds are in working order.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by 
the Office of Public School Construction.

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co

significant cognitive disabilities); and

Parents/caregivers are welc

Parents/caregivers also serve on the English Learner Advisory Committee and PTA, and represent our school on district advisor
y committees.  We
 
encourage parents/caregivers to volunteer in classrooms.  Volunteers can tutor and read with students, provide additional hom
ework assistance, and 
support the classroom teachers.  Parents/caregivers can volunteer on the schoolyard, office, cafeteria, scho
ol garden, and in science class.  They are 
welcome to attend all school performances and events including community meetings, and chaperone field trips.   Our involved 
parents/caregivers raise 
funds to support enrichment classes, classroom aide support, a 
counseling program, art classes, classroom supplies, school
-
wide events and more.  Our 
Office of Family Engagement and Equity provides parent/caregiver support and interaction that contributes to a wonderful part
nership between home 
and school, benefiting 
the children at Oxford Elementary. We encourage parents/caregivers who are interested in volunteering to notify the classroom
 
teacher or the principal.  Interested volunteers can also contact our Office of Family Engagement and Equity Specialist, Caro

School Safety Plan
 
Oxford Elementary School was constructed in 1966 and covers 1.29 acres. The campus was completely remodeled in the late 1990s
. Facilities include 15 
permanent classrooms, one library, two s
taff rooms, one multipurpose room, two teacher resource rooms, a counseling room, and a reading intervention 
room. The facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its classroom and playground space. We are currently sched
uled to move to 1221 
U
niversity Avenue, West Campus in the Fall of 2020 for an undetermined amount of time.
 
 
The safety of students and staff is our primary concern.  During lunch, recesses, and before
-
and
-
after school, staff members, administrators, and 
instructional aides sup
ervise students and school grounds to ensure an orderly, safe environment. The school is always fully compliant with all rule
s, 
laws, and regulations concerning state earthquake standards and hazardous materials. Earthquake and fire drills are held mont
hly
, and intruder drills are 
held at least twice a year.
 
 
We have an active Safety Committee at Oxford.  The Safety Committee is working to support our emergency preparedness by inven
torying the emergency 
bin, updating procedures and organizing a school
-
wide 
earthquake drill to be held in the Spring 2020.  The City of Berkeley Emergency has been involved 
in providing training to staff related to emergency planning and earthquake drills.
 
 
Safety procedures, including elements of our Comprehensive Safe 
School Plan, are reviewed with school and district staff at the start of each school year. 
The plan was last updated and reviewed with school staff in February 2020.
