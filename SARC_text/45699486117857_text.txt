Our Vision
 
C
olumbia School District schools are safe, well maintained, exciting, stimulating and success 
oriented. The level of pride and accomplishment is quite 
evident. Everyone has a high sense of 
responsibility, sense of good values, positive behavior, moral conscience. They hold themselves 
accountable for their actions and the choices they make. Adults are visible and accessible to 
students. Communication is o
pen, friendly, and caring. Students come prepared, eager to 
participate, and devoted to learning because they believe in themselves. Parents take an active role 

nd 
by collaboratively working with the school staff.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
The mission of our school district is to ensure learning for all 

 
no limits, no excuses.
 
 
School Profile
 
Mountain View Middle School is located at 675 Shasta View Drive in 
Redding, California in a semi
-
rural to rural area.  There are several subdivisions within the district boundaries that have 

college campuses located within our dist
rict, Shasta College, a two
-
year community college, and 
Simpson University, a private four
-
year college. We maintain a positive relationship with both 
schools and often have student teachers from Simpson.
 
 
Mountain View Middle School offers a setting for s
tudents that encourages academic excellence 
and traditional values. We work to maintain a safe, positive learning environment, and parents and 
community members are welcomed and encouraged to become an integral part of our learning 
community.
 
 
Our middle s
chool includes grades 5,6,7 and 8, and an enrollment of 312 students. We have thirteen 
regular classroom teachers, 1.5 P.E. teachers, 1 Special Day Class teacher, Resource Specialist 
teacher, and Music Teacher. We also share a Counselor (LCSW) and share on
e Speech Therapist.
 
 
Our students are housed in a combination of permanent and portable classrooms which are well 
maintained. Our portable buildings offer the same amenities to students and teachers as a 
permanent classroom.
 
 
We offer a variety of curricul
ar and extra
-
curricular activities for our students including, Link Crew, 
band, music, technology, yearbook, after
-

About the 
SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local 
Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to ad
dress 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information 
about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Columbia Elementary School District held a public hearing on September 11, 2018, and determined that
 
each school within the district had sufficient and 
good quality textbooks, instructional materials, and science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the Sta
te of California. All students, 
including English learners, are given their own
 
individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the 
classroom and to take home. Textbooks are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, m
aking the textbooks 
us
ed in the school the most current available, with the exception of 5th grade who did not adopt this year. Materials approved 
for use by the State are 
reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee compose
d of teachers and administrators. All 
recommended materials are available for parent examination at the District Office prior to adoption. This table displays info
rmation about the quality, 
currency, and availability of the standards

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priorit

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessme
nts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards,
 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the 
University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Our school enjoys positive support from our parents and community. We have an involved Mountain View Parent Club who provide 
activities for students 
and parents alike all during the scho
ol year.
 
 
Our School Site Council plays an active role in developing and reviewing curriculum as well as categorical programs/budgets. 
They conduct an annual

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relev
ant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Mountain View Middle Scho
ol. The school is always in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations 
pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The School Site Safety plan was reviewed and updated by the
 
School Site Council. All 
revisions were communicated 

and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year. Loc
kdown dr
ills are held as needed. 
Students are supervised before and after school, and during lunch and break periods by certificated and/or classified staff, 
as well as administration. 
There is a designated area for student drop off and pick up. Visitors must chec
k in at the main office for an identification badge and all staff have been 
directed to send visitors to the office if an adult is spotted on campus without a name tag. Substitutes wear ID badges.
 
 
The key elements in the plan include types of 
drills, expected behaviors, assignments for staff, and procedures for different scenarios (i.e. intruder on 
campus, earthquake, fire, natural/civic disaster and evacuation).
 
 
The plan includes who does what, where emergency supplies are and a detailed desc
ription of key staff duties and office staff responsibilities as well as 
procedure for releasing students, press releases and counseling needs, if any.
