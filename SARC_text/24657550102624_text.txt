School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority
: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parent involvement is strongly encouraged at Lorena Falasco Elementary. Parents are an important part of the team and 
are invited to visit and volunteer in classrooms. In addition, parents also participate in school activities and serve in clu
bs 
and on com
mittees. Working cooperatively with parents is the key to student success. Through parent training classes, 
School Site Council, ELAC and Parent Club, parents take an active role in the academic success of our students. Guest 
speakers, such as a Los Banos 
Police Department Gang Task Force officer, the District Nurse, a representative from Los 
Banos Junior High School, and mental health counselors from Merced County have been scheduled throughout the year 
at parent meetings.  Back to School Night in the fall
 
and Open House in the spring are wonderful opportunities for parents 

 
 
It is essential that parents attend Parent 
-
Teacher Conferences which are held at the end
 
of the first trimester each year. 
Parents are encouraged and welcome to attend our End of Trimester Awards Assemblies which are held 3 times per year 
and student performance assemblies such as the Winter Program, the Talent Show, and the Science Fair.  If
 
you would like 
more information on how to become involved in any of these activities or programs, you may call our principal, Laura 
Brady, 209

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
Lorena Falasco Elementary is committed to providing students with a safe learning environment. A School Safety 
Committee meets on a yearly basis to review safety issues and 
recommend improvements. Another way we obtain parent 
input on school safety is through a school survey, developed through ELAC and SSC and completed by parents. Our school 
campus is maintained by 4 custodians, as well as District grounds and maintenance cr
ews. The school is inspected on an 
ongoing basis for safety hazards and repairs are made as required.
 
 
The students and staff participate in maintaining a clean and safe environment by putting litter in its place and keeping 
the classrooms neat and hazard 
free. In addition, fire and disaster drills are held regularly. Lorena Falasco Elementary has 
a School Disaster Plan which is included in our District Safety Plan. The School Safety Plan is updated yearly and was 
updated and approved by the School Site Cou
ncil in November 2019.

In an effort to help all students gain academic success, Lorena Falasco Elementary School
 
offers several programs and 
supplemental services which are funded through categorical programs. A response to Intervention model is used with tier 
one support taking place in the classroom.  Before or after school intervention is identified to specifical
ly targeted 
students. Identified first graders reading below grade level are pulled for a reading intervention program offered by 
kindergarten teachers.  An Intervention Support Instructor facilitates a reading pullout intervention program to help 
students
 
performing below grade level in 2nd grade. Several computer based programs such as Imagine Reading, Imagine 
Math Facts, Accelerated Reader, Accelerated Math,  and Rosetta Stone are utilized in the computer lab and classrooms to 
support student academic ac
hievement. Grades 1
-
6 have 1 to 1 iPADs and utilize specific Apps focused on math and ELA.  
Parent education is offered throughout the year in the form of guest speakers at parent meetings, as well as an 8 week 
Parenting Partners class. An educational news
letter which focuses on helping students be successful in school is sent home 
monthly in Spanish and English.

The primary focus of professional development is 
determined by teacher and staff input as well as by looking at the 
student academic assessment data. This year, the staff has participated in professional development on math. The 
teachers attended a day and half of Professional Development provided by Mat
h Solutions the week prior to the start of 
school.
 
 
Certificated staff members participate in weekly grade level collaboration meetings in which teachers share instructional 
strategies and look at student data.  Six PLC or professional learning community m
eetings are held throughout the year.  
During these PLC meetings, two math coaches from Math Solutions offer staff development in teaching methodologies 
regarding the common core math standards.  In addition to the PLC meetings, both math coaches work with
 
first through 
sixth grade teachers in their classrooms offering support on common core math lessons.  Staff meetings are held 
approximately one time per month and specific time is allotted for professional development. Teachers are supported 
with implemen
tation of CCSS through in
-
class coaching by administration, teacher and principal meetings, and looking at 
student performance data.
