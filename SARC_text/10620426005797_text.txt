School Description
 
Burrel
 
Elementary School is a single rural school district which serves K
-
8 elementary. Although we 
experienced a change in Superintendents, we continue to keep our focus on supporting our 
students through their educational journey. Curriculum is focused on meet
ing common core state 
standards in English language arts, mathematics, social studies and science. The school supports 
cultural awareness on a daily basis through its diverse literature selections, parent involvement, 
and a strong emphasis on the importanc
e of individual differences.
 
 
During the 2018
-
19 school year, 119 K
-
8 grade students were enrolled at the school, with classes 
arranged on a traditional schedule.
 
 
The majority of our students are enrolled in our after
-
school program which provides a 
safe place 
to get homework support and participate in a variety of enrichment that includes activities in 
nutrition, academics and recreation.
 
 
During the 2019
-
20 school year, Burrel
 
plans to continue to provide our students with engaging 
lessons that utilize the 21st century skills of collaboration, creativity, critical thinking and problem
-
solving across all content areas of learning. Our small class sizes provide students with the 
support 
of small
-
group instruction opportunities. Our students will be prepared for their futures in college 
and career readiness.
 
 
Mission Statement:  Our Students will make a Better World.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is 
required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (
LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported i
n an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa
/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members shoul

During the 2019

20 school year, Burrel Union Elementary fully implemented our English as a Se
cond Language (ESL) classes for our parents and 
community members. Due to a variety of work schedules for our parents, we are offering several opportunities to access this c

:00pm. Burrel Union Elementary also offers monthly Coffee Hours/Hora de Cafe events 
to provide opportunities to meet and have coffee with the Superintendent. Burrel Union continues to benefit from our supporti
ve parents who are the 
link between effective c
lassroom instruction and ongoing student learning. The school has a strong base of parent volunteers who volunteer in 
classrooms, serve as chaperones on field trips, support raising funds for special projects, and serve on special committees. 
Parents are a
lso welcomed to 
join the Parent Teachers Club or be part of our School Site Council. The school also benefits from several community partners
hips, including Maddox 
Dairy, Sweet Haven Dairy, Ingleby Farms as well as other local business.
 
 
We have implemente
d Family Education Nights (two this year). We will be utilizing our Psychologist to provide education for parents in the area
s of Social 
Emotional development and Positive Parenting. Class will be held in the evenings.

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Burr

pertaining to hazardous

material and state earthquake standards. The School Site Safety plan is reviewed annually and was last reviewed and updated 
in October 2019
, by school administration and our Safety Committee. All revisions were communicated to both the classified and certificated 
staff. The 

-
preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and dis
aster drills are conducted on a 
monthly basis throughout the school year. Lockdown drills are held twice a year and encompass all the elements required by ou
r Safe School Plan. 
Students are supervised before and after school by certificated staff, classifi
ed staff and the principal. Classified staff members supervise students during 
lunch. There is a designated area for student drop
-
off and pickup. Visitors are admitted through a locked front gate and must register in the office.
 
 
Our Safety Plan was also r
eviewed and approved by our School Site Council and English Language Advisory Committee on February 5, 2020.
 
 
Burrel Union Elementary has achieved the Gold Level of the Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS). Students at
