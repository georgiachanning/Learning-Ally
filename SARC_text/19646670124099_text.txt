School Description
 
Discovery Elementary School is a TK
-
5 comprehensive school that also houses three SDC classes.  
The goal of Discovery Elementary is to educate the whole child by providing access to rigorous core 
and supplemental content material.  Students are given multi
ple opportunities to learn at the level 
and time they need while using the 4 Cs: Critical Thinking, Communication, Collaboration, and 
Creativity.   Our TK
-
5 school has a spcial focus on the areas of science, technology, engineering, 
arts, and math (STEAM),
 
which will offer students a range of unique, exciting experiences and 
opportunities.
 
 
Discovery's Mission says:  "We will prepare all of our students for college and life by providing a 
challenging and engaging curriculum.  Through hands
-
on authentic exer
cises such as STEAM 
(RIGOR), we will promote Critical Thinking, Communication, Collaboration, and Creativity that will 
bring together our students' lives and their futures (RELEVANCE) in a nurturing and supportive 
environment (RELATIONSHIPS)."
 
 
Discovery S
chool is a place where students learn what it takes to become the innovators of 
tomorrow.  Discovery is a school where students are STARS! Because STARS Stay Safe, Take 
Responsibility, Aim High, Respect Everyone, Shine Bright all day every day.
 
 
Discovery 
uses the Positive Behavior Intervention and Support (PBIS) program.  Expected behaviors 
are modeled and taught to students and positive behaviors are routinely reinforced.  A recreation 
leader leads positive and engaging activities during recesses and lunc
h, and a full time school 
counselor, a full time campus supervisor as well as a full team of duty aides who promote school 
safety and supervise throughout the day.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountab
ility Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and A
ccountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in
 
the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improve
ments (Most Recent Year)
 
General
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Public Sch
ool Construction. The results of this survey are available at the school office or at the district 
office.
 
 
School Buildings
 
Discovery School was built in 2011.  The main building houses the front, health, and administrative offices, multi
-
purpose room/caf
eteria, staff lounge, 
computer lab and library.  There are 32 classrooms 
-
 
8 permanent and 23 relocatable.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the dis
trict. A summary of these standards is available at the district office. 
The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
Although the State no longer requires a Deferred Maintenance contribution, Lancaster School District is still dedicated to ma
intaining the facilities for 
our students.  These expenditures would include but not be limited to roofing, plumbing, heating, air 
conditioning, electrical, painting, and flooring.  For 
the 2019
-
20 school year, the district has budgeted $940,000 for deferred maintenance projects.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Projects
 
In 2019 the playground asphalt was reconditioned.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: 
Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smart
er Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

privacy.
 
 
Note: ELA and mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative 

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summ
ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number 
of students who participated in both assessments.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (Scho
ol Year 2019
-
20)
 
There are many ways to get involved at Discovery!  Parent volunteer forms are sent home with students at the beginning of the
 
year and are available at 
the Welcome Event held the week before school begins.  Parents have the opportunity to 
volunteer regularly for PBIS support in our Rocket Ticket Store, 
the library, book fairs, fundraisers, and school events.  Parents are encouraged to be a part of our active English Learners 
Advisory Committee, African
-
American Advisory Council, Parenting P
artners, and/or School Site Council.  These meetings are held throughout the school year.  In addition, parents 
are invited to attend family events such as Lunch on the Lawn, Back to School Night, Open House, and/or Family Curriculum Nig
hts.
 
 
Parents may c
ontact teachers about volunteering in the classroom as well. This can be an excellent way to support students directly!  Fing
erprinting and 
a TB test are required for all regular volunteers to ensure student safety.
 
 
Please visit the office for more inform
ation about these opportunities!
