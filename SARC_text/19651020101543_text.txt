By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
At Esperanza Elementary, every effort is made to 
insure a safe and secure campus.  Adult aides are employed to supervise 
students before school, at recess and lunch.  Esperanza's aides, teachers and administrators are trained in CPR and/or 
First Aid.  Fire and/or earthquake drills are conducted monthly. 
 

Each classroom has a small emergency cart with essential supplies that can easily be taken out during drills.  Additional 
supplies for each classroom are stored in the cargo bin located at the end o
f room 25, to be used for a actual emergency.
 
 
Our campus is completely fenced, with one main entrance and three secondary entrances that are only open at specific 
times in the morning and afternoon.  Staff is assigned supervision of the grounds and gates 
when our students arrive and 
leave school.  Esperanza staff also supervises three crosswalks during arrival and dismissal time to ensure our students 
safety.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Par

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Esperanza has many 
opportunities for parents to become an integral part of their children's education.  Parents can be 
classroom volunteers and assist in the classroom on a voluntary basis or they can assist as a room parent, helping for 
special events or occasions.  A very 
active PTA also provides enrichment opportunities for the students and any parent is 
welcome to participate.  Our PTA sponsors many events during the year and parents are welcome to help and/or attend. 
Parents are encouraged to participate on the School Si
te Council.  An ELAC (English Language Advisory Council) exists to 
assist the needs of our families whose primary language is not English. Our Eagle Club provides opportunities for parents 
of EL students to engage meaningfully in school.  There are weekly 
sessions that help parents access the curriculum as 
well as navigate the school system. At the district levels, parents can serve as volunteers in many capacities including the 
District Language Advisory Committee, District Advisory Committee, and committe
es that review technology, curriculum, 
and other such goals.  These committees generally meet monthly to focus on issues of interest to parents at the district

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-

A range of academic and 
social emotional supports exist for Westside students, many of which are unique to individual 
school sites, tailored to meet the needs of the members of each school community.  Many of these supports are provided 
by counselors (district and/or community
-
ba
sed), school psychologists, school nurses, specialists in 
Speech/Language/Hearing, adaptive physical education teachers, or behavior specialists.
 
 
Student Study and Child Study Teams assist students experiencing academic and/or social emotional challenges,
 
those 
with special needs, and with assessing eligibility for placement in special classes and/or recommending specialized services 
as needed. Special services and classes are offered for students with learning disabilities as well as other students with 
e
xceptional needs.
 
 
Twelve counselors provide a range of support services for Westside students.  Programs and services are developed and 
provided based on student data (such as referrals for threatening or self
-
harm behaviors and academic 
intervention 
letters) and the needs of the school site.  Often these programs build upon the skills and habits of mind that are nurtured 
and developed in Leadership Development through Physical Education (LDTPE), AVID, and Boys Town.  Examples of 
counselin
g programs include specific groups for strong
-
willed students, grief groups, groups for students who are 
exhibiting signs and behaviors due to trauma, academic organization groups (addressing academic organization of 
assignments, goals, and expectations), 
and community outreach and service clubs such as Student Ambassadors or 
Kindness Club. School counselors are assisted by a cadre of Campus Climate Assistants, highly trained paraprofessionals 
who provide social emotional support and structure for students 
during more unstructured parts of the school day like 
recess and lunch. Counselors and Educational Service staff members collaborate regularly with community agencies to 
facilitate alignment and coordination of resources and supports for students and their
 
families.
 
 
The district continues to collaborate with the Department of Mental Health to coordinate with local mental health 
agencies to provide School Based Mental Health services at all school sites for eligible students.
 
 
Behavior specialists provide s
tudent and staff support for students needing intensive behavior support and/or 
intervention.
 
 
Bilingual paraprofessional support staff provide assistance in the classroom for English Learners. Bilingual assistants 
receive ongoing professional development 
in the areas of strategies to support students learning English within the 
classroom; review of district wide academic programs supporting English Learners; specialized language practice used for 
translation during parent/teacher conferences; protocols for
 
English Learner identification; and criteria for student 
reclassification.

Several programs, designed to build students' emotional intelligence and capacity and to promote positive and proactive 
social decision making, reduce bullying, and build an inclu
sive culture continue to be implemented districtwide. Two of 
these are BoysTown (implemented in grades Kindergarten through 8) and Leadership Development through Physical 
Education for students in grades 4, 5, and 6.
 
 
A variety of online mathematics (i.e. 
Big Brains and ALEKS) and reading intervention (i.e. FastForWord) programs are 
accessible for students.  In addition to being used during the school day, students can also access these programs from 
home.  These online interventions are site
-
specific.
 
 
A v
ariety of extended learning opportunities like before/after school tutoring and/or lunchtime Learning Lab support were 
offered at all sites.  Learning Labs provide support with homework and opportunities for collaborative learning sessions.  
Tutoring may p
rovide review of foundational skills, frontloading of key skills and concepts, and/or homework assistance.  
Five days of intersession support is provided for middle school students during each spring and summer intersession.  An 
Extended School Year progra
m is available during the first part of summer intersession for those students with disabilities 
who qualify.  A traditional district wide summer school program was on hold for the summer of 2018 due to significant 
maintenance and repairs at school sites. 
In lieu of the summer school program for elementary students, optional 
interactive Summer Learning Kits were purchased for parents and caregivers to use with their students over the summer 
intersession. The Kits contained games, tools, and materials to sha
rpen and support reading, writing, and math skills.  
Additionally, the district offered its third summer KinderCamp during the summer.  The three
-
day experience was designed 
to provide an opportunity for incoming Kindergarteners and their parents to learn 
about Kindergarten expectations in a 
day camp

type environment.

The goal of professional learning is to provide staff members the support that they need to meet the diverse educational 
needs of Westside students. The key
 
area of focus for professional development and support for the 2018
-
2019 school 
year was the use of assessment data, particularly common formative assessment data, to guide and inform instruction.
 
 
Teachers, classified instructional classroom support staf
f, and site administrators are provided four days of professional 
development each year. These days are calendared work days.  For all groups, two of the days are dedicated to issues and 
needs related specifically to our English Learners, foster youth, or 
other at
-
risk students.  For teachers and site 
administrators, two of the four days are devoted to building their capacity to use data, particularly formative assessment 
data, to inform instruction.  For classified instructional staff, two days were devote
d a to a variety of topics including 
trauma
-
informed support for at
-
risk youth; BoysTown; Leadership Development through Physical Education; and meeting 
the academic needs of students with exceptional needs.
 
 
Teachers are also encouraged to engage in optio
nal professional learning opportunities that relate to their specific 
teaching assignment. Teachers are compensated at a contractual hourly rate for their participation in these sessions.
 
 
Similar opportunities are provided for our site administrators.  Mo
st regularly attend applicable ACSA Academies.  70% of

(SDC), and middle school m teachers received training in the newly adopted materials during the 2018

Professional learning opportun
ities are provided through a variety of formats including  conference/institute attendance,

-
district training delivered by consultants and or district staff members with release time for teachers, staff meetings, 
and individual and small group coaching.
  
Curriculum Resource Teachers, under the direction of the Director of Curriculum 
and Instruction, provide much of the individual and small group coaching support.  This is especially true in the area of 
integration of classroom technology tools to support
 
teaching and learning.  During the 2018
-
2019 school year a cadre of 
teacher leaders served as instructional coaches at the school sites.  These site
-
level teacher instructional leaders support 
their colleagues in utilizing instructional strategies that pr

low income, foster, and English Learner youth.
 
 
Instructional administrators meet monthly to share best practices related to areas of instructional focus and leadership 
for meaningful change 
in educational systems.  All instructional administrators are encouraged to (and supported in) 
participating in professional learning opportunities to deepen their instructional leadership talents and skills, including t
he 
professional academies sponsored 
by ACSA, the Association of California School Administrators.
 
 

district has developed a robust system for new teacher 
support including 1:1 support, Professional Learning Communities 
(PLCs), and direct classroom support. New teachers are assigned a mentor/coach dependent upon their credential status. 
Support providers, mentors, and coaches in the program are veteran teach
ers who have been released full
-
time from their 
classroom responsibilities.  Every new teacher is supported weekly at their site by their mentor/coach with the focus of 
support being aligned to their goal and individual support plan.  Full time administrat
ors/coaches also support the pre
-
interns and interns based upon the requirements of their university's memorandum of understanding and the 
requirements of the CTC.  The pre
-
intern and intern teachers participate in biweekly professional development based 
u
pon the district initiatives as well as their unique developmental needs.  Teachers holding a Preliminary credential are 
supported by teachers on special assignment who serve as full time Support Providers.  Those holding a Preliminary 
credential attend a 
series of six professional development opportunities specially designed and aligned with the California 
Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTPs). For veteran teachers needing additional support, the Peer Assistance and 
Review (PAR) program is designed
 
to improve the education of students by providing opportunities for additional training 
for all teachers.
