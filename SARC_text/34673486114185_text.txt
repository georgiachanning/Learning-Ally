Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

We believe that every student has unique needs, strengths, talents, and interests.
 
 
It is our mission to ensure that all learners have opportunities to meet their personal goals, and to have the skills, tools,
 
and confidence needed to achieve their d
reams and aspirations for college, career, and beyond.
 
 
At Marengo Ranch, we are making it personal.
 
 

 
Marengo Ranch Elementary School offers a safe, supportive environment for all students. We believe in personalized, 
focused learning f
or each and every student, and it is our goal to provide instruction and support that fits the needs, 
interests, strengths, and talents of all learners. Our libraries are Bright Future Learning Centers where students and 
families can learn, study, and util
ize new, state of the art technology. Extended hours, support staff, access to online 
services and programs provide rich opportunities for our students and families to learn beyond the walls of our classrooms. 
Technology tools in the classroom are embedded
 
in our instructional delivery system and allow our teachers to personalize 
the learning for their students. Web

members may make informed decisions about providing intervention o
r enrichment as needed. Marengo Ranch continues 
to be a school that believes in providing a positive, nurturing environment for our students. The emotional well
-
being of 
our students goes hand in hand with our academic focus. Character and strength develop
ment as well as student 

school spirit, volunteerism, service learning, and fundraising campaigns.

2019 
-
 
August
 
 
Galt Joint Union Elementary held a Public Hearing on Aug. 28, 2019, and determined that each school within the district 
has sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab eq
uipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned 
textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making 
the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the state are re
viewed by all 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. 
The table dis
plays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents are 

volunteering, and communicating with us.   Communication through our Parent Portal, Facebook, Twitter, Blackboard 
Connect, and classroom connection systems
 
such as Class Dojo and Bloomz provide many ways to keep families involved.  
The school also seeks parental participation in PTKC (Parent Teacher Kids Club), ELAC (English Learner Advisory 
Committee), and School Site Council. Events such as Family Bingo Ni
ght, Pancake Breakfast, and Family Dance Night are 
opportunities for parent involvement. Parents are enthusiastic about doing their part to create a positive school 
community.
