By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Panama Elementary School, established in 1875, is the oldest of nineteen elementary schools in the Panama
-
Buena Vista 
Union School District. The original school was esta
blished in 1875 and the present school site in 1939. The original school 
was named after the swampy area where it was built due to its similarities to the Isthmus of Panama. Located at 9400 
Stine Road in the growing southwest area of Bakersfield, it is rap
idly changing from a rural to a suburban school.  The 
students in grades K
-
6 are culturally, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse. Our majority population is Hispanic at 65% 
with 16% White, 11% Asian, 6% African
-
American, and 2% other.  About 75% of o
ur students participate in the Free and 
Reduced school lunch program. To ensure the achievement of all students, and to meet the needs of an English learner 
population of 25% and our low income students, we provide a half time assistant principal, an acade
mic coach, two full 
time reading intervention teachers, and a Sheltered English Immersion (SEI) kindergarten class. All students receive a 
rigorous, standards
-
aligned curriculum. Those students with special needs receive additional support through our 
inte
rvention teachers, our MTSS, and Panama Accelerated Learning (PAL).  A highly trained support staff, including the 
school nurse, psychologist, and speech pathologist  help design interventions and supports for students with special needs. 
The music special
ists and GATE program enhance and extend the curriculum. The School Accountability Report Card was 
established by Proposition 98, an initiative passed by California voters in November 1988. The Report Card, to be issued 
annually by local school boards for 
each elementary and secondary school in the state, provides for parents and other 
interested people a variety of information about the school, its resources, its successes, and the areas in which 
improvements are needed.
 
 
Programs for all students at Panam
a Elementary are systematic and explicit. The culture of collaboration supports the goal 
of collective efficacy, so important to the continued success of our students. Staff, families, and community members 
work together to provide a learning environment w
ith high expectations for all learners. Our combined efforts are focused 
on our students' academic, physical, social, and emotional growth. A dedicated staff rises to the challenge of helping all 
students reach proficiency through highly effective, researc
h
-
based instructional practices and sound assessment 
strategies. Teacher collaboration and articulation ensure that the kindergarten through sixth grade experience prepares 
students for junior high, high school and beyond.
 
 


-
fold:  1) to 
enable each student to acquire the academic, social, and emotional skills to compete successfully at higher academic 
levels, and 2) to enable each student to become a pro
ductive member of society, both professionally and personally, and 
to exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. Specific goals guide all members of our school community who 
work to accomplish the following: a) all students will develop a str
ong foundation of academic and higher order thinking 
skills, b) staff, students and their families, and the broader community will be involved as partners to promote the social, 
emotional, and academic success of students, c) the school will provide a safe
 
and nurturing learning environment in which 
students develop positive character traits, a sense of responsibility, and effective decision
-
making skills, and d) students 
will leave Panama with the knowledge and understanding to work collaboratively with ot
hers and respect individual 
differences, the ability to communicate effectively, and the necessary skills to be a contributing member of society.
 
 
Panama Elementary School received funds from the state based on the state's funding formula which provides ex
tra 
funding for English learners, students on the free/reduced lunch program, and foster students. In addition, Panama 
Elementary received federal Title I funds.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Panama Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for learning. A scheduled maintenance program is 
administered by the District to ensure that all classrooms and 
facilities are maintained to a degree of adequacy that 
provides for meaningful learning. Ongoing repairs and modifications to the physical plant exceed California Building and 

quarterly that OSHA requirements are 
met. The exterior grounds are well lit and the perimeter of the school facility is fenced for student protection and safety. 
A team of custodians ensures classrooms and campus grounds are kept clean and safe. The restro
oms are cleaned, 
sanitized and secured at the end of each school day with 100% of the toilets in operating condition. As outlined in our Safe 
Schools Plan, the safety committee has addressed concerns for the safe coming and going of our students. Staff rec
eive 
in
-
service in emergency protocol and CPR. Identifying tags are issued to substitute teachers, volunteers, and other visitors 
as they register in our office. The gates on the perimeter of the school playground are locked during school hours and staff 
m
embers are trained to activate lock down procedures in the event of an emergency. Our positive partnership with local 
law enforcement is evident in their quick response time when concerns arise. Designated staff members carefully 
supervise students on the 
playground and in the cafeteria. Grounds and playground equipment are inspected regularly 
for potential hazards. The District provides on
-
going training in CPR/First Aid as part of its staff development program. Fire 
and/or disaster drills occur monthly an
d a complete school site disaster plan has been prepared and is in place and 
available for public review. Scheduled certificated supervision of students begins officially at 7:20 a.m. when the school 
opens and supervision ends at 2:45 p.m.
 
Panama is curren
tly undergoing a 25 million dollar modernization which will be complete in the fall of 2020.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud
y.

students with opportunities to learn self
-
discipline through a 
system of consistent rewards and consequences for their 
behavior. Panama Elementary School believes students who develop a sense of personal responsibility will mature both 
academically and emotionally. Parents and students are informed of discipline polic
ies at the beginning of each school 
year through classroom orientation as well as individual parent
-
student handbooks.
 
 
Regular school attendance is a key factor for student success. Attendance laws and procedures are explained to parents 
in district and s
chool handbooks and a flyer is sent to every household. Parents are notified regularly if students are truant 
or tardy. Students with excessive tardies, truancies or unexcused absences are subject to disciplinary procedures including 
losing recess, detenti
on, and parent conferences. The district has established an Independent Study Program for any 
student who must be absent from school due to illness for an extended period of time.

Panama establishes guidelines to provide students with a meaningful, produc
tive, and enjoyable school experience. 
Appropriate behavior is encouraged through praise and motivational incentives as well as progressive discipline and 
conflict resolution tools to further develop personal growth. Expulsions occur only when required by 
law or when all other 
alternatives are exhausted. Character Education programs, such as Caring School Communities, teach and reward 
appropriate behavior. PBIS is a program that encourages rewards for positive behavior. Students receive STING tickets to 
be 
used for weekly drawings or our monthly STING store. Honor Hour, STING tickets, and Manners Money are programs 
established to promote positive behavior and a safe learning environment. The Parent Club provides funding for anti
-
bullying and positive behavio
r assemblies.
 
 
Our school's comprehensive school safety plan is reviewed and updated annually following a review by our school's 
leadership team, parent club, school site council, and local law enforcement. It was approved by the school site council 
on Oct
ober 17, 2019. Elements of the plan include our safe ingress/egress policy, fire drill procedures, earthquake 
procedures, lock
-
down procedures, and evacuation procedures. It also includes the role of the school site council, crime 
assessment data, child ab
use reporting procedures, suspension and expulsion policies, procedures to notify teachers of 
dangerous students, our discrimination and harassment policy, our dress code policy, an assessment of our school's 
physical environment, crisis intervention strat
egies, and our complete safe school action plan.

Title I 
 
 
Title I, Part A (Title I) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, (ESEA) provides financial assistance to local 
educational agencies (LEAs) and schools with high numbers or high percentages of children from low
-
income families to

program to ach
ieve proficiency on challenging State academic achievement standards. Title I schools with percentages of 
students from low
-
income families of at least 40 percent may use Title I funds, along with other Federal, State, and local 
funds, to operate a "school
 
wide program" to upgrade the instructional program for the whole school. Based on an analysis 
of student achievement data done be the school site, Title I resources may be used for professional development, 
supplemental instruction and intervention, paren
tal involvement, personalization and support for students with at
-
risk 
behaviors. Targeted assistance schools design, in consultation with parents, staff, and district staff, an instructional 
program to meet the needs of specifically identified students wh
o are failing, or most at risk of failing, to meet the State's 
challenging academic achievement standards . Both school wide and targeted assistance programs must use instructional 
strategies based on scientifically based research and implement parental in
volvement activities.
 
 
Title II 
 
 
The district uses Title II funds to increase the academic achievement of all students by helping schools and district (1) 
improve teacher and principal quality through professional development and other activities and (2) 
providing low
-
income 
and minority students greater access to effective teachers, principals, and other school leaders.
 
 
Title III 
 
 
The district uses Title III funds to help ensure that children who are limited English proficient, including 
immigrant children 
and youth, attain English proficiency, develop high levels of academic attainment in English, and meet the same 
challenging State academic content and student academic achievement standards as all children are expected to meet. 
The focus
 
is on professional development for teachers across the district that will: 1). Improve the instruction and 
assessment of ELs; 2). Enhance the ability of teachers to implement curriculum, and improve their instructional strategies
