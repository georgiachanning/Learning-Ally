By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Vision and Mission:
 
Rancho Cordova Elementary students are inspired, compassionate, and creative individuals who are empowered to excel 
beyond their own expectations. Staff, 
students, and parents collaborate to provide a safe, healthy learning environment 
where students have the confidence to take academic and social risks. The high expectations we have for our students 
will prepare them for their educational future. As positi

have the skills they need to navigate through a complex world.
 
 
School & Community Profile:
 
Rancho Cordova School has a student body enrollment of 498  Pre

Additionally, Rancho Cordova has a state preschool, a Transitional Kindergarten program, and four classes for students 
with mild to moderate learning disabilities. Rancho Cordova Elementary teams with a state program, After School 
Edu
cation Safety (ASES), to be able to offer an after school program to support students on campus until 6:00 pm Monday
-
Friday. The academic program at Rancho Cordova Elementary School stresses the importance of every child mastering 
grade level anchor standa
rds. Student progress is continually monitored with Every Child By Name (ECBN) meetings when 
staff group students to target individual student needs. Building reading skills and proficiency in mathematics is our top 
priority. Support for students goes way 
beyond the core classroom experience. A coordinated effort between teachers, a 
Title 1 Academic Coach, an Intervention Specialist, bilingual instructional assistants, and the school principal is aimed at 
success for all students. All students receive Multi
-
tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) for both academics and Social
-

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Rancho Cordova Elementary School was originally constructed in 1956 and is comprised of 22 classrooms, one cafeteria, 
one library, one staff lounge, and three playgrounds. The 2009 modernization included the remodeling of 
the main 
building, replacement of three portables, addition of conference room, six offices, a music room, and the refurbishment 
of the school fields and landscape.
 
 
Rancho Cordova Elementary School under went some modernization during the summer of 2014. 
Landscaping, irrigation, 
and plumbing were upgraded in targeted areas. In addition, a shade structure was erected on the intermediate playground 
and benches were installed to provide students a space to comfortably work. In the summer of 2017, a ball wall 
was 
installed on the playground.
 
 
Increasing staff and student access to technology has been a long
-
term goal. Internet connectivity is available with wireless 
connectivity across campus and Chromebooks are available for students to use in their classrooms
. Smart Boards are 
installed in every classroom, the computer lab, the conference room, and the Science Technology Engineering and Math 
STEM Lab. Document cameras have been installed in each classroom.
 
 
The primary and intermediate yard equipment is routin
ely inspected and updated to meet state standards for safety.
 
 
Every effort is made to maintain our campus as a welcoming, safe place. Students and staff alike pick up litter and ensure 
that the grounds are clean and in good repair. The lawns and landscapi
ng add to the beauty of our campus.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and work orders are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest prio
rity is given to 
emergency repairs. While reviewing this report, please note that even minor discrepancies are reported in the inspection 
process. The items noted in the table have been corrected or are in the process of remediation.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school is safe and clean. Restrooms and eating facilities are cleaned daily. Classrooms are cleaned every two days. 
Any safety hazard that is reported is reviewed immediately and resolved. Safety plans are reviewed each fall and spring. 
Plans have been
 
developed to address a wide variety of possible emergencies.
 
 
Our Safety Plan covers responses to fire, evacuation, and civil defense emergencies. Last year, Rancho Cordova Elementary 
School had 11 student accident reports. Staff is trained on procedures 
to deal with threatening individuals/violent 
intruders, bomb threats, earthquakes, flooding or severe weather, hazardous materials and vicious/suspected rabid 
animals. We have a site Safety Team that supports the general emergency procedures. All staff has
 
immediate 
communication to the office by use of two
-
way radios and/or classroom phones.  Staff also uses the Instant Message (IM) 
feature on teacher computers as a possible option for reaching staff.  This feature is also a way for the office to 'broadcas
t' 
a message to all staff.  We have monthly fire drill practice along with active shooter and lock
-
down drills. Each classroom 
has a red emergency bag with status cards, class lists and supplies, and an Emergency Quick Reference Guide posted by 
the door.

academics. The school gives special attention to students who experience achievement problems, difficulty coping with 
personal and family problems, trouble with decision making, or handling pee
r pressure.
 
 
In addition, teachers attend Program Monitor and coaches meetings at our district office to receive training on curriculum 
that can be shared at the school site. Grade level teams are also given release days to meet with other team throughout 
the district and share best practices.
