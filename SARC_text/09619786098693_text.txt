By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Green Valley has a fully equipped computer lab with 31
 
computers to support students in Grades K
-
2.  All Kindergarten 
through 2nd grade students receive weekly instruction in the lab from their classroom teacher; they also have a set of 6 
devices  (laptops and/or chromebooks) in their classroom. In addition t
here is one full class set of Chromebooks for second 
grade classrooms to share.  Grades 3
-
5 are equipped with a class set of Chromebooks so each student is assigned a device 
for use in  the classroom.  All classrooms have projectors and document cameras.  
Nine classrooms have Smart Boards 
and our library is equipped with a big screen TV.   Internet based instructional programs, such as Read Live, ST Math, Reflex
 
Math and Star Fall More, provide a balance for supplemental instructional support.
 
 
The SST 
(Student Success Team) approach is utilized at Green Valley to provide assistance for students who are needing 
academic, emotional or behavioral assistance.  The team consists of the parents, classroom teacher, resource specialist, 
school psychologist, sch
ool counselor and school administrator.  When needed, the school nurse and speech teacher are 
available to join in the meetings.  Green Valley School values the input of our parents and community and the SST process 
is just one example of how we work toget
her for the mutual benefit of the child.  We work together with our parent 
community to provide outstanding educational opportunities for our students.  Students are also recognized for 
accomplishments at awards assemblies throughout the school year.
 
 
Duri
ng the  2018
-
2019 school year Green Valley celebrated 40 years of excellence.  Our theme for the 2019
-
2020 school 
year is "Building Success".  We build academic success in our classrooms daily as well as building successful citizens.   At 
Green Valley, we 
have a positive, proactive philosophy.  We are in our third year of implementing PBIS (Positive Behavior 
Interventions and Supports) at Green Valley.   PBIS is an evidence
-
based approach for developing positive behavior in 
students and a positive climate f
or learning. Students are taught and practice "The Gator Way" which is to Be Respectful, 
Be Responsible and Be Safe.  We have student videos that demonstrate "The Gator Way" in all areas of our school (ie: 
lunchroom, library, office, field etc.) Students a
re explicitly taught the expectations for all areas of the school. Students 
earn Gator Way Tickets for positive behavior.  Tickets are entered into a weekly drawing for our Wheel Spin as well as 
used to purchase rewards from their classroom store. Teaching
 
behavior expectations and rewarding students for 
following them is a more positive approach than waiting for misbehavior to occur before responding.   PBIS establishes a 
climate in which appropriate behavior is the norm. This year we are implementing the 
next tier of PBIS which includes 
Check In Check Out (CICO).  CICO is for students who need a more individualized behavior system.  They Check In at the 
start of the day with an adult and out again at the end of the day.  These students have specific goals 
they are working to 
achieve and are given daily feedback on their progress toward mastering those goals.  We are also implementing 
restorative practices as part of our  PBIS program.  Staff is being trained on restorative chats and classroom teachers use 
r
estorative circles in their classrooms.  Our school counselors teach weekly guidance lessons to all classes using the Second 
Step curriculum.  Lessons are grade level specific and focus on body language, social skills and cues, communication skills, 
buildi
ng friendships and self esteem. Our counselors also work with groups of students on specific strategies or areas of 
need (ie: friendship groups, divorce groups, grief etc.)  Character traits are featured each month and students from each 
grade level are ho
nored during awards assemblies for demonstrating strong citizenship.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
School buildings and 
grounds at Green Valley provide a clean, positive environment that is conducive to teaching, 
instruction and learning. Staff and student restrooms are clean but in need of new flooring.  Floors, walls, roofs, and 
plumbing are maintained on a regular schedu
le. All efforts to ensure building safety, cleanliness, and adequacy have been 
successful.
 
 

to make the facility as great as it can be.
  
Over the last few years we have improved our facility in many different and 
important ways.  All of the playground shade structures are now repaired and in full working condition.  Our parent teacher 
organization has completed a seating area around our o
utdoor stage area.  We have an ADA handicapped accessible 
outdoor lunch table.   We were recently able to update our sound system in the Plumb Center.  We are proud of our school 
facilities at Green Valley, and it is our desire to continue to improve the c
ampus for our students.   We look forward to our 
upper field being resurfaced and replanted sometime in the near future.  The lower campus E wing portables are in very 
poor condition and need to be replaced or removed including the E wing restroom.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and 
Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades th
ree 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the mo
st significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education seq

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
A positive learning environment is fundamental to an effective school. All students are encouraged to be respectful, be 
responsible and to be safe.  Gator Manners are modeled and promoted by all staff.  Staff members work to teach our 
students how to "fill
 
buckets," by treating others with kindness.  Measures to deal with discipline, tardiness and truancy 
are an important part of our program. There are many encouraging and motivating activities taking place in the school. 
School
-
wide positive incentives inc
lude awards assemblies and honor roll.  Gator Way Tickets are given to students who 
demonstrate the Gator Way (Respectful, Responsible, Safe) both in and out of the classroom.  Gator Way Tickets are used 
by students to "purchase" rewards of their choice su
ch as reading a story to another class, games with the principal etc.  
Recess activities are provided (ex. Drawing Club, Game Day, Music Mania, Mileage Club and School Community Service) 
to allow our students more choices for free time and peer interaction
. IMPACT, our student leadership organization, offers 
leadership skill building and opportunities to provide service.

We currently have two and a half full
-
time custodians. Policies are in place regarding campus safety so that during recess 
and lunch periods adequate supervision is provided to protect the students. Fire dri
lls are conducted monthly as part of 
our disaster preparedness plan; lockdown and duck and cover drills are also held at least twice each year. All efforts to 
ensure building safety, cleanliness, and adequacy have been successful.  Green Valley School Site
 
Council has implemented 
a Site Safety Plan whose two major goals this year are to provide a positive school climate modeled by staff and students 
and provide a physically safe environment.  The plan is reviewed annually and updated as needed.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
All Rescue schools receive equal allocations, per student, of LCFF Base Funding.  This funding helps support students by 
providing supplemental instructional materials, supplies, and other needs.  Funding for support services, such as 
maintenance of buildi
ngs and grounds, utilities, and student transportation, is budgeted for at the district level and 
provided to each school site based on the varying needs of the individual school.
 
 
In addition to the Base Funding described above, schools in the Rescue Unio
n School District receive Supplemental funding 
roughly proportional to the number of unduplicated pupils (English Learners, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged, and 
Foster/Homeless Youth) they serve.  Furthermore, school sites receive allocations from other st
ate and federal categorical 
programs, including Title I and Title II.  The purpose of these categorical programs range from improving the quality of the 
total instructional program for all students to addressing the unique needs of special groups of studen
ts.  Title III funds 
are budgeted for at the district level, but provide direct support to the school sites.  Title III funds are used to employ 
bilingual instructional assistants and an EL Coordinator who provides professional development and instructiona
l support 
as well as monitors the progress of our English learners.

Early Release days and District Days are used for professional development and teacher collaboration.  During these 
meetings, teachers work to analyze assessment data and target key standards.  In addition, they plan, 
develop and improve 
effective instructional strategies.  Staff development related to instructional practices, curriculum, technology, CA State 
Standards, and other educationally related matters are provided for all teachers.  Green Valley teachers have be
en trained 
and certified in Guided Language Acquisition Development (GLAD) strategies.  Teachers work in grade level teams to build 
GLAD instructional units, EL strategies and analyze assessment data  each trimester.  At the elementary sites, five minimum 
days are scheduled for parent conferences and three days for report card preparation.
