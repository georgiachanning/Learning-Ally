By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

It is our hope that we continue her legacy, making sure that everything we do is in the best interest of each child. Each 
staff member has been carefu
lly selected because they are extremely skilled at what they do, but most of all, because 
they have huge hearts for children. 
 
 
High academic expectations, and a focus on appropriate social behavior, will be evident on our campus on a daily basis. 
We wholeheartedly believe that every child can be successful. 
 
 
THE STUDENTS, STAFF, PARENTS AND COMMUNITY OF SUSAN LAVORGNA ELEMENTARY 
SCHOOL WORK TOGETHER TO 
CREATE A SAFE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT THAT PROMOTES RESPECTFUL, SELF

DIRECTED, SUCCESSFUL LEARNERS. 
 

 
All students will be required to work to their full potential toward meeting the academic standards.
 

 
The school community will 
work together to develop the social skills necessary for success in a diverse, global 
society.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
La Vorgna Elementary School was built in 2005. The campus has 51 permanent classes, a multipurpose room, a library, 

ntenance and Operations division works diligently to ensure our facilities are 
clean and safe for students, teachers and staff. The district follows a comprehensive preventive and deferred maintenance 
program to offset costly repairs and minimize disruptio
ns to the instructional program. Daily cleaning schedules ensure 
that classrooms, offices and bathrooms are clean and well maintained. Our school has one full time lead custodian during 
school hours, and a night crew that comes in and cleans the entire fac
ility after school hours. In addition, between two 
and three times a year the carpets at each site are steam cleaned.In order to respond to work requests in a timely manner, 
the district utilizes an electronic work order system. When a site secretary, cust
odian or administrator has a request, they 
can put it into the system directly. This makes for a more time efficient processing of work orders.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of S
tudent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathema
tics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] f
or 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career 
technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School safety is a high priority for our school and district. Our school has a comprehensive School Safety Plan, which is 
updated and approved annually. The plan covers topics such as disaster response, safe ingress and egress, and ensuring a 
safe and orde
rly environment. Additionally, the plan includes data on suspensions and expulsions, as well as school and 
district crime data.
 
 
Our school is a closed campus that is fully enclosed by fencing. School visitors and volunteers are required to sign in at th
e 
front office prior to entering campus using the Raptor System, which completes a backcheck via federal identification. In 
instances of emergency, we use an automated telephone/email system through Blackboard to contact parents with 
pertinent information.
 
 
To better prepare our teachers, students and staff for emergencies, our schools conducts fire, earthquake, and lockdown 
drills regularly throughout the school year. Education Code mandates that all elementary and middle schools hold a fire 
drill each month
 
they are in session as well as an earthquake drill at least four times during the school year.

District Commitment to Learning for All Students
 
 
The Temecula Valley Unified School District is committed to ensuring that each and every child in its care receives a 
rigorous, multifaceted educational experience preparing them for the demands of college and career.
 
 
TVUSD teachers engage in active staff
 
development throughout the year by attending:
 
 
In
-
District training sessions provided by staff and consultants.
 
 
Site
-
based training sessions presented during staff meetings and committee/grade level meetings.
 
 
One on one training provided during formal o
bservations and post observation conferences. One teacher per grade to 
attend the CUE conference and come back to be the trainer at each grade level.
 
 
Staff members are sent to national and state conferences to fine
-
tune instructional practices in specific
 
areas.
 
 
Teachers with specialized training are given opportunities to train their peers, and provide instructional support as teacher
 
leaders.
 
 
Standards Based Instruction : Staff development focuses on implementing the New State Standards and state 
frameworks 
in English
-
Language Arts, Science, social science, and Math, K
-
12. Routine district sessions bring teacher leaders and 
principals together to devise and refine the curriculum and assessments. Teams began by identifying priority and 
supporting st
andards, grouping the standards into units of instruction, and crafting common interim and summative 
assessments, developing scoring rubrics, and discussing sound grading practices for each course/grade. Leaders return to 
sites to facilitate their grade le
vel/course teams in reviewing the work, suggesting resources, and providing feedback for 
the refinement committees.
 
 
Technology Coaches at each site to support teachers in the implementation of new technology practices.
 
 
Collaborative Teams: Teachers are d
ivided into Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) based on content area and grade 
level. All instructional staff participate almost weekly during professional growth time meeting in their PLC groups to align
 
curriculum, refine teaching strategies, creat
e assessments, analyze student achievement data and transition to New State 
Standards.
