About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted a
ccording to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by a
ll teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Boa
rd by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. The table displays information collected in Sept. 
11, 2019 about the quality,

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of the Brentwood Union 
School District.  The district and schools are in compliance with all laws, rules, 
and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The School Site Safety plan was last review
ed and updated 3/1/2019 
by the School Safety Com

s 
plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a regu
lar 
basis throughout the school 
year.  Lockdown and Lockout drills are held twice a year. Students are supervised before and after school and during lunch by
 
certificated and classified 
staff and the principal. Parent volunteers help with supervision during lu
nch and break periods. There is a designated area for student drop off and pick 
up. All visitors are required to check in at the office upon arrival and before departing from the school campus.  Visitor ba
dges are issued at the time of 
check
-
in and are to 
be worn throughout the visit.  All visitors are scanned by our Raptor Visitor system.
 
 
Discipline & Climate for Learning
 

: All stud
ent will have a safe 
school culture, climate and learning environment in order to support student physical, mental and emotional health.  All site
s have implemented best 
practices for character education, bullying prevention, diversity appreciation program
s, and social media education.  In addition, students in the 
Brentwood Union Elementary School District are guided by specific rules and classroom expectations that promote respect, coop
eration, courtesy and 
acceptance of others. Parents and students are i
nformed of school rules and discipline policies through the (Parent/Student and book/newsletters/Friday 
folders) which are sent home throughout the school year.
