By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Good Hope Elementary School is one of eight elementary schools in the Perris Elementary School District.  The school is 
located just outside the city of Perris and was built in 1962. The school Good
 
Hope is on a modified
-
traditional schedule 
and serves Pre
-
School
-
6th
-
grade students from diverse cultural and socio
-
economic backgrounds in a suburban/rural area.  
The current enrollment for the 2019 

 
2020 school year is approximately 600 students, compr
ised of 4% African American, 
2% white, and 93% Hispanic.  Our school serves 56% English Learners and 79% socioeconomically disadvantaged families.
 
 
At Good Hope Elementary we believe all students can learn. Therefore, we continue to have high expectations 
for student 
learning.  Our instructional program is based on the Common Core State Standards, which outline what students need to 
know and learn at each specific grade level. We emphasize high
-
quality instruction and employ a wide variety of 
instructional 
tools, strategies, and formative assessments to monitor instruction, improve teaching and ultimately achieve 
high levels of learning for all students.
 
 
We continue to use our resources to carry out the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement. The purpose of th
is plan is to 
improve student performance and to ensure that all students succeed in reaching academic standards set by the State 
Board of Education.  Teachers, the assistant principal, and principal continue to enhance their skills and knowledge through 
p
rofessional development in the core content areas of English Language Arts, Mathematics and English Language 
Development.  Additionally, Social Emotional Learning is also a focus, as we believe it is important that our students 
develop the skills necessary
 
to manage emotions, establish and maintain positive relationships, set goals, monitor their 
progress towards achieving their goals, and ultimately experience increased academic success. To ensure we are meeting 
the diverse needs of all students, Palms has
 
embraced the Professional Learning Communities (PLC) model where we 
encourage and promote collaboration among teachers, coaches, resource personnel, and classified staff, as a means to 
establish and maintain a high performing team that is committed to ens
uring high levels of learning for all students.
 
 
Parents and community members have an informed partnership with the school. We welcome participation in our school 
and encourage our stakeholders to join and participate in the many parent involvement opport
unities offered throughout 
the year.  If interested in a more long
-
term commitment, the Good Hope Volunteers (GHV), the Family Involvement Action 
Team (FIAT), School Site Council (SSC), or our English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) might be of interest
.   For those 
looking to simply relax and enjoy time with their family and friends, we offer a host of fun activities throughout the year 
such as family reading, math, and art nights, as well as a variety of dances, performances, etc..
 
 
School Motto:  Buil
ding Learners for Life.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Our campus is more than 40 years old. Overall, Good Hope Elementary School is in good condition, and we provide regular 
maintenance and improve su
ch things as roofs and rest room facilities and fixtures. We have replaced exterior wooden 
siding and many classroom carpets. We recently finished painting the campus. We receive excellent support from the 
district maintenance department for larger project
s. A district team and assigned staff at the school monitor the facilities 
on an ongoing basis.
 
 
In 2008

2009 six new classrooms were added to our campus. Eight
-
foot fencing and an electric gate were added to 
enhance campus safety and security. New air
-
con
ditioning, new roofing, re
-
asphalting, and new cement work enhanced 
our campus. We have already completed the renovation of our cafeteria/multipurpose room, which included new flooring 
and a sound system.
 
 
During the summer of 2009, we remodeled our school

improvements to the existing plaster and paint throughout the school.

More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for 
by 
the Williams legislation of 2004. What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their 
structural integrity, electrical systems, heating and ventilation systems, and more. The important purpose of this 
assessment is t
o determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good repair. If anything needs to be repaired, this 
assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for this assessment 
were written by the Office
 
of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You 
can look at the six
-
page Facilities Inspection Tool used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our distri
ct sent experts from our facilities team to inspect them. They used a 

e 
answered the questions you see on this report. Please note 
that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as 
of the date of the report. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for 
students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the admini
stration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successf
ully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Good Hope, we believe there is a
 
direct correlation between student achievement and parent involvement.  The staff 
at Good Hope Elementary School is committed to partnering with parents and providing opportunities for parent 
engagement. Parents are welcome at school, and the school staff
 
truly appreciates their support and participation. Parents 
are invited to attend Back
-
to
-
School Night in the fall, Open House in the spring, and parent
-
teacher conferences in 
November. Good Hope Elementary School encourages parental and community involvem
ent and provides a wide variety 
of participation activities.  Parent and community involvement is encouraged through our Good Hope Volunteers group, 
our Family Involvement Action Team (FIAT), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) and the School Site C
ouncil 
(SSC).  In addition to serving on one of our many committees, our parents also have the opportunity to participate in a 
variety of parent training opportunities and workshops. Additionally, parents are always welcome to volunteer in 
classrooms, and/
or assist with the planning and implementation of many of the extracurricular events and activities 
offered throughout the year.
 
 
In addition to the site based committees, there are several regularly scheduled parent
-
focused groups and committees 
offered t
hrough the district such as the District English Advisory Committee (DELAC), the District Parent Advisory 
Committee (DPAC) and the District African American Advisory Committee (DAAPAC).  These committee groups are 
structured to allow for collaborative conv
ersations and  interactions between district staff, parents and other stakeholder 
groups to give feedback and suggestions regarding programs and services for students.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety is an important focus at Good Hope Elementary School. Our policies ensure a safe and secure campus. Playground 
supervisors monitor student activities and enforce school rules. We maintain a closed campus. We welcome parents and 
guardians on campus a

before gaining access to the campus.
 
 
Good Hope Elementary has a safety plan that is updated annually by the site emergency preparedness committee. Staff
 
members are instructed on the essential components. All students and staff practice monthly fire, earthquake, or 
lockdown drills. This includes duck and cover and evacuation drills, along with lockdown procedures. We practice our 
complete school
-
wide disa
ster plan twice
-
annually, the last being on 10
-
17
-
19. We maintain an accessible storage unit on 
campus with the supplies necessary for an emergency.  In the event of a true emergency, our site utilizes the Blackboard 
Connect
-
Ed system to notify parents.
 
 
G
ood Hope Elementary has video surveillance cameras across our campus as a deterrent to trespassers, vandalism, and 
other illegal activities. They also help administrators and local law enforcement with the investigation of any crimes that 
occur on campus a
fter school hours, making our school safer and more secure.

Student data is reviewed regularly to monitor student achievement, set goals, and identify focus areas for professional 
development opportunities for teachers and 
support staff. Once the areas of need have been identified, our teachers and 
staff have the opportunity to participate in a variety of workshops, conferences, and other professional development 
opportunities through both district training, and site

academic coach is available to all teachers through a 
collaborative process. Expectations are modeled throughout staff meetings and during professional development. 
Teachers are given opportunities to calibrate and collaborate using data. Follow up support
 
is provided by the academic
