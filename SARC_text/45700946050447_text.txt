School Description
 
Pacheco School is a small school that is able to provide high
-
quality teaching, 
offer a variety of 
opportunities to all students including academics, extra
-
curricular, and athletic.  We have a strong 
4th 
-
 
8th grade GATE program and 6th
-
8th grade Honors program which provides students with the 
opportunity to be excelled, with regular 
project
-
based learning activities.  We are able to offer 
foreign language to 6
-
8 grade students, within our elective wheel, as well as an opportunity to be 
excelled in the younger grades.
 
 
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) is also a 
focus for Pacheco School.  Our 
teachers have been trained in the Shasta County STEM Grant and implement these practices into 
their classroom on a regular basis.  We make a strong effort to provide students with hands
-
on 
activities that promote all types of
 
learning.
 
 
Intervention has become a focus as of the 2019
-
20 school year as well.  With the new state 
standards in place and new state testing and accountability, a focus on academic support has 
become a priority to equip all students with the necessary s
kills to be prepared for upcoming grade 
levels and beyond.  Intervention periods have been built into the master schedule and teachers 
along with our Intervention teacher are using data to construct groupings within their classrooms 
for more effective lear
ning opportunities for their students at their levels.
 
 
Students are well
-
behaved, on task, and caring.  Our teachers are well
-
equipped to teach the new 
state standards and implement the latest teaching strategies to prepare our students for success 
both a
cademically and in extra
-
curricular activities.  We strive to effect all students positively on a 
daily basis by providing a safe, comfortable environment that is conducive to all types of learners.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
Pacheco School offers support to students via intervention periods within the school day for grades 
4th 
-
 
8th. For grades 6th
-
8th enrichment classes offered in Spanish, 
French, career options, 
nutrition, computer, and plyometrics. In addition, students have access to a Social/Emotional 
counselor. Students also have the opportunity to participate in GATE, art, and music. English learner 
students have academic support.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/

and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic 
system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).

Intern
et access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., 
the California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally 
provided on a first

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is require
d by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) a
re required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LC
AP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and
