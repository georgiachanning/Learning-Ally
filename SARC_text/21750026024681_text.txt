Description
 
Brookside is one of four elementary schools in the Ross Valley School District serving transitional 
kindergarten through 5th grade students.  Our campus is a hub for community activities, as 
neighboring children and adults use our field, basket
ball courts, and play structures after school 
and on weekends. We also work closely with the San Anselmo Recreation Department so that our 
facilities can be utilized for community recreational programs. Brookside is a Zero Waste Marin 
school with an active
 
student Green Team overseeing campus recycling and composting.  There is 
an active Student Government for 4
-
5 grade students and Brookside participates in Safe Routes to 
Schools.    Our Garden Coordinator provides instruction to all TK
-
5 students in our f
lourishing school 
garden.  Additionally, Children for Change meets weekly at Brookside and provides an opportunity 
for all students to participate in service learning and empowering children to make a difference in 
the world.   Brookside added a new multip
urpose room, outdoor play structure and playground 
space in the spring of 2018.
 
 
Brookside is located in Marin County of San Anselmo, California. The campus houses transitional 
kindergarten through 5th grade and a continuum for special education services i
ncluding a resource 
program and three special day classes for early childhood, TK
-
2 and 3rd
-
5th grades. Brookside is 
committed to providing a program of academic excellence, cultural richness, social emotional, and 
physical development that educates, suppo
rts, challenges and inspires the whole child. We believe 
every child has the innate ability and desire to learn, and all children need challenge and support 
to grow to their full potential. We work together as a team to create an environment that enables 
s
tudents to develop a healthy self
-
worth, understand and respect diversity, think critically and 
creatively, take risks, work in collaboration with their peers, and show respect for the earth. 
Brookside teachers and staff strive to provide students with ins
truction that is engaging and 
challenging.
 
 
Students are educated in ways that reflect diverse learning styles, individual strengths, interests, 
and differentiated needs. The utmost challenge and goal is to make learning meaningful and deep 
while also bein
g accountable for the Common Core Standards. Brookside is committed to helping 
students develop life
-
long learning skills and capacities, including but not limited to collaboration, 
critical thinking, questioning, and information literacy.  Social/emotiona
l development is at the 
heart of our curriculum and daily instruction is infused with culturally responsive educational 
practices that help our Brookside bears grow socially/emotionally as well as academically.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educatio
nal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, d
ata reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.g
ov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, 
parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Ross Valley School District passed a $41 million facility bond in November 2010 to accommodate increased 
enrollment and replacement and or 
repairs at Brookside School and at all other schools in the district. in 2012
-
2013 the school was outfitted with a new technology lab, updated art room 
furniture, and 21st century classroom technology and furniture in its 
two 5th grade classrooms. In the spring of 2014 the district invested in technology 
infrastructure updates at all campuses in the district to improve speed and internet accessibility. Brookside added 5 new cla
ssrooms in the summer of 
2014 to accommodate in
creasing enrollment.  Summer of 2017, the multi purpose room and playground were replaced.  Back parking lot was 
reconfigured for safety.
 
 
Ross Valley School District uses Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies and the least toxic method of pest contr
ol possible as a means to control 
unwanted pests. In accordance with AR 3514.2 IPM strategy focuses on long
-
term prevention or suppression of pest problems through a combination of 
techniques such as monitoring for pest presence and establishing treatment 
threshold levels, using non
-
chemical practices to make the habitat less 
conducive to pest development, improving sanitation, and employing mechanical and physical controls. Pesticides that pose the
 
least possible hazard 
and are effective in a manner that m
inimizes risks to people, property, and the environment are used only after careful monitoring indicates they are 
needed according to established guidelines and treatment thresholds( California Education Code §17609; Food and Agricultural 
Code§ 13181).

School Safety Plan
 

developed in 
coordination 
with Marin County emergency agencies such as Ross Valley Police and Ross Valley Fire. Our plan includes procedures for earthq
uake, fire, and lock down 
situations and shelter in place.  The school community practices a variety of emergency dril
ls on a scheduled basis.  Students are trained to play active 
roles in these drills.  School Administrators and staff attend annual trainings to better prepare the school for unanticipate
d emergencies. The plan includes 
procedures for disaster preparedness
 
and response. Our site's emergency plan includes a complete NIMS chart, and the required emergency drills (fire, 
earthquake, lock down and shelter in place)  per year, and emergency training for all staff. Training includes search and res
cue, basic first 
aid, and student 
release. Our emergency supply container is checked and re
-
stocked yearly. Board policies on suspension and expulsion, procedures to notify teachers of 
dangerous pupils, sexual harassment, school
-
wide dress code, procedures of safe ingress 
and egress of pupils and rules and procedures on school 
discipline are also components of the plan. The plan may be reviewed in detail at the school site.
 
 
The District has installed window film for safety and security at each site. All door locks have bee
n checked and only require a push button to lock and 
secure each room.  In addition, the telephone system allows each school to call 911 and to contact the District in the event 
of an emergency.  Also, 
walkies talkies system has been upgraded for each site
 
to contact the District. All door locks have been checked and only require a push button or simple 
motion to remove a door block  to lock and secure each room.  In addition, the telephone system allows each school to call 91
1 and to contact the District 
i
n the event of an emergency.  Also, the walkies talkie system has been upgraded for each site to contact the District and all
 
school personnel have walkie 
talkies to communicate at the site level.
