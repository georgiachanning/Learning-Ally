By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Accountability Report Card was established by Proposition 98, an initiative passed by California voters in 
November 1988. The Report Card, issued annually by school boards for each public school in the state, provides for parents 
and 
other interested people a variety of information about the school, its resources, its successes, and areas in which 
improvement is needed. As you read our Arroyo report card, I hope you will be pleased with our continuous improvement. 
Our staff is outstand
ing in leadership, instructional abilities, and concern for students. Each employee at our school has 
the best interests of your children at heart. We strive to prepare students to be effective communicators, problem solvers, 
collaborative workers, and pro
ficient users of technology. Our goal is that all students will be prepared to graduate from 
high school and go to college.
 
 
I hope you will find this report informative and beneficial. If you would like additional information on any of these areas, 
or wou
ld like to visit our school, please feel free to call my office at (909) 397
-
4568, or send me a message at 
claudia.ruiz@pusd.org.
 
 
I welcome your comments on this report! Claudia Ruiz, Principal
 
 
Our responsibility is to provide an education that challenge
s our students academically, personally and socially. It is our 
belief that by enhancing the educational growth of students they will develop a commitment to personal excellence. 
Arroyo maintains a high quality, safe, respectful, and clean learning environ
ment. While the facilities are more than 50 
years old, the staff and students keep the campus and classrooms clean and in order.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to 
the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education popu
lation and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are a
ligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy th
e requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pare

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Many individuals and groups 
provide support for the educational program at Arroyo Elementary School. The Arroyo 
Elementary PTO sponsors the parent center, fundraisers, volunteer activities, and promotes school spirit in the 
community. Funds raised are used to purchase motivational an
d positive reinforcement materials and activities, teacher 
support, student equipment and student recognition. The School Site Council is composed of parents and school staff. It 
meets monthly to develop and monitor the school's 
School Plan
 
for Student Ach
ievement (SPSA). This plan identifies the 
school's strengths and weaknesses, academic goals, and an action plan that describes how those goals will be met.
 
 
Many local businesses and individuals enrich our school program through direct donations of goods a
nd services. Students 
also benefit from a significant number of parent volunteers who share their special talents working in the classroom, 
completing teacher work projects, planning special activities, or chaperoning field trips.
 
 
Parents are an integral 
part of Arroyo Elementary School. In addition to participating on the School Site Council and Arroyo 
Elementary PTO, parents are involved as members of the English Language Advisory Council and the Site Advisory Council. 
Monthly meetings are held to dissem
inate program information and to provide an opportunity for parent input on various 
school wide issues. Additionally, twice a year parents are asked for their opinions and suggestions through school wide 
parent surveys. Parent education is offered in Paren
ting, How to Help Your Child at Home, Mathematics, Common Core, 
and other topics as identified through surveys of parents and teachers. This year we offered training focused on: accessing 
online resources to support the education of their children, use of 
Zearn, Achieve 3000 and Footsteps to Brilliance 
programs at home, supporting your child in Common Core lessons in Math and ELA and developing strategies for behavior 
management at home and at school through our Positive Behavior and Interventions School re
launch.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety: Safety of the students and staff is a primary concern of the Pomona Unified School District. All schools in the distr
ict 
are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials. All staff attended training and a 
dis
aster preparedness plan is in place for earthquakes and emergency evacuations. All buildings within the district are in 
compliance with state earthquake standards. A discipline policy (PBIS implementation) that seeks to insure a safe and 
orderly environmen
t for students and staff is also in place. A Safe School Plan has been adopted and revised on October 
29, 2018 , and it includes policies on disaster preparedness, student discipline, the components of a safe and orderly school
 
environment, suspension/expu
lsion procedures, safety, child abuse reporting procedures, student dress codes, and 
student and staff sexual harassment. . A school wide Discipline Committee(PBIS team) was formed to revise our student 
discipline plan and address any ongoing concerns. Dat
a is collected and reviewed regularly to target behavioral concerns 
and students who are demonstrating challenges following the behavioral expectations.  Behavioral interventions are 
implemented in a Tiered System of support.  The Arroyo Code is recited da
ily to focus students on being safe and 
respectful. We utilize the four behavior expectations of Practice Respect, Act Responsibly, Work Hard and Stay Safe to 
provide a learning environment where all students can succeed. Behavior expectation posters are p
osted throughout our 
campus so that students are reminded of the PAWS expectations in different settings of our campus.

semester), to analyze student achievement data in a collegial forum. They 
then design effective instructional interventions 


 

School Plan

District and site professional development also includes trainings around 21st Century Teaching and Learning which 
include the California State Standards and the P21 Framework. Training
 
outcomes are to build the capacity of site and 
teacher leaders to lead the transition and implementation of the California State Standards. Sessions include themes such 
as the need for a paradigm shift in teaching and learning, the essential components of
 
the P21 Framework, California State 
Standards, English Learner standards and framework, equity and culturally responsive instruction, social and emotional 
learning, and integrating the use of technology to enhance/support instruction and learning. Perform
