Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):

the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pa
rental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Clearwater strives to 
promote a positive and strong home school partnership with all stakeholders in order to provide a 
safe and stimulating academic program. Clearwater fosters student achievement and success based upon a strong school 
and community collaboration. Clearwater E
lementary continues to encourage and foster parental involvement through 
many parental involvement opportunities for student, teacher, family and community opportunities. 
 
 
The Family Involvement Action Team provides planning of program activities for pare
nt involvement. Parents, as members 
of the Family Involvement Action Team (FIAT) enhance the quality of Clearwater's school climate. FIAT support initiatives 
such as; Dive into Reading events, Dive Into Math, Family Reading Night, Red Ribbon Week, spirit d
ays, assemblies, 
teacher/class support, field trips, rewards and schoolwide incentives. Activities through our Family Involvement Action 
Team include parent workshops, reading in the classroom with students while acquiring strategies and tools to support 
a
ll learners. 
 
 
Family nights for English Language Arts, Math, Science, Homework, , AVID, Science, Technology, special performances, 
and volunteer opportunities are held throughout the school year. Parents and community members are included in 
planning, imp
lementing and evaluating our programs through our different parent committees. School Site Council and 
English Language Advisory Committee are comprised of staff and parents, working collaboratively with staff in determining 
the best way to utilize funds t
o provide additional materials, programs, and staff development to our academic program. 
Parents of English learners are vital stakeholders to our English Language Advisory Committee and to our outreach efforts 
on behalf of new families. Title 1 meetings a
re held at least twice per year to collect information and feedback from our 
parents and families. This information is utilized to more effectively plan the use of our funds for different programs to 
optimize student achievement. 
 
 
The 
Clearwater's newsletter highlights success, programs and parent involvement opportunities Clearwater's school plan 
is accessible on our site website in order to maintain stakeholders informed of school program. This is another way for 
our families and comm
unity to be informed and maintained positive involvement. Parents will be notified of district and

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Clearwater Elementary School is a model facility, reflecting that our highest priority is the safety and welfare of our 
students. Clearwater provides a safe, clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance and campus 
supervision. All s
ite staff, administrators, teachers, and supervision aides monitor the school campus to ensure a safe 
learning environment for our students.  The campus is a closed campus, with access through the front office reception 
area; all guests, visitor, and vendo
rs are required to check
-
in in the front office, where they are logged in through the 
Raptor System before gaining authorized access to the campus.
 
 
Our school has an Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan that aligns with the NIMS Emergency System. The 
plan 
specifies procedures for dealing with fire, flood, earthquakes, lock downs, hazardous materials, disaster recovery 
organization, and student accountability, following a disaster. These plans are updated and reviewed annually.  In addition, 
we have sta
te
-
of
-
the
-
art intrusion and fire alarm systems and we routinely conduct a variety of safety drills, to ensure that 
our students and staff are well prepared  to respond in the event of an emergency.   In the event of a true emergency, our 
site utilizes the 
Blackboard Connect
-
Ed system to notify parents.
 
 
Video surveillance cameras across our campus are a deterrent to trespassers, vandalism, and other illegal activities. These 
also help administrators and local law enforcement with the investigation of any cr
imes that occur on campus after school 
hours, making our school safer and more secure.
