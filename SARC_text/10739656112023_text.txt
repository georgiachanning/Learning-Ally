Vision Statement
 
S
tallions strive for their best because every day we are prepared for success.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
To develop and prepare every Saroyan Stallion Student to persevere in the accomplishment of their 
dreams, which will enable them to be prepared for success in college, career, and community in 
the 21st Century.
 
 
William Saroyan 
Elementary has been serving families in the northwest Fresno community since 
1994; it was the first school built on the northern border of Central Unified School District. William 
Saroyan Elementary was named after the great author William Saroyan.
 
 
Over t
he past 20 years, the school has seen an increase in the growth of the socioeconomic 
disadvantaged and free and reduced sub
-
groups. Over the past two years, the Free and Reduced 
sub
-
group has increased by over 5% and is currently over 70%. Saroyan has main
tained steady 
academic achievement throughout these changes. Saroyan has been consistently one of the top
-
performing schools in both Math and ELA in the district as well as to similar schools in the state.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Cali
fornia is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data 
reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/t
a/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community mem
bers should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Central Unified Schools maintain current and standards
-
aligned instructional materi
als in good repair, for all students. Materials are locally adopted and 
reflect programs currently approved by the State Board of Education. All materials currently adopted reflect the most recent 
SBE adoptions and support 
the current California Frameworks
.
 
 
Every student, including English Learners, Special Education, and other special populations have their own textbook. In the c
ase of class sets, those sets 
augment individual texts that have been issued to individual students. These class sets are made b
ased on a commitment of the district administration 
and the governing board and are not the product of any state requirement.
 
 
All instructional materials are subject to a school and district review process. Materials may be piloted and all 
materials that are selected and 
recommended for local adoption are reviewed by teachers, administration, and any parents who wish to review the materials. Th
e Central Unified Board 
of Trustees reviews and adopt based on the recommendation of the district a
doption committees and Educational Services.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priorit
y 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessme
nts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards,
 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the 
University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

cipation of parents. 
Saroyan also hosts meetings to build a community of read
ers by teaching parents how to support their students at home. We also offer a series of free 
family and parenting classes through ValleyPBS to support families to better understand how to support their students when le
arning how to read, write, 
practice m

-
emotional support. The classes offered are selected by School Site Council and the English Learners Advisory 
Committee compiled of parents and staff. Translation and interpretations of services are provided as well as daycare.

through community college, to have written emergency response plans which will be reviewed annually by the local governing bo
ard. The safe school 
plan was reviewed with the staff on August 25, 2019.
 
 
The plan was developed in cooperation with state, county, city, and district civil emergency response staff, and they have ap
proved it. Cooperation with 
these agencies is essential in times of emergency
. The plan is devoted to the welfare and safety of the students at Saroyan during school hours. It includes 
a procedure whereby the school could be used, under disaster conditions, as a community resource for the care of people. The 
major objectives of 
eme
rgency response procedures are to save lives and protect property in the event of a disaster. The School Safety Plan has been
 
developed with these 
objectives in mind.  Drills are held on a regular basis.  Two
-
way radios and surveillance cameras have been p
rovided.

The primary 
focus of staff development at Saroyan is to build the capacity of the adults to deliver instruction using best practices guid
ed by common core 
state standards that improve the learning of every student and closes the achievement gap. Professional developme
nt (PD) consists of weekly early 
dismissal days for TK
-
6 students. This time is used for site
-
level meetings, district
-
wide grade
-
level meetings, professional development, and outside 
presenters. All grade
-
level teams participate in district
-
wide training 
with their grade level colleagues as needed for increasing proficiency and 
understanding of curriculum and best practices. Site staff training is focused around further development of Professional Lea
rning Communities (PLCs), 
that focuses on the analysis o
f student learning results and how to the use of student learning results to guide instruction, as well as increasing the use
 
of strategies and resources specific to increasing vocabulary development and analysis of data by students. Site professional
 
deve
lopment is also focused 
on reading and writing with the goal of improving each student's ability to read by at least one reading level each year. Tra
ining to practice is insured 
through frequent classroom observations and feedback.
 
 
Teachers in grades TK 
-
 
3 are being provided specific training on guided reading and small group instruction. Teachers in grades 4 
-

with additional training for NGSS and the integration of the new curriculum from Discovery Ed. There is also a focus TK
