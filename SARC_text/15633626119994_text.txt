By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Berkshire provides a safe and clean environment for 
learning. A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the 
District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are maintained to a degree of adequacy that provides for a good 
education. Ongoing repairs and modifications to the physical plant exceed
 
California Building and Safety Codes. The 

grounds are well lit, and the perimeter of the school facility is fenced for student protection 
and safety. A team of 
custodians ensures classrooms and campus grounds are kept clean and safe. The restrooms are cleaned, sanitized, and 
secured at the end of each school day, with 100% of the toilets in operating conditions. As outlined in our Safe Schoo
ls 
Plan, the safety committee has addressed concerns for the safe arrival and dismissal of our students. Staff receives training
 
in emergency protocol and CPR. Identifying tags are issued to volunteers and other visitors as they register in our office. 
The
 
gates on the perimeter of the school playground are locked during school hours, and staff members are trained to 
activate lockdown procedures in the event of an emergency. Our positive partnership with local law enforcement is 
evident in their quick respo
nse time when concerns arise. Designated staff members carefully supervise students on the 
playground and in the cafeteria. Grounds and playground equipment are inspected regularly for potential hazards. The 
District provides on
-
going training in CPR/First
 
Aid as part of its staff development program. Fire and disaster drills occur 
quarterly, and a complete school site disaster plan has been prepared and is in place and available for public review. 
Scheduled certificated supervision of students begins offic
ially at 7:45 a.m. when the school opens and supervision ends 
at 3:10 p.m.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

-
esteem program is to 
provide students with opportunities to learn self
-
discipline through a system of consistent rewards and consequences for 
their behavior. 
 
Berkshire Elementary believes students who develop a sense of personal responsibility will mature both 
academically and emotionally.  Parents and students are informed of discipline policies at the beginning of each school 
year through classroom orientati
on as well as individual parent
-
student handbooks.
 
 
Students with excessive tardies, truancies, or unexcused absences are subject to disciplinary action, including mandatory 

trict has established an Independent 
Study Program for students who must be absent from school due to illness for an extended period.
 
 
Berkshire establishes guidelines to provide students with a meaningful, productive, and enjoyable school experience. We 
a
re a PBIS school, and appropriate behavior is encouraged through praise and motivational incentives as well as assertive 
discipline and conflict resolution tools to further develop personal growth.  Expulsions occur only when required by law 
or when all ot
her alternatives are exhausted.
 
 
Berkshire's School Safety Plan was reviewed and approved by the School Site Council at our October 28th, 2019 meeting.   
The Safety Plan includes respecting the diversity of our population as well as plans to maintain the p
hysical environment 
and safety practices for our staff and students.

tside funding sources.
 
 
The types of services funded with categorical funds include: 
 
 
Title I 
 
 
Title I, Part A (Title I) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, (ESEA) provides financial assistance to local 
educational agencies (LEAs) and schools 
with high numbers or high percentages of children from low
-
income families to 
help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards. Title I is designed to help students served by the 
program to achieve proficiency on challenging State ac
ademic achievement standards. Title I schools with percentages of 
students from low
-
income families of at least 40 percent may use Title I funds, along with other Federal, State, and local 
funds, to operate a "school wide program" to upgrade the instructio
nal program for the whole school. Based on an analysis 
of student achievement data done be the school site, Title I resources may be used for professional development, 
supplemental instruction and intervention, parental involvement, personalization and sup
port for students with at
-
risk 
behaviors. Targeted assistance schools design, in consultation with parents, staff, and district staff, an instructional 
program to meet the needs of specifically identified students who are failing, or most at risk of failin
g, to meet the State's 
challenging academic achievement standards . Both school wide and targeted assistance programs must use instructional 
strategies based on scientifically based research and implement parental involvement activities.
