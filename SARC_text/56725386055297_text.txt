School Description
 
Principal's Message
 
 
At Norma Harrington School, we strive for academic excellence for all students.  We have 
established an educational program in which we emphasize a strong foundation in academics based 
on the California Common Core Standards, while providing a safe, nurtur
ing environment because 
we believe students are most successful when they feel comfortable and want to be at school 
everyday. Harrington employs a faculty of professional, dedicated teachers and support staff, that 
go above and beyond in order to meet the 
needs of our community.
 
 
With a staff of this quality, children are afforded a classroom environment where they can prosper 
and strive to reach their highest potential. We encourage parents to be involved in the schooling 
of their children and assist by pr
oviding them the skills and information needed to help their 
children. We believe that  students thrive when parents and school work together to properly equip 
them to achieve success in our complex and competitive society. Additionally, this year we began
 
a biliteracy program in kindergarten. We believe that all students capable of becoming bilingual, 
biliterate, and biclultural.
 
 
Realizing the critical importance of an education firmly grounded in preparing our students for 
middle school and beyond, we em
brace and incorporate the use of technology as well as the 
introduction of focus strands in Environmental Science, Music and the Arts. Concurrently, we also 
maintain a student
-
centered after
-

soc
ial, emotional and intellectual needs are equally important. Our schools social and emotional 
well being is supported by a School Psychologist, a School Counselor and Outreach Specialist.
 
 
Implementation of our school mission is made possible by the suppor
t staff employed to augment 
our program. Norma Harrington enjoys the support of a full time Computer Technician, one 
Elementary Support Teacher who teaches music to our 1st through 5th grades, one intervention 
support provider that support our mixed ages c
lasses as well as support reading and math 
intervention for grades 1 through 5. Additionally, we have para educator support in kindergarten 
and 1st grade along with a reading specialist.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required b
y state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are 
required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For 
more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact 
the school principal or the 
district office.

State Priority: Parental 
Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunit
ies for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents are encouraged to volunteer at the school and participate on the School Site Council, English Language Advisory Counc
il, and PTA.  The Harrington 
PTA is active at our school with fundraisers and mo
nthly meetings, as well as providing volunteers to support various grade
-
level activities and field trips.  
Our PTA is very supportive of enrichment activities in and out of the classroom.
 
 
The Harrington SSC is made up of very dedicated parents and staff.
  
We collaborate on school business, and constantly review and update our SPSA, 
ensuring that the best possible program is offered to our students. Our ELAC is very active in learning about language acquis
ition and literacy support.  A 
group of 20
-
30 paren
ts attend our monthly meeting which include training on various topics to ensure their ability to be partners in their studen
ts 
education.
 
 
This year's school plan includes increasing the number and variety of parent workshops that include, health, nutriti
on, social development, mental health, 
behavioral supports, academic proficiency, and literacy support. The principal has initiated a monthly "chat" that is unstruc
tured and allows for parents 
to freely ask questions and have concerns voiced in a safe, sup
portive environment. The principal has begun texting parents regarding important 
information in order to increase parent communication.
 
 
Our PTA works collaboratively with our school in order to encourage parent participation at events after school as well
 
as for our student recognition 
ceremonies. This year, we re
-
structured our awards program and have more students receiving awards for every trimester. Additionally, student that 
met or exceeded standard on the CAASPP assessment were invited with their par
ents to a special student recognition event. We believe celebrating 
student achievement is a great way to encourage parents to become involved in their child's educational journey.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Harrington School. All 

at all times. Supervision is provided to ensure the safety of each student before school, during breaks, at lunch and after s
chool. Supervision is a 
responsibility shared among Cam
pus Assistants, teachers and the principal.  The additional funding from LCAP allowed our Campus Assistants to increase 
the number of hours that each works per day.
 
 
To safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, a comprehensive School Site Safety Plan
 
has been developed by the PBIS/Safety Committee. The Safety 
Plan is updated annually in the fall; all revisions and updates are reviewed with the staff. Key elements of the Safety Plan 
focus on the visitor policy, 
emergency materials, and evacuation proce
dures.  A review of school safety in general is a regular item at our staff meetings.
 
 
The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake stan
dards. Safety drills are held 
regularly; fir
e drills are held monthly, earthquake drills are held twice a year, and intruder/secure campus drills are held periodically i
n coordination with 
our School Resource Officer.
