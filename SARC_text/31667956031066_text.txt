About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to 
publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to pre
pare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consis
tent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more informatio
n about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school prin
cipal or the 
district office.

Colfax Elementary School District held a Public Hearing in September of 2018, and determined that each school within the dist
rict has sufficient and good 
quality textbooks, instr
uctional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students
, 
including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in co
re subjects for use in the 
classroom and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the Californi
a Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials
 
approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers and 
a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommende
d materials are 
available for parent examination at the district pr
ior to adoption. The table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school 
district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Colfax Elementary greatly benefits from its supportive parents. The school is 
thankful to have parent volunteers who volunteer in the classroom or donate 
their time and resources for special projects and/or fundraising. Parents are also welcome to join the School Site Council, L
CAP Committee and the Parent 
Teachers Association (PTA)
.   Classroom volunteers and field trip drivers are required to have a current TB test on file and have their fingerprinting 
done 
and cleared. Parents play a large role in our monthly student recognition, and trimester academic and attendance award recogn
i
tion.  Parents and 
community members are trained to assist in helping students in reading and througout the classroom.  A parent survey is condu
cted each year to gather 
important perception data for school improvement purposes.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary respo
nsibility of Colfax Elementary School District. Students are supervised before school by paraeducators 
and teachers and after school by credentialed teachers. Paraeducators and other classified staff supervise students during lu
nch. Teachers also help with
 
supervision during lunch and break periods. Student Conflict Managers are trained and support students with problem solving d
uring recess and lunch.  
There is a designated area for student drop off and pick up. Visitors must check in at the front office, 

before leaving.
 
 
The school is  in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake sta
ndards. The School Site Safety 
Plan is reviewed and updated ann
ually by the School Site Council, which consists of the principal, certificated and classified staff members, and parents 
from the school community. It is also approved by our governing board annually.  Revisions are communicated to the both the c
lassified
 
and certificated 

cific goals for improving school 
safety and climate. Fire, disaster, and intruder drills are conducted on a regul
ar basis throughout the school year.  The school works with local agencies 
such as Cal Fire and Placer County Sheriff on the safety plan and has a school resource officer assigned to the school. We re

Ongoing 
professional development occurs at staff meetings and professional learning communities on a regular basis. A constructive ev
aluation process 
promotes quality instruction and is a fundamental element in a sound educational program. Evaluations and formal o
bservations are designed to 

eachers are evaluated 
annually and tenured teachers are evaluated every other year. Evaluations are con
ducted by the principal who has been trained and certified for 
competency to perform teacher evaluations. Teachers are evaluated on the following criteria: planning and preparation, the cl
assroom environment, 
instruction, and professional responsibilities.
 
 
Teachers attend professional development workshops and classes throughout the year. In addition, each teacher has 100 minutes
 
per week of release 
time for collaboration and planning, as well as one hour per week for meeting as a Professional Learning Com
munity. Staff meetings are weekly and 
include ongoing professional development provided by outside providers as well as our own staff. Minimum days are also built 
into the calendar and 
provide opporunity for professional development.
