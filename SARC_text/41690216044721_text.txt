Vision of the San Carlos School District:
 
The San Carlos School District shall provide an innovative and engaging learning experience that 
fosters the development of the Whole Child to ensure all students are well 
prepared for success in 
the 21st Century, as evidenced by:
 
1.
 
Reaching their highest academic, social, emotional, intellectual, and physical potential; 
and
 
2.
 
Becoming problem solvers, critical thinkers, risk
-
takers, designers, collaborators, and 
innovators; and
 
3.
 
Developing into contributing, empathic citizens and leaders who are responsible stewards 
of their world and care about equity and justice, both locally and worldwide
 
 
School Description and Profile:
 
Established in 1949, Arundel School is lo
cated between Phelps and Arundel Road. The school is 
both ethnically and socioeconomically diverse. Arundel was recognized for its outstanding 
programs as a 1998 California Distinguished School. In June 2000, Arundel School became a 
dependent charter of th
e San Carlos School District with a focus on educating the '"whole child" 
and recognizing the uniqueness of individuals.
 
 
The Arundel school culture is centered on our students. The staff works closely with a supportive 
volunteer base to meet students' div
erse needs. Arundel works collaboratively to create and 
maintain a positive learning environment. This is done in part with a look towards life skills, such as 
honesty and friendship. Additionally, the staff of Arundel collaborates to support the academic 
needs of each student.
 
 
Arundel School promotes educational excellence for all students. In partnership with staff, parents 
and community, we create an environment where students take ownership of their learning in 
order to function as creative, productive
 
citizens within a community of learners. During the 2018
-
19 school year, Arundel Elementary School had 473 students enrolled in kindergarten through 
fourth grade.
 
 
Principal's Message
 
Arundel School is a unique learning environment that embraces community
 
as a cornerstone of 
each child's educational experience. We work with parents and families as partners in the 
educational journey of each child. Children are encouraged to take risks, explore and innovate in 
the classrooms as well as take a leadership rol
e in making a positive impact in the community 
around them. Project Based Learning is taking hold in all classrooms through grade level projects 
and collaborations between individual teachers. Reading and writing are taught through a 
workshop approach in r
esponse to new and rigorous common core standards. A new common core 
aligned math curriculum has just been adopted.  We work together to foster each child's 
independence, their love of learning and their sense of belonging in the community. We have an 
acti
ve and caring parent community as well as the support of a forward
-
thinking school board, an 
innovative and creative Strategic Plan and a progressive and supportive district office staff. We have 
the support of the community through the San Carlos Educatio
n Foundation and our local PTA that 
help to keep essential programs alive such as our music program, literacy, and technology 
associates, a school counselor, the PE program, field trips, technology and more. Our teachers are 
highly qualified, caring and de
dicated to making sure that each and every child's needs are met.  It 
is my privilege and honor to be part of such an innovative and caring community.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
San Carlos School District holds a public hearing annually determine that each school within the dis
trict has sufficient and good quality textbooks. 
instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All stu
dents, including English learners, 
are given their own individual instructional ma
terials in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials 
are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education and in alignment with the development of
 
State Standards and 
Fram
eworks, making the textbooks and materials used in the school the most currently available. As part of the adoption process, 
materials are piloted 
and selected by a selection committee composed primarily of teachers and including other staff as necessary. 
When materials are being recommended 
for adoption, they are made available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption and/or parents are invi
ted to provide input via other 
means. Recommendations from the committee are then brought to t
he Board for adoption.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
At Arundel, we encourage parental involvement in numerous areas and are fortunate that the majority of our parents seek out o
pportunities to 
participate. Each fall, we hold a Back
-
to
-
School Night to introduce parents 
to the school year and engage volunteers. To welcome our youngest families, 
we conduct two visitation dates in January as well as an orientation in April targeted at TK and Kindergarten families.
 
 
Parents are present in classrooms and around the campus eve
ry day. Our parents volunteer in the classroom to assist in preparation or work with small 
groups. Parents also serve as chaperones and drivers on field trips, help with yard supervision at recess and lunchtime and p
articipate in the Arundel 
PTA, School Si
te Council and a variety of committees and workgroups.
 
 
The PTA holds Community Beautification Days, an annual Fun Run Event, Staff Luncheons, an annual Heritage Fair, Science Night
, Family Movie Nights as 
well as Book Fairs in the fall and spring. The PTA
 
provides many enrichment opportunities for students and holds evening community
-
building events 
throughout the year. Many of our parents also serve as liaisons to the larger San Carlos School District community. We have p
arent representatives 
involved in 
the PTA Coordinating Council, Healthy Cities Tutoring, SCEF Spring Gala Committee and the San Carlos Educational Foundation.
 
 
Our Weekly Newsletter, The Arundel Knightly News, provides a consistent stream of information that weaves us together with co
mmon 
goals that are 
aimed at the whole child.

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Arundel Elementary. The school is always in compliance with all laws, ru
les, and regulations pertaining 
to hazardous materials and state 
earthquake standards. The School Site Safety plan is reviewed and updated annually in the fall by the School Safety 
Committee, Staff and School Site Council. All revisions are communicated to both the classified and certificated staff. The s
chool's disaste
r preparedness 
plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. The San Mateo County's recommended Big Five Safe
ty Protocols are practiced 
on a regular basis throughout the school year and all five drills are held annually. Stud
ents are supervised before school, during lunch and after school 
by staff. Peacemakers are supervised and led by our full
-
time school counselor and help fellow classmates solve conflicts during lunch and break periods.  
Arundel also has paid yard superviso
rs at lunchtimes as well as volunteers to assist with supervision.

ual school sites to 
administrators, teachers, and classified staff.  The district offers two full
