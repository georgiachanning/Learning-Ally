On

2019,
 
the
 
Orcutt
 
Union

held

the
 
extent

have
 
been
 
provided
 
to

The
 
Board
 
of
 
Education
 
adopted
 
Resolution
 
No.
 
2
 
which
 
certifies
 
as
 
required
 
by
 
Education
 
Code
 
§60119
 
(1)
 
that
 
textbooks
 
and
 
instructional
 
materials
 
were
 
provided
 
to
 
all
 
students,
 
including
 
English
 
learners,
 
in
 
the
 
district
 
to
 
the
 
extent
 
that
 
each
 
pupil
 
has
 
a
 
textbook
 
or
 
instructional
 
materials,
 
or
 
both,
 
to
 
use
 
in
 
class
 
and
 
to
 
take
 
home,
 
and
 
(2)
 
sufficient
 
textbooks
 
and
 
instructional
 
materials
 
were
 
provided
 
to
 
each
 
student,
 
including
 
English
 
learners,
 
that
 
are
 
aligned
 
to
 
the
 
academic
 
content
 
standards
 
and
 
consistent

the

the

In
 
addition
 
to
 
core

the

Orcutt
 
Union
 
Elementary
 
did
 
not
 
offer
 
visual/performing

therefore
 
did

Plan
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
The
 
Orcutt
 
Academy
 
maintains
 
separate
 
Safe
 
Schools
 
Plans
 
for
 
its
 
K-8
 
and
 
high
 
school
 
campuses.
  
All
 
emergency
 
notebooks
 
and
 
backpacks
 
were
 
updated
 
or
 
replenished
 
and
 
distributed
 
to
 
every
 
classroom
 
at
 
that
 
time.
  
An
 
emergency
 
exit
 
map
 
is
 
posted
 
in
 
every
 
room,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
in
 
the
 
"red"
 
emergency
 
binders.
  
Every
 
faculty
 
member
 
has
 
been
 
assigned
 
a
 
responsibility
 
on
 
the
 
Emergency
 
Operations
 
Center
 
(EOC)
 
using
 
SEMS.
  
Our
 
plan
 
details
 
procedures
 
for
 
the
 
following
 
situations:
  
Drills,
 
Lockdowns,
 
Bomb
 
Threats,
 
Campus
 
Unrest,
 
Chemical
 
Accidents,
 
Earthquakes,
 
fire,
 
Earthquakes,
 
and
 
Gas
 
Leaks.
  
The
 
school
 
has
 
regular
 
practice
 
drills
 
to
 
insure
 
all
 
stakeholders
 
know
 
what
 
to
 
do
 
in
 
an
 
emergency.
 
 
Orcutt
 
Academy
 
places
 
a
 
high
 
priority
 
on
 
maintaining
 
a
 
safe
 
and
 
supportive
 
campus
 
environment.
  
The
 
K-8
 
campus
 
has
 
a
 
part-time
 
nutrition
 
and
 
lunch
 
supervisor.
  
The
 
high
 
school
 
campus
 
has
 
two
 
part-time
 
nutrition
 
and
 
lunch
 
supervisors
 
who
 
are
 
accompanied
 
by
 
the
 
principal,
 
the
 
school
 
counselor,
 
and
 
a
 
rotating
 
schedule
 
of
 
faculty
 
while
 
on
 
duty.
 
The
 
Orcutt
 
Academy
 
Student
 
Handbook
 
clearly
 
outlines
 
behavior
 
expectations
 
and
 
the
 
consequences
 
for
 
violations.
  
The
 
book
 
is
 
reviewed
 
and
 
updated
 
annually
 
by
 
principals
 
and
 
staff
 
and
 
subsequently
 
approved
 
by
 
the
 
School
 
Advisory
 
Council.
