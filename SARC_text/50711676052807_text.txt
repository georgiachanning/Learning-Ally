By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Mission: All students and staff will learn at the maximum academic level possible.
 
 
Vision: Roosevelt Junior High will be the highest performing junior high in Stanislaus County. It will be a
 
safe environment, 
free of disciplinary distractions, and composed of students and staff who are encouraging and positive.
 
 
School Description:
 
 
The student population is very diverse, ethnically and linguistically.  Currently Roosevelt student population 
is 57% 
Hispanic, 24% White, 2% African American, and the remaining 17% is made up of Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, 
and two or more races.  Over 201 students at Roosevelt are designated English Learners.  Roosevelt serves the 

e only been in the United States 4 years or less, and long term EL students who have been in the 
US longer than 4 years.  Academic Language Development classes , or ALD, are offered to support our long term English 
Language Learners.  To support the newcom
ers for the entire district, the Language Institute was developed.  The 
Language Institute is intensive language acquisition classes that also incorporate the core subject material.  The students 
have an ELD class (English Language Development), acculturat
ion, and Spanish for Spanish Speaker.  The students are out 
with the general education students for math, science, history and PE.
 
 
For our general education students who need extra help, Roosevelt  has developed math support classes aligned with the 
new S
wun Curriculum.  The students in these classes have an extra math class in place of their elective.  SFor struggling 
readers,  Read 180 is offered.  This is a computer
-
based class that is proven to bring students reading level up multiple 
grade levels if t
hey are behind.
 
 
In addition to general education students, there are four special day classes, one is a severely handicapped
 
class, two are 
learning handicapped classes, and one is for students who are limited learning handicapped. All of the special education 
classes have credentialed teachers along with multiple instructional para professionals to support the students.
 
Roose
velt also offers a complete GATE/Honors program for students who show potential for moving on to advanced 
placement classes in high school. Elective choices include Band, chorus, string orchestra, art, computers, Robotics, and 
Spanish.  Roosevelt has made 
many strides to keep up with the technology movements  in our society.  In order to keep 
up with the needs of these many portable devices the school has wireless capabilities throughout and all student are 
provided with a laptop to utilize during the schoo
l years. Additionally, both English Language Arts and Social Science have 
adopted digital curriculum. Science and Math have hybrid curriculum.
 
Roosevelt has a dedicated staff of both veteran and newer teachers.  They do everything they can to make sure the
 
students are learning.  After school tutoring is offered Monday through Thursday for any students.  There are also a variety 
of after school clubs for students to become involved with.  For a more committed after school experience Roosevelt also 
houses a 
free After School Program where more than 120 students attend up to 6:00 P.M.  Students have the opportunity 
to do homework and become involved in many activities ranging from sports to cooking club.
 
Roosevelt prides itself in our academics.  Students are 
rewarded as much as possible for their hard work and dedication.  
With our Renaissance program students with good grades and good behavior in all of their classes are rewarded.  Staff 
and students both enjoy being at Roosevelt. A lot of importance is place
d on students being Respectful, Kind, and Honest. 
These are the foundational character traits of Roosevelt's PBIS program.

s calculated by taking the total 
number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., 
achieved Level 3
-
Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

) appear in the table 
when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistic
al 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test 
whether they received a score or not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

Professional development in MCS is data driven using research
-
based best practices to ensure our students receive 
guaranteed and viable curriculum in every grade, in every school.    We use formative and summative data to drive our 
instructional decisions 
and focus for professional development.  To this end, we utilize multiple structures  to provide 
high
-
quality professional development to our staff including:  summer training, preservice
-
days, district wide professional 
development days, after school work
shops, Saturday workshops, substitute
-
release days, instructional coaching, a BTSA 
and PAR program,  and most recently a 0.5% compensation package for those who choose to complete an extra 6 hours 
of professional development.
 
 
MCS has prioritized our focus
 
on mathematics, literacy across grades and content areas, collaboration, welcoming 
schools/customer service, and building our capacity as professionals.  This has been in addition to the needed training in 
new adoptions, curriculum and standard updates an
d the like.  The professional development is sustained through site 
administration, district and site level instructional coaches, and intervention specialists.  In the 2019
-
202 academic year, 
a new division was also created in order to increase the qualit
y and quantity of professional development provided to 
classified, certificated, and managers alike.
