By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parent involvement is strongly encouraged at Mercey Springs Elementary. Parents are an important part of the team and 
are invited to visit and volunteer in classrooms. In addition, parents can participate in school activities, serve in clubs, 
serve on comm
ittees, and participate in parenting classes/workshops. Working cooperatively is the key to student success. 
Through School Site Council, ELAC and Parent Club, parents take an active role in the academic success of our students.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
Mercey Springs Elementary is committed to providing students with a safe learning 
environment. A School Safety 
Committee will be developed to meets on a yearly basis to review safety issues and recommend improvements. Another 
way we obtain parent input on school safety is through ELAC, SSC, the community, and the California Healthy Kids
 
Survey 
which is given every two years.
 
 
Our school campus is maintained by four custodians, as well as District grounds and maintenance crews. The school is 
inspected on an ongoing basis for safety hazards and repairs are made as required.
 
 
The students a
nd staff participate in maintaining a clean and safe environment by putting litter in its place and keeping 
the classrooms neat and hazard free. In addition, fire and disaster drills are held regularly. Mercey Springs Elementary has 
a School Disaster Plan 
which is included in our District Safety Plan. The assistant principal, Mrs. Mirna Carter, is in charge 
of the school safety binder.
