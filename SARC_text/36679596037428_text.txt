Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Valley Elementary School is  committed to providing a safe learning/working environment. During school hours the 
entrance is secured to ensure visitors check in with the front office. All visitors are required to sign in and wear a visito
r 
badge during the
ir stay. Visitors will be allowed on campus after 8:30 AM to ensure safety.  While we welcome visits by 
parents and community members, anyone wishing to be on campus during school hours must notify the staff ahead of 
time and, if volunteering with students
, follow district/board guidelines/procedures. During lunch, breaks, and before and 
after school, yard duty aides, the Principal, teachers, and staff supervise students and monitor the campus.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan provides students and sta
ff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning 
environment including requirements of SB 187: such as child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine, 
and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsion; notification to teachers; 
sexual harassment policy; provision 
of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and school employees to and from school; safe and 
orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures. The school evaluates and updates the
 
plan annually.  Safety 
procedures, including elements of the School Safety Plan, are reviewed annually with school staff at the beginning of each 
school year and at monthly Safety Committee meetings. District safety personnel and committee meetings provid
e 
additional support to the school. In addition, the district and school have a positive partnership with the City of Yucaipa 
and the Yucaipa Sheriff's Department through School
-
Police liaison meetings, Operation Clean Sweep program, and the 
district's Sch
ool Resource Officer.
