About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the Smarter Balanced 
Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for En
glish language 
arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students may participate in the 
administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards 
[CCSS] for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the Universi
ty of California and 
the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs of study

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Invo
lvement (School Year 2019
-

Parent involvement is fundamental to the success of Steinbeck Elementary students. We encourage parents to participate in all
 
activities and to attend 
site parent meetings, including Parenting Partners, School Site Council, Ti
tle 1, District Advisory Committee, and Parent Teacher Organization meetings 
(PTO). Steinbeck parents routinely participate in District committees and task forces.  Parents of students in Special Educat
ion are an active part in the 
development and implemen
tation of their child's Individual Education Program.  Parents are also invited to attend our awards assemblies which recogni
ze 
students with outstanding achievements at the end of each trimester.  Parents are always welcomed and encouraged to volunteer
 
in
 
classrooms and on 
campus, and as chaperones on grade
-
level field trips.
 
 
In conjunction with special Parent Education offerings hosted by the school, parents are strongly encouraged to attend Parent
-
Teacher Conferences (fall 
and spring), Back
-
to
-
School Ni
ght in the fall, Open House in the spring, and math, reading and science family nights hosted by the school.
 
 
Through their fund
-
raising efforts, the PTO supports a full
-
time art teacher for art/music instruction in Transitional Kindergarten through sixth 
grades. 
The PTO offers a variety of enjoyable student activities such as the Fall Festival, a Holiday Craft Boutique and Workshop, fa
ll and spring book fairs, an 
airplane contest,  movie nights, Father
-
Daughter and Mother
-
Son Dances, and the Spring Art Sho
w. Each of these events is either a wonderful fund
-
raiser 
or community outreach which serve to bring the community together! Students in third through sixth grades participate in Dist
rict
-
sponsored volleyball, 
football, basketball, and soccer teams.  Paren
ts participate and support our boys and girls in these endeavors through coaching and ardent participation. 
For parent involvement opportunities, please contact Mr. Jer J. Soriano, Principal at (831) 753
