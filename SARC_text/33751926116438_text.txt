By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent 
Year)
 
 
Jackson Elementary School campus houses:
 
 
41 Regular Education classrooms (22 permanent in main  building)
 
 
12 portables on permanent foundations which house the SDC Preschool
 
 
2 Portables on temporary foundations
 
 
1 Resource Specialist 
Program rooms
 
 
1 Media Center
 
 
1 Computer Lab
 
 
1 Speech Classroom
 
 
1 Psychologist's Office
 
 
1 Creative Arts Center
 
 
1 Conference Room
 
 
TVUSD's Maintenance and Operations division works diligently to ensure our facilities are clean and safe for students, 
te
achers and staff. The district follows a comprehensive preventive and deferred maintenance program to offset costly 
repairs and minimize disruptions to the instructional program.
 
 
Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and bathrooms are c
lean and well maintained. Jackson 
Elementary has one full time lead custodian during school hours, and a night crew that comes in and cleans the entire 
facility after school hours. In addition, between two and three times a year the carpets at each site ar
e steam cleaned.
 
 
In order to respond to work requests in a timely manner, the district utilizes an electronic work order system. When a site 
secretary, custodian or administrator has a request, they can put it into the system directly. This makes for a mo
re time 
efficient processing of work orders.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Stat
ewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] f
or English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are l
inked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Califor
nia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Helen Hunt Jackson Elementary School is a better place because of parent involvement. Volunteers are an integral part of 
our school, from lesson preparation, tutoring, lunchtime activities and supporting classroom instruction.  Their presence 
throughout th
e day is tangible and evident on campus as a positive factor in creating high academic achievement and a 
caring school climate.  Additionally, Jackson staff,  parents and the community share the belief that children should have 
a variety of opportunities b
eyond the regular school curriculum.  Our site is the focal point for many of these activities 
including music, science, visual arts and martial arts that reinforce the unity of families and curricular topics.
 
 
Parent involvement is communicated through ou
r PTA recruitment held throughout the school year, our school 
newsletter, Remind App, and classroom websites. Parents may sign up as a volunteer through their child's classroom 
teacher.  Helen Hunt Jackson Elementary welcomes any parent who would like to v
olunteer at the school. Any parent who 
volunteers more than one day during the school year must have a current TB negative test on file, per district policy, 
before they volunteer.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School safety is a high priority for our school and district. Our school has a comprehensive School Safety Plan. Additional 
School Safety Training will be held on campus. The School Safety Plan covers topics such as disaster response, safe ingress 
and egre
ss and ensuring a safe and orderly environment. Additionally, the plan includes data on suspensions and 
expulsions as well as school and district crime data.
 
 
Our school is a closed campus that is fully enclosed by fencing. School visitors and volunteers a
re required to sign in at the 
front office prior to entering campus. In instances of emergency, we use an automated telephone system to contact 
parents with pertinent information.
 
 
To better prepare our teachers, students and staff for emergencies, our sch
ools conducts fire and earthquake drills 
regularly throughout the school year. Education Code mandates that all elementary and middle schools hold a fire drill 
each month they are in session as well as an earthquake drill at least four times during the sch
ool year.

The Temecula Valley Unified School District is committed to ensuring that each and every child in its care receives a 
rigorous, multifaceted educational experience preparing them for the demands of college and career.
 
 
TVUSD teachers engage in active staff
 
development throughout the year by attending:
 
 
In
-
District training sessions provided by staff and consultants.
 
 
Site
-
based training sessions presented during staff meetings and committee/grade level meetings.
 
 
One on one training provided during 
formal observations and post observation conferences.
 
 
Staff members are sent to national and state conferences to fine
-
tune instructional practices in specific areas.
 
 
Teachers with specialized training are given opportunities to train their peers, and pr
ovide instructional support as teacher 
leaders.
 
 
Standards Based Instruction
 
 
Staff development focuses on implementing the New State Standards and state frameworks in English
-
Language Arts, 
Science, social science, and Math, K
-
12. Routine district 
sessions bring teacher leaders and principals together to devise 
and refine the curriculum and assessments. Teams began by identifying priority and supporting standards, grouping the 
standards into units of instruction, and crafting common interim and summ
ative assessments, developing scoring rubrics, 
and discussing sound grading practices for each course/grade. Leaders return to sites to facilitate their grade level/course 
teams in reviewing the work, suggesting resources, and providing feedback for the re
finement committees.
 
 
Collaborative Teams
 
 
Teachers are divided into Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) based on content area and grade level. All 
instructional staff participate almost weekly during professional growth time meeting in their PLC grou
ps to align 
curriculum, refine teaching strategies, create assessments, analyze student achievement data and transition to New State 
Standards.
