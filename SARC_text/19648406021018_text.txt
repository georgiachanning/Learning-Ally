School Description
 
Nuffer Elementary School has been serving children and families in the Norwalk community since 


h our School Site Council (SSC), 
English Learners Advisory Committee (ELAC), and the Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) to support 

met.
 
 
During the past four 
years, our school has significantly increased its focus on learning. To keep 
students engaged and achieving at high levels, our teachers use a variety of instructional strategies 
and resources. Through a systematic approach to intervention, our teachers ar
e able to respond 
and provide additional support to those students who are not meeting the standards or are 
struggling with grade level work. With over 140 students who are English Learners, every class 
provides 30
-
minutes of English Language Development (
ELD) every day to help students easily 
access the core curriculum and master the California Common Core Standards. As a result of all of 
these efforts, we have made great gains in student achievement.
 
 
Unique to Nuffer Elementary is our Joan Sander Memoria
l Unit, which is a building dedicated to the 
education and care of students with special needs. Our school is committed to helping all students 
with varying degrees of disabilities to reach their individual learning plan goals.  We believe that all 
student
s can learn and show progress despite the various challenges they may face.
 
 
Regardless of which population of students we serve, Nuffer Elementary provides a safe and 
nurturing environment in which all students can learn and grow. We are committed to prov
iding 
our students with a high
-
quality education; and we are confident that by the time our students 
leave our doors to promote to middle school, we will have prepared the whole child for success.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educatio
nal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, d
ata reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.c
a.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

State Priority: Parental 
Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunit
ies for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We have many ways for parents to participate in the life of our school, and we depend on parents to keep our programs running
 
smoothly. Parents can 
join our School Site Council (SSC), which works with the 
school to help monitor student progress and make program and financial decisions. Parents of 
English learners are encouraged to join our English Learners Advisory Committee (ELAC), which advises the principal and schoo
l about the instructional 
programs tha
t help students with limited English improve their learning and achievement. The Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) organizes 
school
-
wide 
fundraisers to sponsor assemblies, study trips, and special activities such as Red Ribbon Week and College Week.  Paren
t volunteers are always welcome 
to help with special projects in the classrooms and chaperone field trips. We invite all parents to attend Back
-
to
-
School Night in the fall, Open House in 
the spring, and all parent
-
teacher conferences.
 
 
In order to assist p
arents in helping their children, Nuffer Elementary provides free parent workshops on topics such as parenting skills, family
 
reading, 

Parents can contact the Main 
Office for more information about how they can get involved.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rat
es; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
We have a closed campus that is fully fenced. Visitors must enter the school through the reception entrance and sign in at th
e office, where they receive 

wear throughout their stay. The principal, supervision staff, and parent volunteers monitor the school grounds for 30 minutes
 
before 
and after school as well as at all recess and lunch breaks. We revise our School Safety Plan annually; it was last revised 
in February 2019. The plan includes 
procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and inventories of emergency supplies. We make the plan available in the office for 
parents. We share the plan 
with all staff during a school wide staff meeting. We practice emerg
ency drills each month, which include fire, earthquake, and lockdown drills.  The staff 
is trained on emergency preparedness in November and April. Teachers regularly review the rules for safe, responsible behavio
r in school and on the 
playground. We teach
 
and enforce the principles of Character Counts.  The staff also began collaborating on developing our Positive Behavior and 
Instruction Support Plan by aligning Character Counts expectations with our school
-
wide discipline.  We also work closely with Norw
alk Public Safety to 
ensure that students who demonstrate destructive behavior have the opportunity to work with a Safety Officer to redirect thei
r behavior. Nuffer 
Elementary is a No Bully zone.  Teachers are trained to address bullying appropriately, and
 
the topic is continuously addressed with students through 
school assemblies.

Almost two hours of Professional Development time is provided to teachers twice a month.  During this time, teachers have wor
ked with a consultant 
from zSpace and Lightspeed to bring engagement to the classroom. The principal willt visit classrooms regular
ly to provide feedback and reinforcement 
of skills.  In addition to STEAM training, teachers have also received training on instructional shifts that are needed to he
lp students meet California 
Common Core State standards.  With the support of Common Core 
Coaches, teachers learned new math and reading strategies such as 
Launch/Explore/Summarize and Close Reading. On a monthly basis, the principal and the English Language Development (ELD) Coac
h visits classrooms 
to provide feedback on ELD instruction.  This
 
additional ELD support contributed to the schools increase in reclassification rates.  Based on iReady and 
CELDT data, the school will continue to emphasize professional development around Common Core instruction with more focus aro
und reading 
interventio
n and writing development.

Types of Services Funded
 
Nuffer Elementary uses its funds to support and assist student learning.  Funds have been used to supplement professional dev
elopment by having 
teachers attend conferences or seminars to further their education.  The intent of this training is to strengthe
n first good instruction in the classroom so 
that more students may be successful.  For those students who are still struggling, an intervention teacher has been hired to
 
provide 30 minutes of 
intense small group lessons to target deficiencies.  Additional
ly, a technology clerk has been hired to assist students with web
-
based intervention during 
both daily intervention blocks and weekly computer lab visits.  Remaining funds are used to provide sub coverage for teachers
 
who need additional time 
for professio
nal development and for teachers who need to attend student success team meetings to ensure that students receive timely supp
ort.
