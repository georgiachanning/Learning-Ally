for
 
all

Shore

is
 
a
 
Safety
 
First
 
Campus.
 
In
 
collaboration
 
with
 
Contra
 
Costa
 
County
 
and
 
the
 
Bay
 
Point
 
Sheriff's
 
Office,
 
Shore
 
Acres
 
has
 
developed
 
a
 
strict
 
policy
 
for
 
visitor's
 
on
 
campus.
 
All
 
visitors
 
must
 
sign
 
in
 
at
 
the
 
front
 
office
 
to
 
receive
 
a
 
designated
 
visitor's
 
badge
 
and/or
 
visitor's
 
sticker.
 
This
 
badge
 
/
 
sticker
 
must
 
be
 
worn
 
at
 
all
 
times
 
while
 
on
 
campus
 
and
 
then
 
returned
 
to
 
the
 
office
 
upon
 
sign
 
out.
 
Contra
 
Costa
 
County
 
has
 
also
 
installed
 
crosswalk
 
light
 
at
 
the
 
sidewalk
 
for
 
Shore
 
Acres
 
students
 
and
 
families
 
to
 
cross
 
safely.
 
Furthermore,
 
we
 
have
 
implemented
 
additional
 
safety
 
measures
 
which
 
include:
 
new
 
arrival
 
/
 
dismissal
 
procedures
 
(parking
 
lot
 
safety,
 
drop
 
off
 
and
 
pick
 
up
 
zone),
 
walkies
 
talkies
 
in
 
each
 
classroom,
 
all
 
common
 
areas
 
(i.e.
 
staff
 
lounge,
 
cafeteria,
 
Room
 
18,
 
etc.).
 
 
Shore
 
Acres
 
has
 
developed
 
an
 
Emergency
 
Preparedness
 
and
 
Crisis
 
Response
 
Plan.
 
The
 
primary
 
goals
 
of
 
crisis
 
response
 
are:
 
 
1)
 
To
 
prevent
 
a
 
potentially
 
chaotic
 
situation
 
from
 
escalating
 
into
 
a
 
catastrophic
 
event.
 
 
2)
 
Help
 
those
 
affected
 
to
 
return,
 
as
 
quickly
 
as
 
possible,
 
to
 
a
 
normal
 
level
 
of
 
functioning.
 
 
3)
 
Decrease
 
the
 
potential
 
long-term
 
effects
 
of
 
the
 
crisis.
 
 
The
 
Crisis
 
Response
 
Team
 
includes:
 
principal,
 
instructional
 
program
 
specialist,
 
school
 
psychologist,
 
school
 
nurse,
 
teachers,
 
campus
 
/

supervisors,
 
clerical
 
staff,
