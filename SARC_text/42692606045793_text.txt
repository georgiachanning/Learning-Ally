Vision
 
At
 
Patterson
 
Road
 
School
 
we
 
believe
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
limits
 
to
 
the
 
academic
 
potential
 
of
 
our
 
students,
 
and
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
excuses
 
for
 
not
 
maximizing
 
this
 
potential
 
for
 
individuals™
 
success.
 
As
 
staff
 
members
 
of
 
Patterson
 
Road,
 
we
 
are
 
committed
 
to
 
structured
 
collaboration
 
with
 
one
 
another
 
in
 
an
 
effort
 
to
 
meet
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
all
 
students.
  
Every
 
member
 
believes
 
that
 
every
 
student
 
is
 
capable
 
of
 
academic
 
proficiency
 
in
 
all
 
subject
 
areas.
  
We
 
believe
 
collaboration
 
is
 
the
 
vehicle
 
to
 
increase
 
student
 
success
 
and
 
achievement.
  
We
 
will
 
work
 
to
 
neutralize
 
the
 
challenges
 
students
 
bring
 
with
 
them
 
to
 
school.
  
We
 
will
 
practice
 
targeted
 
instruction
 
to
 
build
 
the
 
intellectual
 
ability
 
of
 
our
 
students
 
to
 
do
 
rigorous
 
work.
 
We
 
will
 
address
 
challenges
 
through
 
candid
 
collaboration
 
as
 
a
 
team.
 
We
 
will
 
work
 
together
 
to
 
provide
 
all
 
of
 
our
 
students
 
a
 
school
 
community

Students
 
are
 
recognized
 
for
 
their
 
character,

achievement,
 
and
 
attendance.
 
We
 
believe
 
that
 
the
 
driving
 
force
 
of
 
our
 
school™s
 
success
 
is
 
through
 
the
 
collaboration
 
of
 
our
 
administration,
 
teachers,
 
staff,
 
students,
 
parents,
 
and
 
the
 
community.
