By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description: Golden Hills Elementary Schoo
l, built in 2006, is located south of Oroville and has approximately 300 
students. Golden Hills provides a Title 1 School
-
Wide Program(SWP) in addition to reading Intervention, math 
Intervention, English Language Development, special education, Indian Educ
ation, and library services. Every classroom at 
Golden Hills is considered a smart room, equipped with technology which is used to reach our diverse learners. This 
technology includes a projector, document camera, and amplification systems. In addition, ea
ch student is assigned a 
Chromebook. Every student at Golden Hills receives music education once a week from a music teacher and has the 
opportunity to join a weekly beginning band class. Golden Hills also has a focus on increasing physical fitness for stu
dents 
by holding monthly school
-
wide fitness activities and culminating in an annual two

Golden Hills embraces the Professional Learning Community (PLC) model as well as the Learning For All concept. The 
teaching staff and administrators have developed strategies to teach students of all ability levels, including 
implementation of MTSS (Mult

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The LEA takes great efforts to ensure that all sch
ools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the LEA uses a 
facility inspection tool developed by the State of California OPSC. The results are available at the school office. Below is 
more specific information on the condition of the sc
hool and the efforts made to ensure that students are provided w ith 
a clean, safe, and functional learning environment. Golden Hills w as built in 2006. It has 12 classrooms, a multipurpose 
room, a library, and an administration building. A staff work roo
m is located in the administration building. Student and 
staff restrooms are adequately located throughout the campus and are kept clean and in good w orking order. Golden 
Hills maintains a playground and garden area. The campus is gated and locked when sc
hool is not in session. Parents and 
guests sign in, and out, at the office. LEA maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good 
repair, and working order, are completed in a timely manner. A w ork order process is used to en
sure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. A daytime custodian takes care of the day
-
to
-
day operational needs 
on site, while helping to maintain safety and cleanliness. A night time custodian maintains the cleanliness
 
of the school by 
cleaning the entire facility each night.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parental 
Involvement is an important part of student success. Parents and guardians are given the opportunity to work in 
a mutually supportive and respectful partnership with the school to help their child succeed. We encourage 
parents/guardians to volunteer in the
 
classroom and on field trips, as well as attend Back to School Night, Open House, 
Parent/Teacher Confernece, Title 1 Meetings, Muffins for Moms, Doughnuts for Dads, STEAM night and other family 
events. Golden Hills benefits from an active Parent Teacher G
roup (PTG). The PTG works with the community on various 
fundraisers and supports student activities. Parents are encouraged to serve on the School Site Council (SSC). Parents of 
English Learners (EL students) are encouraged to serve on the Enlgish Learner 
Advisory Committee (ELAC). Parents and 
guardians can support their child's learning environment by monitoring school attendance and homework completion, 
participating in extracurricular activites, volunteering at school, attending SSC meetings, and by plan
ning and participating 
in activities at home that are supportive of classroom instruction.

include: a plan of action for maintaining a safe and orderly environment conducive to learning at the school (i.e. 
assessment of school safety, ide
ntification of strategies and programs that will maintain school safety and campus 
security) and emergency management
 
procedures consistent with the Standardized Emergency Management System 
(SEMS) and the National Incident Management System (NIMS) develope

Key elements of the site Emergency Conditions include: a plan of action for a coordinated school wide response to 
emergencies (i.e. intruder on campus, fire,emergency lockdown, evacuation, etc.). Safety drill
s are held on a regular basis. 
Fire drills are held monthly. Earthquake/disaster and lock down drills are held
 
twice a year. All employees wear ID badges 
and visitors to the campus are required to sign in at the school office and wear a visitor's pass at a
