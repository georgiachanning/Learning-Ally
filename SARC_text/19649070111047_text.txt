Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP]
 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight
 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant co
gnitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or program
s 
of study.

Parent & Community Involvement and Shared Leadership are aligned with our strong belief that parent involvement and 
participation is key to the success of our students. We have three very active groups that aid 
in school decision
-
making: 
the English Language Learners, School Advisory Committee, and the School Site Council.  Our Parent Facilitator regularly 
works with parents and parent groups.   Lopez also has an active PTA which supports school events, incentive
s, and awards.
 
 
In our Parent Center, monthly workshops are offered to our parents.  Topics are determined by parent need.  Workshops 
can be provided by school personnel as well as outside agencies.
 
 
Parents are also sent a weekly update on activities at s
chool.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Students and staff have the right to expect their school to be a safe and comfortable campus that is conducive to learning 
and working. Safety of the students and staff is a primary concern at Ignacio López Elementary,
 
that is why we place a high priority 
on providing a safe, secure environment that we are extremely proud of. Our safety 
procedures are assessed regularly and consist of input from district guidelines, safety consultants and the efforts of our 
own staff and community groups. We believe that we
 
have designed a system that is compliant with all laws, regulations, 
and policies.
 
 
An adopted Safe School Plan incorporates emergency preparedness, student discipline, the components of a safe and 
orderly school environment, suspension/expulsion procedur
es, safety, child abuse reporting
 
procedures, student dress codes, and the student and staff sexual harassment policy. The plan was updated in October of 
2018.  All staff participated in an in
-
service training in October of 2018 to review and discuss the u
pdated school safety 
plan.
