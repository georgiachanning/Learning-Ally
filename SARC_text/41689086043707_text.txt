By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
William H. Crocker Middle School is located in the suburban communi
ty of Hillsborough on the San Francisco Peninsula. 
The residents are primarily professional and business executives. One half of Crocker's students come from families in 
which both parents work outside of the home. The value of education is evidenced by st
rong parental involvement and 
participation in the school community. As of January 2020, the student enrollment was 434 students.
 
 
Students take three years of English, mathematics, science, social studies, world language, and physical education. In 
additi
on, we offer electives in the arts, music, leadership, and technology. Since we believe that we are helping each child 
to build the foundation for the rest of his/her life, we offer more than strong academic training. Our curriculum includes 
skills, techni
ques, and motivation for lifelong learning, excellence, decision making, leadership, and commitment to others. 
We believe in educating the whole child. Every aspect of our program is designed to build a close, caring community in 
which every child and ever
y adult is recognized and respected.
 
 
We embrace the Essential Outcomes by valuing creativity, curiosity, initiative multidisciplinary thinking, innovation and 
empathy.
 
 
Crocker was named as a California Distinguished School in 1982, 1988, 1992, 1994, 1999
, 2003 and 2007. In 1983, 1989, 
1995, and 2004, it was selected as an exemplary school by the National Secondary School Recognition Program. It is one 
of three middle schools in the nation to have been awarded the National Blue Ribbon four times. In 1993, 
Crocker was 
recognized by the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences for its managerial practices which fostered excellence. 
Most recently, Crocker Middle School was recognized by the California Business for Education Excellence in 2014. In 2015 
Cro
cker received the Gold Ribbon Award for their efforts around professional learning teams and collaboration.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Hillsborough City School District inspects all of 
its facilities, both buildings and grounds, yearly to determine if any 

c 
School Instruction. Inspection by Buildings and Grounds pe
rsonnel of the eight emergency facility needs specified in Ed. 
Code 17592.72c was last completed November 2018. The results of this facility survey are available at the District Office.
 
 
In addition, the school district maintains a work order process to en
sure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority. Work orders can be prepared by a staff member, or suggested by a parent. Work orders are 
prioritized district
-
wide by the Supervisor of Buildings and Grounds. The district ma
intenance staff ensures that repairs 
necessary to keep the schools in good working order are completed in a timely manner.
 
 
Currently, all of our schools employ a full
-
time day custodian and a full
-
time night cleaning service. All classrooms, staff 
rooms a
nd all student and staff restrooms are cleaned, and sanitized nightly. Cleaning schedules and duties are monitored 
regularly by the sites and the maintenance department to ensure safe and clean schools. On November 5, 2002, 
Hillsborough voters passed a $66
.8 million Proposition 39 bond measure to finance renovation and new construction 
projects on all four campuses. The District has modernized, renovated, newly constructed and equipped housing to meet 
the instructional needs of the students. These funds, al
ong with $2.8 million in State School Facilities funds, were used to 
upgrade fire, life, safety, and accessibility standards. In addition to facilities, much needed upgrades were made to the 

 
 
A new two
-
story buil
ding on the Crocker campus opened at the start of the 2009
-
10 school year. Funded by Measure B 
bond funds, the building includes a 95
-
seat science lecture hall, television studio, band room, two computer classrooms, 
a regular classroom, restrooms, and stor
age areas. Also completed was the repavement of the black top. Subsequent 
projects included renovation of the art and multi
-
purpose rooms, conversion of the old Lecture Hall into a new Science 
Lab classroom, paving rehabilitation of the driveway and parkin
g lot, conversion of the old band room into a new teaching 
space, and improvements made to the gymnasium. During the summer of 2014, due to an increased need for teaching 
space, a leased portable was installed with Developer Fee funds.
 
 
During the summer o
f 2017, Prop 39 funding provided new LED lighting in all classrooms along with occupancy sensors. 
The parking lot also received new LED lighting.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pa
rental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Opportunities for parental 
involvement in the district and at the school site are abundant, and our parents have always 
given generously of their time, attention, and monetary resources. Their efforts mean far more than the material benefits 
they bring; they make our students and te
achers feel valued and important. Such feelings contribute directly to our 
educational excellence.
 
 
Every year, parents and other community volunteers contributed thousands of hours directly to Crocker Middle School in 
the classrooms, in the library, servi
ng on committees, assisting with special projects, and in many other ways. Parent 
volunteers shelve, check
-
out and check
-
in library books. They help with activities and chaperone dances and field trips. 
Parents as well as community members speak to classes
 
and share their occupational or scientific expertise. Through 
organizations such as the Parent Group and the School Site Council, parents learn about activities at the school and set 
goals to raise student achievement and continually improve the school.
 
 
At the district level, thousands of additional volunteer hours are given to fund
-
raising events, sponsored by the 
Hillsborough Schools Foundation, such as the general campaign, tennis luncheon, dinner dance, and e
-
Scrip program. The 
Hillsborough Schools F
oundation provides funds annually to the district in order to enhance the already excellent 

look for ways to be even better.
 
 
Paren
ts and community members have also continuously supported the schools through their votes: In June of 1988 and 
again in 1992, the community passed parcel tax measures in order to maintain school quality. In November of 2002, the 
community of Hillsborough p
assed Measure B, a $66.8 million dollar school bond measure for the purpose of modernizing, 
renovating, and adding facilities as needed at our four school sites. Measure B was a Proposition 39 bond requiring a 55% 
majority to pass. All members of the schoo
l community worked hard to inform the voters about the need for the measure. 
In response, the community show edits strong support for our schools by passing the Measure with a 66.45% majority 
vote.
 
 
Parents are kept well informed about the school through 
the school newsletters, calendars, web pages, parent group 
meetings, parent education events, as well as parent conferences. Any parent wishing to contribute time, expertise, or 
money to the schools has ample opportunity to do so and should start by contac
ting the school site parent group president 

 
http://www.hcsd.k12.ca.us which has links to all school websites, as well as the foundation.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety is our number one priority in the Hillsborough City School District school 
community. We focus on maintaining safe 
and caring school communities where all students and families feel welcome, valued, and respected.  When students feel 
safe at school they can focus on learning.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan, developed in con
junction with the San Mateo County Office of Education and City 
Services, includes disaster preparedness and emergency procedures, and provides the basic guidelines for responsibilities 
and procedures needed to address major emergency situations.  This pla
n is updated and reviewed with staff annually.
 
HCSD has a District Safety Committee that meets a minimum of 5 times a year for planning and trainings.  The committee 
is comprised of two teachers per site, and two parents from each site.  The committee is r
esponsible for keeping the 
Incident Command System organizational chart current, attend disaster preparedness trainings, and be the liaison 
between the District Safety Committee and Site Safety Committee.  At the site level, the Safety Committee is respons
ible 
for maintaining emergency backpacks for each classroom, inventorying the emergency shed, and reviewing Big Five 
Protocols with the staff.

Each year the district offers training to its new teachers before the start of school and continues with specific new teacher
 
support for two full years, 
including participation in the BTSA (Beginning Teachers Support and Assessment) program. The 
district provides three full days of professional development for teachers each year (August, October, and March) and 
supports the continual professional growth of
 
teachers in various ways. Teachers participate in off
-
site professional 
development opportunities on a regular basis, and expert coaches and consultants work with teachers, on
-
site as well.  
The district encourages veteran teachers to grow through its HIP
 
(Hillsborough Incentive Plan) Program, and through 
providing support for teachers who wish to become Nationally Board Certified. Individual teachers are encouraged to take 
classes specific to their subject area in order to ensure they meet the requirement
s for NCLB certification as highly 
qualified teachers. Compliance training for certificated and classified staff, such as CPR/First Aid, is held as needed. 
Specialists are also provided training relevant to their assignments, and training for all involved 
occurs any time new 
standards or materials are adopted.
 
 
By adding instructional minutes on other days, Thursday afternoons are available for both school site and district staff 
development or collaborative work groups. This is in addition to the weekly te
acher, grade
-
level, and/or departmental 
collaborative time. TOSAs (Teachers On Special Assignment) were instituted District
-
wide to provide training for classroom 
teachers in the area of Technology Integration (2015
-
2016) and Math/Science support (2016
-
201
7). Web Advisers, Data 
Advisers, and Curriculum Advisers /Lead Teachers, also support the furtherance of the school site and district
-
wide goals. 
The administration and staff maintain a mutual support system, with close communication and strong cooperative
 
planning. For the 2018
-
2019 school year, a Science Advisor role and a part
-
time Educational Services TOSA are being 
utilized to support curriculum implementation and student growth.
 
 
During the 2019
-
2020 school year, the HCSD is providing professional dev
elopment to teachers in the areas of 
Reading/Language Arts, Mathematics, and Science. Additional professional development opportunities will be provided 
as needs arise and change.
