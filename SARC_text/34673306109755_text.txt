By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
School Vision and Mission:
 
Folsom Hills Elementary School, via it's internal professional learning communities, guiding coalitions, and multi
-
tiered 
support system groupings, has created a vision for all students to 
succeed at their highest academic, social, and emotional 
potential.
 
 
Our school wide academic program is based on clearly defined standards and high expectations for all students 
academically, emotionally, and behaviorally. Staff collaborate using up to da
te curriculum, professional development, and 
interventions to support students at risk in order to close the achievement gap and create an environment for student 
success. Professional Learning Communities and their interconnected communication and collabo
rative strategies, have 
redefined our approach to ensuring this vision is implemented with fidelity.
 
 
Folsom Hills is a safe, healthy learning environment based on a belief that students learn to be accountable for their 
behavior to assure a successful sch
ool experience. Parents and the public are encouraged to be involved with the school 
program through our Parent Teacher Association, School Site Council, and classroom volunteer programs KILN [ceramics], 
FAME [artists and composers], class buddy groups [pe
er mentoring], PC Pals [private outside companies, such as Intel 
offering mentoring], etc...)
 
 
The district
-
adopted academic curriculum provides for both basic skills and enrichment in the regular classrooms. The staff 
and parents of Folsom Hills students 
have worked hard to create an academically and socially rich elementary school 
setting, in which our students strive for social and academic success in a culturally and socioeconomically diverse society.
 
 
School & Community Profile:
 
Folsom Hills is an elementary school in Folsom, California, serving Pre
-
K through 5th grade students and families. For the 
2019
-
2020 school year, Folsom Hills serves approximately 600 students. Students come from a variety of surrounding 
neighborhoods, pri
marily The Parkway, Briggs Ranch, and Willow Creek. Numerous students also join us from throughout 
the district as well, due to our Foreign Language Elementary School (FLES) program, aka know as the Spanish Magnet 
program.
 
 
Unique for 2019
-
2020, is the fac
t that Folsom Hills is split into 3 separate sites, due to modernization of the Folsom Hills 
campus. This set of circumstances provides a unique chance for Folsom Hills students and teachers to experience, view 
and interact with students and teachers from 
our sister schools 
-
 
Empire Oaks Elementary and Sandra J. Gallardo. Inter
-
weaved throughout this document will be references to this set unique situation, and it should be noted that while 
students are being housed at these three sites, each student is tau
ght by a Folsom Hills teacher, and the administrative 
support team remains the same, no matter what site they are temporarily housed at.

If  an  individual  were  to  look  into  any  of the 35 classrooms  at  Folsom  Hills and our sister campuses,  they 
 
would  find  
parent  volunteers,  along  with  teachers,  assisting students  with  both  academic  and  social  goals  and  benchmarks.  
One would also see specially  trained  parent  KILN  (ceramics)  docents, FAME (artists and composers) docents, scien
ce 
docents, and Intel volunteer matching grant volunteers working with the students. PC Pals are onsite several times each 
trimester, and community programs 
-
 
from the police and fire departments, to local businesses 
-
 
are a positive and 
engaged presence o
n campus.
 
 

-
goal is to prepare our students to become responsible citizens and productive, caring members of the 

and emoti
onally.  Opportunities for differentiated instruction are available for each student, including those identified for 
Gifted and Talented Education, Specialized Academic Instruction, or Intervention;  instructional intervention and 
enrichment programs are o
ffered to insure all students are supported in meeting grade level standards in reading and 
math.  Multi
-
tiered support systems English/language arts groupings, iReady, small group math instruction, intervention, 
and early/late friend times for grades K
-
2 
all assist with this goal.
 
 
The Folsom Hills' team believes that a positive school culture must be provided to all students, coupled with an 
academically challenging curriculum (and all in a caring and positive school environment).  Experienced teachers an
d 
support staff, coupled with professional learning communities groupings consisting of Grade Level Teams, Safety, Positive 
Behavior and Intervention Systems, Foreign Language 
-
 
Elementary School/Spanish Magnet, and Project Lead the Way, all 
contribute to 
this over
-
arching goal.  A strong, school
-
wide Positive Behavior Intervention Systems program utilizing the 

of students in creating a h
ealthy and safe learning environment, with FoxPoints, prize wheel spins, Super Fox Awards, and 
other school
-
wide incentives being used as reinforcements.
 
 
Our active Student Council provides awareness of the importance of community service for all children
 
at Folsom Hills.  
Folsom Hills is well known for its strong, supportive parent community.  In addition to classroom volunteers, parents also 
serve on our Site Council, which assists with important curriculum, budget, and facility decisions.  Our Parent Te
acher 
Organization plans numerous activities that serve as a positive bond between home and school, and provides financial 
support for our many programs.  Parent  involvement is the  focus  of  our  Parent Teacher Organization.  We  are  pleased  
to  say  
that  our  PTA  membership  is  one  of  the  highest  in  the Third  District  Council.  PTA  is  improving  the  quality  
of  instruction  by  providing  funds  for  field  trips,  equipment  for  student productions, technology, books, and other 
instruc
tional activities, as well as paying for our Project Lead the Way curriculum, and supporting our Spanish Magnet staff 
and students.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
2019 August
 
 
Folsom Cordova Unified held a Public 
Hearing on December 19, 2019, and determined that each school within the District 
has sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students,
 
including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned 
textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle 
developed by the State Department of Education, making the 
textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committ
ee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. 
The table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent 
Year)
 
 
Folsom Hills Elementary was originally constructed in 1991 and is comprised of 33 classrooms, a multipurpose 
room/cafeteria,  library, staff lounge, and three playgrounds (Kindergarten, primary and intermediate). Starting in May of 
2019, Folsom Hil
ls Elementary began a full
-
scale modernization, which includes a complete remodel of the administrative 
offices, multipurpose room and rooms 1
-
18, plus the student care building. Rooms 19
-
33 (currently housed in portables) 
have been replaced with modular b
uildings. All grounds will be redone, and the expected completion date is January of 
2020.
 
 
The principal works daily with the custodial staff to ensure that the cleaning of the school is completed so as to provide a 
clean and safe environment for everyone
. The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in 
the district. A summary of these standards is available at the district office for review.  District maintenance staff ensure
s 
that the repairs necessary to keep the school in
 
good repair and work orders are completed in a timely manner, though 
while undergoing modernization, this is a collaborative effort with the contractor and sub
-
controctors. A work order 
process is used to ensure efficient service and highest priority are 
given to emergency repairs. While reviewing this report, 
please note that even minor discrepancies are reported in the inspection process. The items noted in the table have been 
corrected or are in the process of remediation.   The district participates in
 
the State School Deferred Maintenance 
Program, which provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major 
repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically this includes roofing
, plumbing, heating, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
incl
udes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. 
Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilitie
s); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
If an individual was to look into any classroom at Folsom Hills, they would find parent volunteers, along with teachers, 
assisting students with both academic and social goals and benchmarks. One would also see specially trained parent KILN 
(ceramics) doce
nts, FAME (art) docents, science docents, and Intel VMG volunteers working with the students. Parent 
involvement is the focus of our Parent Teacher Association  (PTA) activities. We are pleased to say that our PTA 
membership is one of the highest in the Th
ird District Council. PTA is improving the quality of instruction by providing 
funds for field trips, equipment for student productions, technology, books, and other instructional activities, as well as 
paying for full time library services.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There were three (4) student accidents reported at our school in the 2018
-
19 school year. Restrooms and eating facilities 
are cleaned daily. Classrooms are cleaned every third day. Any safety hazard that is reported is reviewed immediately and 
resolved. Sa
fety plans are reviewed each fall and spring. Emergency plans have been developed in case a threatening 
situation should arise. A FIT report is submitted to the district office on a monthly basis. Please note that for 2019
-
2020, 
Folsom is undergoing modern
ization, and students are housed at multiple sites; each site has a vetted and approved safety 
plan unto itself, which Folsom Hills' teachers and students follow.
 
 
Folsom Hills is very concerned with safety. Safety is addressed in a variety of 
methods. Folsom Hills has a strong and 
positive relationship with the Folsom Police Department. Our Comprehensive Safe School Plan is updated each year and 
is posted in a visible place in our front office. Our well
-
equipped Crisis Response Box is updated e
ach fall and spring and is 
also housed in a visible place. Folsom Hills' Emergency Preparedness manual, which contains specific instructions to be 
followed in the event of a real or potential disaster, is reviewed each year. These manuals are posted in eac
h classroom 
to ensure they are accessible by teachers and support staff, and staff is trained to implement the safety procedures.

It is the goal of Folsom Hills Elementary 
to assist students in their social and personal development as well as their 
academic aspirations. We give special attention to students who experience achievement problems, have difficulty coping 
with personal and family problems, and who encounter troubl
e with decision making or handling peer pressure.
 
 
In addition:
 
Teachers, the administrative team, and our site psychologist all work to ensure that student needs are met, including, 
when appropriate, referrals to Early Intensive Behavioral Treatment (EIBT
) pre
-
school programs, occupational therapy, 
physical therapy, speech, behavior specialists, and special education programs.
