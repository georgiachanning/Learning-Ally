California Assessment of Student Performance andProgressThe California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress(CAASPP) System includes the Smarter Balanced SummativeAssessments (SBAC) for students in the general educationpopulation, and the California Alternate Assessments (CAAs) forstudents with the most significant cognitive disabilities.  Only eligiblestudents may participate in the administration of the CAAs.  CAAsitems are aligned with alternative achievement standards, which arelinked with the Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  CAASPPresults are a measure of how well students are masteringCalifornia's standards in English language arts/literacy (ELA) andmathematics, and are given to grades three through eight and gradeeleven. SBAC tests assess student performance in ELA/Literacy andmathematics utilizing computer-adaptive tests and performancetasks, and CAAs test items are aligned with alternative achievementstandards which are linked with the Common Core State Standards(CCSS).The CAASPP results shown in this report include overall resultscomparing the school, district and state scores as well as theschool's overall score in each applicable subgroup. Results areshown only for subgroups with ten students or more taking the exam.For those categories that are blank in the tables, no students metsubgroup criteria.
