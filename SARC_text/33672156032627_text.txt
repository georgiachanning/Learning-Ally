Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., 
California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/
literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California St
ate University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

As a member of the NEU, No Excuses University, we provide parents with an opportunity to learn about academic 
readiness and college readiness.  We have  parent education, which includes workshops on the importance of school 
attendance, grade level standard
s, and college readiness.  Opportunities to participate in school activities such as School 
Site Council and English Learner Advisory Committee meetings are provided monthly.  Parents are also invited to volunteer 
in any way they are able to.  Parent works
hops and outreach are designed to facilitate involvement and foster a connection 
to ensure  their child's academic success.  At the conclusion of the school year, parents are acknowledged and celebrated 
for their contribution to our school community.
 
 
Pare
nts are encouraged to attend Back to School Night, parent conferences, Open House, SSC meetings, ELAC meetings, 
and other school functions such as awards assemblies and PTA family events.  All parents are encouraged to take an active 
role in their child's 
education with ongoing communication between home and school.  We strongly believe that our 
students' academic success is forged through the partnership between home and  school.  Parents are highly encouraged 
to participate in the following parent groups:
 
 
1. School Site Council

2019 school year, all staff members at Highgrove participated in staff development training. Many staff 
members participated in activities sponsored by the school, district, or through special projects that were appropriate for 
their indivi
dual needs. The major topics covered during the workshops are listed below:
 
 
Our professional development is based on building capacity of our teachers so they can meet the needs of our student 
population.  Most training are based on curriculum or interven
tions that can enhance instruction and facilitate student 
achievement.  Recent topics are based on the building relationships and improving communication with students.  We do 
a book study every year that is integrated into team meetings and staff meetings

Our primary area of focus is preparing every Highgrove student for college.  We use data to determine our staff 
development needs.  We often have 
opportunities for teacher to teacher training and have support from Instructional 
Specialists who meet with grade level teams and present at staff meetings to build capacity with the common core state 
standards and to improve instruction.  Professional Lea
rning Communities,  instructional rounds and team coaching 
support the implementation of new strategies and teaching outcomes.
