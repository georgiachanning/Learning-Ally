School Description
 
Frederiksen Elementary was established in 1966 and is located on the west side of Dublin, CA. Our 
Title I school is home to 756 students from diverse backgrounds including our local military base, 
Camp Parks. Our site has 30 self contained classrooms rangi
ng from Kindergarten through fifth 
grade.  We are proud to have over 32 languages spoken at our school and to showcase the rich 
cultural diversity that is part of our school community. Our English Learner Advisory Committee, 
our School Site Council, and ou
r Parent Faculty Club make valued contributions to the progress at 
Frederiksen each year. Our state CAASPP tests scores from the Spring of 2019 showed that our 
students continue to score above the statewide average in both English Language Arts and Math.
 
 
Our mission is to build for the future together, by laying the foundation for life
-
long learning, pride 
in character, and a lasting commitment to the community.  If you were to walk into a classroom at 
our site, you would see and hear social contracts bein
g reinforced among students. Teachers are 
making connections to real
-
world applications and posing questions to deepen student thinking. 
Students are being asked to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate both academic content and learning 
processes. We believe 
strongly in developing the whole child to build the skills necessary to succeed 
both as a student and as a future citizen in the global economy.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
Our federal Title I funds are used to fund a portion of one full
-
time Intervention Sp
ecialist. We use 
a scheduled banded service time five days/week to support teachers in directly working with 
students who are not meeting grade
-
level standards in kindergarten through fifth grade. Both a 
pull
-
out program and a push
-
in program are utilized 
to work with students identified through an 
on
-
going data collection process. Our Response to Intervention Team meets regularly to coordinate 
our efforts in serving students and ensuring academic progress is being monitored. In addition to 
analyzing data, 
our continual communication and collaboration with classroom teachers is key to 
helping meet  the needs of our students and for evaluating programs and instructional practices 
related to our Title I funding source.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data to
ol located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and 
comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic 
system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at 
public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., 
the California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally 
provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include t
he hours of 
operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types 
of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law 
to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to 
prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
con
sistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school p
rincipal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We choose our te
xtbooks from lists that have already been approved by the state education officials. For more than six years, panels of schol
ars have 
decided what California students should learn and be able to do. Their decisions are known as the California Content Stand
ards, and they apply to all 
public schools in the state. The textbooks we use and the tests we give are based on these content standards, and we expect o
ur teachers to be firmly 
focused on them.
 
 
All students have their own set of textbooks to use in class
 
or at home.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Frederiksen's last modernization projects were completed in 2010. The 2008 modernization added five classrooms; a new roof; 
technology; and the 
redesign of our portable classrooms, courtyard, and playgrounds. In 2009, new windows, doors, landscaping, lighting, paint an
d redesigned parking areas 
were added. All 32 classrooms have heating and air
-
conditioning systems, carpet, win
dows, and paint. In 2010, our student and adult restrooms were 
remodeled, along with the front entrance to our school. These final changes ended the first phase of our master plan, which i
ncludes additional changes 
if funding becomes available in the futur
e. Two playgrounds and an extensive field provide students with the space and equipment to play and develop 
athletic skills. We are thankful for these projects, because they are helping us look "as great on the outside as we are on t
he inside." We have one
 
full
-
time and one part
-
time day custodian and an evening custodial team who clean all classrooms and all restrooms each day. District maintenance re
gularly 
maintains landscaping.
 
 
The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program,
 
which provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this in
cludes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, e
lectrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may p
articipate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental 
Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
At Frederiksen School, staff, students, and pa
rents collaborate for success. We have an active parent community and our parent involvement is strong. 
Teachers encourage parents to assist in their classrooms as well as attend field trips in order to work directly with student
s in support of their learn
ing.  
Volunteers have dedicated many hours in support of curricular activities to boost student success.  In the classrooms, you wi
ll see parents reading one
-
on
-
one with students, running centers, stuffing communication folders, and helping with math conce
pts or art enrichment.  Around the campus, you will 
see parents assisting with bulletin boards that provide information or showcase student progress, copying necessary curricula
r materials for classrooms, 
or assisting as a paid noon supervisor for recess s
upport.
 
 
We have many ways for parents to participate in the life of our school, and we depend on parents to keep our programs running
 
smoothly. Parents can 
join our School Site Council, which collaborates with the principal, assistant principal and staff 
members to help make financial decisions that support 
the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement.  Parents of English learners are vital to our English Language Advisory Committee and to our outreac
h efforts 
on behalf of new families. We hold an annual Title 
I Informational Event to meet with our Title I families and discuss ways to best serve their children. 
Room parents organize parent volunteers to help with special projects in the classroom, and our Parent Faculty Club hosts man
y social events to bring 
the
 
community together, as well as to help in raising funds to support student and school programs. Our PFC has focused on STEAM 
opportunities over 
the past several years and volunteers have been integral in everything from marching and leading cheers in city
 
parades to designing flyers for the various 
PFC events happening throughout the year.  We ask all parents to attend Back
-
to
-
School Night and parent
-
teacher conferences in the Fall and Open 
House in the Spring.  We always welcome new ideas and volunteers o
n our campus.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The
 
SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Maintaining a safe and orderly 
environment is a top priority at Frederiksen.  We annually update and revise our school safety plan, which is based on the 
Safety Emergency Management System. Our plan includes procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and inventories of emergency s
upplies.
 
We share 
and monitor the plan with all staff during one or more staff meetings in the Fall and throughout the year as needed. This pla
n has been updated onto 
our Google Docs platform for staff to access from anywhere at any time. We discussed and reviewed
 
components of our safety plan during staff meetings 
on 9/4/19 and 10/2/19.
 
 
Our students and staff receive training in fire, lockdown and shelter in place drills. We participate in a statewide earthqua
ke drill called  "The Great CA 
Shake Out" each year in
 
October.  We use debriefing sessions after every drill to gather input to improve our safety procedures. Monthly fire drill r
eports 
are shared with the local fire department and our district maintenance department.  Each classroom has emergency backpacks 
containing a variety of 
first aid materials and guardian and health information. Each student has an emergency kit, stored in our container, with sup
plies to be used in case of 
an emergency.  These are purchased for our Kindergarten students annually and h
ave a shelf life of 6 years. In addition, we have a stored water supply 
that could provide necessary hydration for our students for up to three days in the event of any emergency.
 
 
We conduct at least one school
-
wide assembly on safety issues each year, in
cluding but not limited to: stranger danger, crossing streets, bicycling safety, 
and anti
-
bullying. We also participate in DARE, a drug and alcohol prevention program, for fifth graders, and Red Ribbon Week Health A
wareness for the 
entire school. We commun
icate and reinforce safety and student character education through school and classroom behavior expectations, daily 
announcements, classroom lessons, and character trait awards assemblies. Parents learn about safety procedures in weekly bull
etins and mont
hly 

 
 

er to wear throughout their 
stay. We screen all volunteers throu
gh the Megan's Law database prior to their volunteer work on our campus. We have one part
-
time campus supervisor 
to assist with traffic and parking as well as gates and campus supervision. Assigned teachers and staff monitor the school gr
ounds for 15 minut
es before 
and after school, as well as at all recesses and at lunchtime. Teachers regularly review the rules for safe and responsible b
ehavior in school and on the 
playground.

During the past three school years, 2016
-
2019, there have been three non
-
student days dedicated for 
Professional Development and 21 Teacher 
Collaboration Days where teacher teams meet for one hour. Dedicated staff development days are scheduled on the school
-
year calendar in a 
collaborative effort between the district leadership team and our Dublin Teach
er Association. Content for two of the three days is determined by the 
District based on areas of focus, Common Core Standards, Professional Learning Communities, textbook adoption cycles, and the
 

The third staff development day 
is determined in collaboration between the staff and principal. We use a needs survey to gather teacher and staff input 
for suggestions. Each site plans their teacher training based on needs identified in their site plan, such as finding ways to
 
narrow our
 
student opportunity 
gaps and working with at
-
risk students.  In August of 2018, Frederiksen focused on Skill & Will Alignment/Special Education and Executive Functioning,
 
as well as our new English Language Arts Adoption, Benchmark Advanced.
 
 
Teachers and
 
administrators have also participated in training from the Association of California School Administrators, Capturing Kids He
arts, and Guided 
Language Acquisition Development (GLAD). Additional staff development opportunities take place when teachers are 
released through the use of 
substitutes for site grade level planning/implementation meetings and/or observing best practices in one another's classrooms
. After school workshops,  
grade level collaboration, and staff meetings also host professional develop
ment offerings for staff. Frederiksen has an instructional coach assigned to 
our site to support in
-
class instruction in all curricular areas.
 
 
Staff development includes, but is not limited to: Response to Intervention (RTI), Professional Learning Communi
ty (PLC), Common Formative 

iting, and science.
