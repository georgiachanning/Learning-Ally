Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the State Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most cur
rent available. Materials approved for use by the state 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent exami
nation, upon request, prior to 
adoption. The table displays information collected about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Manzanita Community Day. The school is in compliance with all laws, 

Preparedness 
Plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are 
conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year. Lockdown drills are held as needed. Students are supervised 
before and after school by certif
icated staff, and certificated staff supervise students during lunch. Certificated staff help 
with supervision during lunch and break periods. There is a designated area for student drop off and pick up.
 
 
In 1998, the Comprehensive Safety Plan was developed by the District in consultation with local law enforcement in order 
to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997. The plan provides students and staff a means to ensure a safe and orderly learning 
environment.
 
Components of the Comprehensive Safety Plan include child abuse reporting procedures, teacher 
notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress from 
school, sexual harassment policies, and dre
ss code guidelines. The plan was last updated and reviewed with school staff 
in January 2020. All revisions were communicated to both the classified and certificated staff. It was approved by the 
Chawanakee Unified School District Board of Trustees on Janu
ary 14, 2020. An updated copy of the plan is available to the 
public at the school and District offices.
