THE LOS ALTOS SCHOOL VISION
 
 
Los Altos strives to create a relationship between the home, school, and community that promotes 
cultural sensitivity, instills a strong 
foundational passion for reading, writing, and prepares all 
students to become life
-
long independent learners. Together, the staff at Los Altos, our parents, 
and our community stakeholders will empower students to prepare for an ever
-
changing, diverse, 
com
petitive, and complex world.
 
 
Principal's Message
 
Los Altos School is a transitional kindergarten through grade 3 school which educates 
approximately 330 students. The school is located in South Whittier, California. The school has one 
Transitional Kinderg
arten/Kindergarten class, one Dual Immersion Transitional Kindergarten class, 
two Dual Immersion Kindergarten classes, three first grade, three
-
second grade, three third grade 
classes, a Transitional Kindergarten through grade 2 Special Day Class (SDC) for
 
the Severely 
Handicapped (SH); and an onsite resource and Response to Intervention (RTI) program.  Common 
Core State Standards and 21st Century Learning Skills are the foundation of the academic program. 
The school has a clear focus on literacy and numera
cy. We believe the home, school, and 
community working together can build a solid instructional program where all children are 
academically challenged. It is our goal to nurture students to become career and college ready. 
Every Friday students wear their 
Bulldog shirts to promote school spirit. Every Tuesday, students, 
and staff wear their college spirit t
-
shirts to promote college and career awareness.
 
 
Los Altos believes in the development of each child's social and emotional needs within a nurturing 
and
 
safe learning environment. As such, the school has embraced the Positive Behavioral 
Interventions and Support (PBIS) framework for promoting and recognizing desired behaviors and 
expectations. A strong School Study Team (SST ) exists to provide timely and
 
appropriate safety 
guards and interventions for students with social, emotional, health, and or academic needs.  
English Language Development (ELD) is provided daily to our English learners. Students needing 
additional support through academic interventio
n participate in the school's RTI program.  Every 
student attends a 6
-
week course in African drumming through the Music Center of Los Angeles. 
The school offers a variety of after
-
school programs. Some of these programs are funded through 
school site funds
 
while others are run by outside agencies.  After school intervention and homework 
assistance for grades 1
-
3 are offered after school from November to April. Coding Class & Robotics 
for 2nd and 3rd graders are offered after school on Fridays from November 
to April. The school is 
also affiliated with an on
-
site after
-
school program, Think Together. Think Together offers daily 
academic and enrichment classes year
-
round.
 
 
Parents and the community are vital to the school's success.  As such, parents are highly
 
encouraged to attend Principal Cafecitos, PTA, SSC, parent education classes, school events, and to 
volunteer in their student's classroom. Several annual events are held to promote school and home 
partnerships. These events include  Family Fun Night, Fat
her Daughter Dance, and Mother Son Tea.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card 
(SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan
 
(LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For m
ore information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF w
eb 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessmen
ts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the 
University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

level advisory committees such as the District English Language Advisory 
Committee (DELAC) and the District Advisory Committee (DAC). There are also district and site
-
level parent involvement oppo
rtunities including but not 
limited to Wellness Committee, and the Fiscal Advisory Committee. At each campus, parents can become active in the Parent Tea
cher Associations (PTA), 
school site council (SSC),  English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), volunt

School Safety Plan
 
As required by state law, each school 
maintains a detailed safety plan and shares it on an annual basis. The safety plan was last reviewed on December 
9, 2019. All personnel is trained in emergency procedures and students take part in regularly scheduled emergency drills. Foo
d, water, medical,
 
and other 
emergency supplies are updated annually to ensure each campus is ready to respond in the event of an emergency or disaster. C
ampuses are carefully 
monitored before, during, and after school hours. Recess and lunch are supervised by school person
nel. Schools are secured with security fencing. All 
visitors are required to check in and out at the front office and wear a badge while on campus. Visitor procedures are strict
ly enforced. The district 
maintains proactive relationships with law enforcemen
t agencies to ensure the safety of all campuses. Furthermore, through Measure QS funding a 
general obligation bond passed by area voters to upgrade school facilities will support future modernization projects.

The primary focus areas of professional development are for teachers to be proficient in Common Core State Standards in Engli
sh Language Arts, Math 
and on the CAASPP/Smarter Balanced Assessment. For support, teachers 
received professional development from Educational Services, instructional 
coaches, principals, and workshops at the Los Angeles County Office of Education. Teachers participate in weekly grade level 
collaborative meetings and 
instructional learning walks 
where they observe their colleagues' instruction and share best practices. Technology has been a focus area and all teachers 
have been Google trained so they may use it as an instructional tool and facilitate students' presentations. In 2016, all tea
chers 
participated in GLAD 
(Guided Language Acquisition Design) to assist in effective teaching strategies for English Learners. They were participants 
in demonstration lessons and 
received feedback from GLAD trainers, instructional coaches, and principals.  In 
2018 all teachers participated in CGI (Cognitive Guided Instruction) to 
assist in teaching the rigor of CCSS math content standards and standards of mathematical practices(SMP). In 2019 all teacher
s participated in Capturing 
Kids Hearts professional develo
pment to support teaching and learning. All professional development occurred during the school day and/or after 
school."
