By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Pioneer Elementary School 
realizes the positive correlation between parent engagement and student success. For this 
reason, the school encourages parents and the community to participate in the education of its students. The school 
greatly benefits from its supportive parents who v
olunteer in the classroom, serve on committees, and participate in 
various school sponsored events. Parent volunteers also run the Safe Routes to School Program. Safe Routes to School is 
designed to decrease traffic and increase the health of children and 
the community. Safe Routes to School promotes 
walking and biking to school and uses education and incentives to show how much fun it can be! The program addresses 

forcement, and developing 
plans to create safer streets.
 
 
We believe a partnership with our families support student and our Pioneer Community. There are many opportunities to 
participate!  Parents are welcome to join the Parent Teacher Club, the English L
anguage Advisory Committee (ELAC), and 
School Site Council (SSC)
