Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

school year.  Our school counselor provides classroom guidance lessons on topics of charact
er, conflict resolution, and 
other timely topics.  To further enhance science instruction, students at Lin Howe participate in Maker Space lessons 
throughout the year.
 
 
Before school enrichment opportunities include Hiking Vikings and our Spanish Language 
Program.  Both programs are 
free to Lin Howe students and open to everyone in TK
-

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic
al education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Linwood E. Howe faculty, staff and community believes that students' physical and emotional safety is a prerequisite 
to learning and is a top priority. Our 
comprehensive school safety plan includes school
-
wide behavioral rules and 
expectations (including what to do if someone experiences or witnesses bullying), ingress/egress procedures, emergency 
procedures, and procedures for reporting child abuse, harassme
nt, sexual harassment, and bullying.
 
 
The school
-
wide rules and behavioral expectations are introduced each fall and reinforced throughout the year. 
Additionally, signs are posted throughout campus reminding students of the rules and expectations for the g
iven area. 
Classroom rules and expectations are posted in each classroom. Positive behavior reinforcement systems are in each 
classroom, the cafeteria, and the yard.
 
 
Emergency procedures are in place for the following types of emergencies: fire, earthquak
e, intruder/lock
-
down, shelter 
in place, and bomb threats. Emergency procedures include procedures for releasing students after an emergency. All 
emergency procedures are reviewed with staff members prior to the start of the school year and with students a
t the 
beginning of the year. Fire drills are held monthly, earthquake drills are held twice a year, and lock
-
down drills are held 
four times a year.

Each school year the school emergency plan is discussed and approved by the School Site Council.  The Scho
ol Site Council 
also looks at office referral and CA Healthy Kids Survey data to develop goals and an action plan for continual improvement 
of our campus environment as it relates to students' physical and emotional well being.
