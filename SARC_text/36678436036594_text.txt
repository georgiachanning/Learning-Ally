By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Victoria Elementary School is committed to fostering an envir
onment that enables all children to fulfill their potential 
academically, socially, and emotionally. Our school continues to be an outstanding example of how students representing 
18 different cultures and languages are able to successfully achieve and lea
rn together. The Parents, Teachers, 
Administrators and Support Staff at Victoria believe all children can learn. High expectations for learning are ensured by 
providing a safe, positive educational environment that focuses on developing students' 21st cent
ury skills. Students are 
provided a variety of opportunities to problem solve, think critically, be creative and imaginative and work together 
collaboratively. As such, the collective efforts of all stakeholders is essential to the continued growth of our 
students' 
academic achievement.
 
 
In a new endeavor to prepare students to be College and Career Ready, Redlands Unified School District and Victoria 
Elementary partnered with Garner Holt Productions to create an AniMakerSpace at Victoria. Through the use o
f robotics 
and electronics in the AniMakerSpace, students will participate in a modern science, technology, engineering and math 
program. The objective is to provide students with learning opportunities to practice 21st century skills such as problem 
solvi
ng, critical thinking, developing creativity and imagination and working as team members. This new innovative focus 
also inspired the creation of Victoria's new Library/Media Center. In addition to books, this center will house technology 
that extends the 
learning from the Garner Holt AniMakerSpace. One objective of this Media Program is to provide Victoria 
students opportunities to build entrepreneurial skills by marketing the products they make in our Garner Holt lab.
 
 
Heightened focus on student preparat
ion for College and Careen Readiness has led to Victoria Elementary embracing the 
Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) Program. Goals for our second year of program implementation include 
teaching students in grades 3 
-
5 to organize their materi
als, organize their homework and classwork and maximize their 
learning through conscious time management. Ongoing training and support for teachers will be critical to the programs' 
future success.
 
 
Areas of focus for student learning are based on the 2019
 
CAASPP data which indicates that ELA and Mathematics are 
below the commensurate levels of the District. In an effort to support student learning, reading and math intervention 
programs have been implemented and designed to help students identified below g
rade level. Writing across all grade 
levels and subjects continues to be an area of focus, especially for EL students. In this second year of implementation of 
the Write Brain writing program, the instructional focus continues to be on building and strengt
hening listening, speaking 
and writing skills.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Background:
 
Victoria was built 1949. Since then, there have been many
 
changes and additions made to the original school facility to 
accommodate more students and to modernize the campus. There are 29 classrooms, a library/media center, Garner Holt 
AniMaker Space and an enrichment room. Students and staff work hard to keep t
he campus clean and safe. Most recently, 
the appearance of our school was enhanced by exterior paint to all buildings on site, along with upgraded landscaping 
surrounding the school. In the ongoing effort to keep the facilities clean and safe, all the floo
ring has been replaced as 
well. All school facilities are in good repair, and maintaining a litter and graffiti free environment is a continued priorit
y. 
District and site administrators conduct regular inspections of the facility with the last one being c
ompleted in November 
2019. Additionally, custodial and maintenance personnel conduct quarterly reviews of the campus as part of their 
Professional Learning Community. The data generated from these reviews is used by site and district staff to maintain or 
i
mprove the cleanliness and functionality of the school.
 
 
Maintenance and Repairs:
 
The governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in RUSD. A summary of these standards is available at 
the school office, at the District Office, or at www.
redlands.k12.ca.us. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to 
develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school. When maintenance and repairs are needed, administration 
and site custodians arrange for repairs. If repairs are such tha
t they cannot be accomplished by the custodians, District 
maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary are made in a timely manner to keep the school in good working 
order. Also, an advanced work order process allows repairs to be prioritized and t
racked by site administration. The site 
Principal inspects the school regularly to ensure that the facility is clean, safe and in proper working condition. Finally, 

 
good repair and working order. 
Victoria was also found to be free of any undue hazards or chemical / cleaning agents which could cause student injury.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade elev
en. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabil
ities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Victoria Elementary School utilizes data from its California Safe School Assessment and suspension/expulsion reports to 
evaluate the current safety status. A Safe School Plan is adopted each school year and is reflective of the school's safety 
needs. The key components of Victoria's Safe School Plan include a description of school discipline policies and procedures, 
dress c
ode guidelines, suspension and expulsion policies, sexual harassment and bullying policies, child abuse reporting 
procedures and disaster response procedures.
 
 
To ensure student safety before school, campus monitors, teachers and administrators supervise t
he school grounds 
including the bus drop
-
off area, cafeteria and playground. All school entrances are monitored 24 hours a day via District 
surveillance cameras and signs are posted to indicate all visitors must report to the administration office and may 
not be 
on school grounds unless they have a visitor's pass. Finally, students are supervised throughout the day during all outside 
play time by either campus monitors, administrators and/or teachers. Victoria continues to enforce a closed campus 
policy. Du
ring school hours, there is a single entry access point where all visitors are required to show identification in 
order to obtain access to our campus. After school, teachers and administrators ensure the safety of students by 
supervising the bus loading a
rea and parking lot which is used by parents to pick students up from school. Teachers, 
campus monitors, and administrators supervise the areas until all students have left the campus for home or are 
accounted for in one of our after school programs.
 
 
Eart
hquake, fire and lock
-
down drills are conducted routinely in accordance with State and District requirements. Drills 
are not only used to educate adults and students regarding how to respond safely to emergency situations, but are also 
used to determine mo
re efficient and safer methodologies to respond to emergency situations.
 
 
Lastly, home to school communication has been improved through the use of the Aeries Parent Portal system, in addition 
to an increased presence in social media.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
Victoria Elementary School uses general and categorical funds to pay for support personnel, staff development, curriculum 
development, grade level collaboration, data team meetings and the purchase of materials to enhance the curriculum. 
Supplemental categ
orical funding sources come from the following: School
-
wide Title I, Title I, Part A, (parent involvement) 
Title III, Tier II LCAP funds, School Improvement and donations. 
 
 
Title I funds are used to provide remedial help for students in the areas of readi
ng, language and math. Intervention 
teacher salaries, materials and teacher salaries are also covered by these funds as they meet the needs of our most 
academically challenged students. School Site Program (SSP) funds are used to provide supplemental mater
ials and 
educational opportunities for students in K 
-
 
5th grades. Our LCAP funds are used for intervention teacher salaries, 
materials and teacher salaries for after
-
school programs, conference and workshop fees, as well as supplemental 
classroom material
s. 
 
 
All students receive instruction and support towards mastery of grade
-
level content standards utilizing a standards
-
based 
curriculum. In an effort to increase student mastery of essential state academic standards, students are provided targeted 
interv
entions to help them be successful in our district and state assessment programs. Teachers receive detailed analysis 
of their students' achievement on each subsection of the CAASPP by utilizing the Illuminate system. Students are taught 
test taking strateg
ies and practice those strategies on the RUSD Common Assessments, ICAs and IABs. Victoria teachers 
use the results of these assessments to drive their instruction and improve student achievement. 
 
 
Victoria teachers and other support staff work together to
 
meet the varied needs of a diverse cultural community. Our 
staff embraces a Growth Mindset and is committed to "success for all". We have a fully functioning Family Resource Center 
that provides services or referral for services such as dental care, medic
al care, weekend meals, a clothing bank, a food 
bank, bus passes, etc... Funding sources, over and above the base program, allow us to extend the base program through 
additional human resources, technology, instructional materials and other equipment. Pare
nt participation at our family 
nights, PTA functions, school committees and literacy classes are proof of their commitment to our school. The power of 
parents, teachers and students working together is immeasurable and only serves to strengthen our collect
ive 
commitment to providing a high quality education. Critical Needs: Victoria's critical needs as determined by surveys of 
staff, students and parents are as follows:

Staff development has always been a priority in the Redlands School District and specifically at Victoria. Professional 
development priorities are determined by student assessment data 
gathered from site, District, and State assessments. 
Thus, Professional development in Paths to Proficiency continues this school year in support of English Language Learners. 
EL training was also a continued focus this school
-
year. The whole staff has par
ticipated in EL trainings to implement new 
curriculum and to provide support with lesson planning for both integrated and designated classroom instruction. 
Teachers in grades 3 
-
 
5 have received training in the AVID program and are currently implementing s
ite objectives for the 
program. Plans have been made for representatives at each grade level to attend the AVID Summer Institute in 2020.  
Training in the California Common Core Standards (CCCS) continues at the district level with an emphasis on writing a
nd 
the Next Generation Science Standards. All teachers have participated in both district and school
-
wide training designed 
to support the new instructional standards. Professional development for the second half of the school year has been 
designed with a
n emphasis on STEAM instruction across all grade levels. AniMakers from Garner Holt Productions, along 
with support from District TOAs, will provide learning opportunities for our teachers to explore new instructional 
strategies they can implement to foste
r STEAM instruction into their educational programs.
 
 
At Victoria, there are variety of professional development  opportunities, one of which includes collaborative planning 
through our professional learning communities. Known as "data team meetings," teac
hers, administrators and the school's 
TOAs meet the week following each Common Assessment to discuss student progress toward proficiency.  At the data 
team meetings, teachers also develop plans for re
-
teaching standards to those students opportunities who 
demonstrate 
the need and forward plan for the next unit of study. Another form of professional development is site
-
based workshops 
in which site staff or District personnel facilitate learning opportunities for our teachers. These workshops focus on AVID 
i
mplementation, technology in the classroom, EL instructional strategies, and STEAM instruction. Teachers are also highly 
encouraged to attend outside professional development and have attended a variety of conferences which include Daily 
5, CUE, Charlotte 
Huck Reading Festival, AVID Pathways, AVID Summer Institute, and Kim Sutton math instructional 
strategies.
 
 
To better serve our diverse population, our entire staff holds either a CLAD, BCLAD, Language Development Specialist, or 
SB 1969 certificate. Also, 
all teachers meet the Highly Qualified Status as defined in the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act.
