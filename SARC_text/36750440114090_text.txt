By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/

For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
SCHOOL DESCRIPTION:
 
Since Mission Crest's opening in 2007, it ha
s been a commitment of this school to provide a quality education for the 
students in its community.  Currently we have aligned our educational practice with the district's goal, to prepare today's 
students for tomorrow's world.  We are committed to refini
ng our teaching practices to stay current with 21st Century 
teaching practices including the infusion of the 4Cs (Critical Thinking, Collaboration, Communication, and Creativity) into 
our daily practice. The teachers at Mission Crest collaboratively work t
ogether through the PLC process to implement the 
federally regulated California State Standards (CSS) as well as fulfilling the school mission of inspiring every student  to 
care, think, achieve, and learn. At its core, Mission Crest is the school in servi
ce of others.  Service learning is integrated 
into our curriculum and is a component in nearly all events at Mission Crest.  The staff at Mission Crest works diligently to
 
create a climate that instills within it's students that they are capable of growing
 
and being successful.
 
 
Our mission statement is at the heart of what we do as an educational team.  Due to a population growth that was 
occurring in Hesperia,  Mission Crest Elementary opened in August of 2007 for students in grades K 
-
 
5.  During the 
200
7/2008 school year, the school was split onto two campuses until our move to one site in March 2008.  Mission Crest 
opened with 745 students and 33 classrooms which included two special education classrooms. One unique thing about 
our campus is that it is 
the first all indoor campus in Hesperia. Our 6th graders joined our campus in March of 2009. We 
have continued to experience growth adding 5 portables in 2012/2013.  As the district has worked to lower class size in 
primary grades to a student to teacher r
atio of 23:1 additional classrooms were needed. In 2016/2017, Mission Crest 
opened with 6 new permanent portable classrooms.  This year, Mission Crest was allotted 2 more portables totaling 11.  
This last year, the district added two portables that created
 
much needed room for additional TK 
-
 
6 classrooms, district 
and county support services, as well as programs such as ASAP, Parent Center, and Music room.  Currently, Mission Crest 
has 41 highly qualified Certificated teaching staff members, 4 certificated
 
support staff, and 30 non
-
certificated support 
staff.  Mission Crest has the unique distinction of being the largest elementary school in the Hesperia Unified School 
District.

staff.  In addition, the teaching staff is continuously learning 

coach, district trainers, and Professional Learning Community (PLC) cohor

District (HUSD), each school site identifies and coordinates its own staff development activities based upon individual 
student needs, school site plans, and the districts designated focus areas.
 
 
Through the le
adership team, Mission Crest has agreed upon the focus for staff development to be in the areas: Social 
and Emotional Learning, Number Talks, Guided Reading, Write From the Beginning, Project Based Learning, DAILY 5/CAFÉ, 
Differentiation and Professional L
earning Communities.  These programs, along with other trainings, were selected based 

be college and career ready.   To best meet the indiv
idual needs of each grade level, PLC teams were able to attend 
supplemental training involving curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies in the content areas of 
reading/language arts and math that were provided via district staff development as we
ll as outside conferences and 
trainings.
 
 
HUSD supplements site

tal 
professional development is offered throughout the school year on early student release days, during summer vacation, 
and on weekends. Staff development topics and focus areas are identified and selected based upon input from the 
district's Professiona
l Development Committee, Principals' Roundtable, and teacher survey results. The Professional 
Development Committee meets four times a year to review student test results from state and district assessments and 
to review teacher survey needs. The Principal
s' Roundtable provides opportunities for school principals to discuss and 
share training needs based upon data analysis and classroom observations from each school site.
 
 
New teachers receive intensive support and training through the district's Induction 
Program and New Teachers Academy. 
For beginning and out

state teachers, the district utilized the state Induction Program (formerly known as Beginning 
Teacher Support and Assessment), a statewide and state
-
mandated research
-
based program providing suppo
rt and skill 
building through formative assessment and individualized support based on assessment. The New Teachers Academy 
sponsors three new teacher orientations each year to support year
