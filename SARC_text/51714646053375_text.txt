Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and communit
y members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and 
other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation
, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Central Gaither School is a ten acre site located twelve miles south of Yuba City and is part of the Yuba City Unified School
 
District.  It serves students from town as well as those from the rural community. The school originally o
pened in 1922 
and was rebuilt in 1955 after a flood destroyed much of the original buildings.  During the 2019
-
2020 school year, 
approximately 108 students will be served by Central Gaither School in grades kindergarten through five, which operates 
on a tr
aditional schedule.  All Central Gaither students benefit from diversity, cultural awareness, and great sense of 
community pride.
 
 
The mission of Central Gaither School is to provide a strong instructional program for all students to ensure 
academic 
excellence. We strive to provide those educational experiences which will give students the skills necessary to function 
successfully and independently as adults. We believe that all students can learn and the school strives to provide every 
oppor
tunity for maximum student achievement. The school also provides students with a supportive, caring, and safe 
environment that develops self
-
esteem, self
-
motivation, and a sense of responsibility. The staff believes that education is 
a collaborative effort
 
among home, school, and community, and with each segment's support, students will become 
successful, responsible citizens. The school goals that we have set to help us to reach our mission are currently focused 
on increasing academic achievement for all s
tudents in English Language Arts, Mathematics, literacy, and technology. 
Students will attend school in a clean and modernized facility.  Central Gaither provides a school garden to improve school 
climate and discipline, along with providing improvements t
o the landscape.  Students will participate in activities 
promoting physical and cognitive development and be recognized for their efforts and accomplishments in academics, 
attendance, character, physical education, and student leadership.  Central Gaither
 
provides continuous methods of 
communication to connect with and involve parents, staff, and the community  with a clear focus on improving student 
achievement.  We monitor progress toward meeting these goals during staff/professional learning community (
PLC) 
meeting days throughout the year where we analyze student data. We also discuss and review progress toward goals with 
our School Site Council, Parent Club, and our English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) regularly.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Central Gaither School was reconstructed in 1955 and has since undergone complete modernization. There are 16 
classrooms, 6 of which are relocatable buildings, and one multi
-
use room with a kitchen and stage area. The office is a 
building with four separate offices. Additionally, there is a staff room, supply room, and barn for storage. During the 
summer of 2018 t
he campus was painted, a security gate was installed, roofing was completed, and the floors were 
stripped and waxed. Planned improvements in 2019 included the PE track being sprayed for weeds and the surface 
scraped.
 
 
Central Gaither utilizes one full time
 
head custodian and one part time custodian that clean all school buildings/rooms 
daily. Custodial staff is on campus from 6:30 am to 7:00 pm daily and when needed for night time events. Yard duty 
supervisors, teachers, the administrator, and after school 
program staff provide supervision for students before, during, 
and after school to ensure safety. A Health Aide is available daily from 9:30 to 1:00. A nurse is on campus one half day per 
week.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The Central Gaither School community, staff, and parents understand that cooperation, teamwork, and communication 
are essential elements in meeting the educational needs of students. Community
 
members and parents are involved in 
many ways. Teachers welcome parents into their classrooms to serve as volunteers. The Parent Teacher Association (PTA) 
assists with planning and coordinating several fundraisers throughout the year, including but not li
