School Description
 
Otay School is one of 49 elementary schools in the Chula Vista Elementary School District, including 
charters. Otay Elementary was built in 1975 as ''loft'' design with all classes under one roof. Our 
school focuses on Social and Emotional Learning as the 
foundation for academic instruction.  The 
instructional focus is on building literacy across content areas, fostering a love of reading, and 
supporting our English Learners with high impact language strategies. Otay teachers collaborate 
weekly while studen
ts  attend specialty classes.  Every week, all students receive 2 hours of Art, 
Music and PE/Dance instruction.  To further support students' emotional needs we have a 
counselor who meets with students and supports teachers in their classrooms.
 
 
School

opportunities for all students and their families to take responsibility for learning and an active role 
in their education.  We are devoted to the success of all.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are

Research shows a high correlation between parent involvement and effective schools.  We welcome and 
encourage parents and grandparents to visit, 
volunteer and become active in our school.
 
 
Parents and members of the community continue to be welcomed as volunteers in our classrooms and to help with special events.
  
A Parent Volunteer 
Center is open Monday
 
through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  The Center provides a unique way for parents to help meet the needs of our studen
ts 
and school.  Otay parents serve as members of the School Site Council, ELAC, DAC/DELAC, PTO, as members of IEP teams, and in 
ou
r Positive Behavior 
Committee.  Parents and community members worked collaboratively with Otay staff to create a Vision and Mission Statement.  T
hey are an integral 
part in planning school activities.

School Safety Plan
 
Student safety and well being is promoted by activities including emergency and earthquake preparedness drills, bus evacuatio
n drills, playground 
supervision, Social and Emotional Learning, drug and alcohol abuse prevention education programs, child abuse 
awareness, and bullying prevention. The 
School Site Council approved the School Safety Plan, with modifications, on December 10, 2019.
 
 
Students are supervised before school and during lunch recess by yard supervisors.  The traffic patterns are monitored b
y the administration, parent 
volunteers, and assisted by the Chula Vista Police Department. During the school day, the school perimeter is secured so that
 
all visitors must enter and 
egress through the main office. Gates open at 7:15 am, relocked by 8:00 a
m and unlocked for dismissal at 2:20 pm. Otay uses the Raptor visitor 
management system to check
-
in all visitors to our campus, and visitors must wear a badge that identifies them for the duration of their visit.
