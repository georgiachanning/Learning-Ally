By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Tustin Unified School District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist 
in 
this effort, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School 
Constru
ction (OPSC). The results of this survey are available at the school office, the District office, or on the Internet at 
https://tinyurl.com/TUSD

Inspection
-
Tool. The District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to 
keep the school 
in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to 
ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Ladera Elementary School opened in 2001, as a newer facility, we have ac
cess to state of the art technology resources.  
Every regular education classroom contains a SMART Board that is connected to the teachers' desktop and school
-
wide 
server; a voice amplification system; and, a projector . Ladera's STEAM Lab is equipped with
 
40 iPads, a 70" Flat Screen 
Monitor/TV, 3D Printer, and printer.  Additionally, the main hallways and library are equipped with computers.  Students 
and teachers have access to wireless Internet and teachers correspond with parents via email on a regular 
basis.  In 
addition, technology is used as a tool for instruction and students are taught a variety of skills including keyboarding, wor
d 
processing, graphing and presentation skills.  Students and staff use a networked catalog system to search for specifi
c 
titles in our school library and have access to electronic books (eBooks).

Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud
y.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Date Last Reviewed by School Site Council (SSC): 10/22/19
 
Date Updated and Approved by SSC: 10/22/19
 
Date Discussed by Staff:  08/098/19
 
 
Our School Safety Plan includes the following elements: Child abuse reporting procedures, disaster procedures, routine 
and emergency (SEMS); suspension, expulsion, or mandatory
 
expulsion recommendations; procedures to notify teachers 
of dangerous pupils; discrimination/harassment policy; provisions of any school
-
wide dress code; procedures for safe 
ingress and egress; safe and orderly environment; rules and procedures on school 
discipline and dress code; hate crime 
reporting; school safety goals and objectives. We run monthly drills and work closely with our Student Services department 
to ensure that we have updated procedures and practices in place to ensure school
-
wide safety.
 
 
The school is a closed campus and all visitors and volunteers must sign in at the front office and wear a "visitor" badge 
while on campus as a form of identification.
 
 
Our campus is an orderly learning environment and staff members have high expectations for student behavior.  School 
rules/expectations are reviewed with students and parents at the beginning of each school year and parents receive a 
student handbook each 
September so the school rules/expectations can be reinforced at home.  Behavior expectations 
are reinforced throughout the school year, through school
-
wide assemblies and classroom conversations.
 
 
Emergency radios with connections district
-
wide as well as 
bands to surrounding districts and emergency support from 
local sheriff and fire departments were added to school safety equipment in the coming year. Emergency backpacks and 
supplies will be replenished in the coming year as well. Monthly emergency drills
 
are held to practice various situations 
the school may face including fire, earthquake and other emergency drills.  A comprehensive school plan with teams of 
staff members trained for specific duties is in place and a mock disaster drill is implemented on
 
an annual basis for practice 
and continued training.

Tustin Unified School District provides dedicated time for professional development for all 
staff.  Schools often provide 
additional professional development time based on specific school
-
site scheduling and budgetary decisions.  The District 
provides intensive workshops in August during the week before school starts to provide teachers with new 
knowledge 
and enhanced skills for the upcoming year.  Staff development opportunities are also offered after school and by release 
time throughout the school year.  Additionally, professional development is provided one non
-
student day in the fall and 
one 
afternoon per month after school.  New teachers are provided an extensive new teacher training program throughout 
the year to support their implementation of effective instruction.
 
 
In regards to Ladera's educational programs and instruction, our dedicated
 
teachers engage in collaborative planning 
every Friday for 60 minutes during their PE time, one 1/2 day Wednesday per month designated for PLC time, as well as 
2
-
3 Wednesdays per month from 2:00
-
3:15.  The principal provides staff professional development
 
meetings that focus 
on the process of Multiple Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS), Cognitively Guided Instruction, differentiating instruction, 
Readers and Writers Workshop, data interpretation and analysis and best first instruction.  For the 2017
-
18, 2018
-
19 and 
currently the 2019
-
20 school years, our site continues to focus on a Balanced Literacy approach to teaching reading and 
writing, as well as implementation and refinement of CGI and math workshop, and our professional development revolves 
around the
se focuses.  Teachers participate in a variety of District in
-
services as well as professional development 
workshops and conferences to enhance their knowledge and instructional skill.  The Peer Assistance Review (PAR) and 
Induction programs, District work
shops, and professional conferences are opportunities for professional development.  
The District continues to train teachers in strategies to deliver a differentiated curriculum with depth and complexity.  
Teachers utilize student assessment results to ta
rget instruction to better meet the individual needs of students.  All 
teachers at Ladera, including classroom and non
-
classroom teachers, new teachers, and veteran teachers needing 
assistance all participated in the above outlined opportunities.  Addition
ally, para professionals and other classified staff 
members are offered opportunities for professional growth through the district office.
