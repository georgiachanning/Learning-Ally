School Description
 
Martin R. Heninger Elementary School (Heninger Elementary) is located on the corner of West 
Walnut Street and South Birch Street.
 
 
The staff, students, and 
parents at Heninger Elementary are committed to the following mission:
 
The students at Heninger Elementary receive instruction based on the California Common Core 
Standards. Their progress is measured using classwork, district benchmarks, and state assessm
ents 
with an understanding that a majority of our students also need English language development in 
order to fully access the curriculum. Results are consistently communicated to the students and 
parents. Teachers meet in grade level teams with our Instru
ctional Leadership Team to collaborate 
on decisions of future instruction.  We are committed to meeting our students needs beyond the 
typical school day, we provide academic support before and after school to targeted students to 
ensure progress. As a scho
ol, we are also committed to the arts. We believe the arts and enrichment 
complete the process of educating the whole child.
 
 
There is a culture of collaboration, communication, accountability and parent involvement in place 
to ensure that staff, students 
and parents are aware of the students' progress.  Teach, learn, show, 
communicate, support, and build.

About 
the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Lo
cal Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities t
o address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

maintained and kept 
safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) employs an electronic work order sys
tem enabling school staff 
to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Mo
st of the school's repairs and maintenance projects are 

ither by the school custodian 
or district maintenance staff, based upon the
 
nature of the situation. Day and evening custodians work closely as a team and with the principal for routine 
maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events preparations. The principal and day custodian communicate daily to di
scuss campus cleanin
g 
needs and safety concerns. Every morning before school begins, the custodian, principal, and assistant principal inspect faci
lities for safety hazards, 
graffiti, and other conditions that require removal prior to students and staff entering school ground


rs on proper cleaning 
procedures, use of chemicals, and use of equipment. The 
day custodians are responsible for following an established set of cleaning standards and 
prioritization procedures for general campus maintenance. The day custodian checks restrooms twice a day as a proactive measu
re in keeping facilities 
well stocked, sa
fe, and sanitary. The evening custodians are responsible for thorough cleaning of classrooms, office areas, and restrooms. 
Groundskeepers are dispatched by the district office to perform general maintenance of landscaping, gardening, sports fields,
 
and irr
igation systems.

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced 
Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
-
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the 
number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
-
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether t
hey received a score or not; however, the number of students tested is 
not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated
 
using only students who received scores.
