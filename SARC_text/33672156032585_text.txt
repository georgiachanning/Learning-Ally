Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Fremont is an AVID Elementary and a No Excuses University School. We are committed to creating opportunities for our 
students to compete in the world through a relentless focus on college, career, and world readiness. We have except
ional 
systems of collaboration, data analysis, and interventions that allow teachers and support staff to target instruction for 
optimal acquisition of State Standards.
 
 
At Fremont Elementary School, we believe that all students can and will learn. We work
 
collaboratively with parents and 
each other to accomplish our goals. We treat all students with dignity and respect while maintaining a safe and orderly 
environment in which students are our priority. We teach the California Common Core State Standards an
d we monitor 
students' progress towards meeting the standards through the use of multiple measures.Specific areas of need are 
identified by regularly analyzing the results of data and adjusting our instruction to ensure that students have the skills 
that a
re essential for them to meet and exceed the standards. We communicate these findings with parents and provide 
students with the appropriate, targeted interventions. Further, in order to achieve the highest standards possible, we 
prepare students to evalua
te what they are learning while questioning, justifying, and defending their responses. The 
ultimate goal is that they become critical thinkers, lifelong learners, and productive citizens who are able to make claims 
and use evidence to justify the claims.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety 
Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Site Council or the Site Safety Committee is responsible for the development and updating of the school's 
Comprehensive Safety Plan. A Site Comprehensive Safety Plan Checklist is provided by the Pupil Services Depart
ment to 
give guidance on what should be included in the School's Safety Plan. The Safety Plan is discussed with staff, evaluated, 
amended/reviewed/updated by January 31 of each year. The school's safety committee makes monthly safety inspections. 
A school 
Disaster Preparedness Plan that deals with a wide variety of emergency situations is incorporated into the School 
Safety Plan.  Earthquakes, fire, lockdown, and active shooter/intruder drills are conducted as required. The key elements 
of the Comprehensive
 
School Safety Plan include an assessment of current status of school crime; provisions of any 
schoolwide dress code including the definition of "gang related apparel"; safe movement of pupils, parents and school 
employees to and from school; strategies in
 
maintaining a safe and orderly school environment; visitors on campus; child 
abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to suspensions, expulsion or 
mandatory expulsion and other school designated serious acts
 
which would lead to suspension or expulsion, notification 
to teachers, anti
-
bullying policy, discrimination/harassment, and school discipline rules and procedures pursuant to EC 
35291 and EC 35291.5. The school also has an assigned School Resource Officer
 
(SRO).
