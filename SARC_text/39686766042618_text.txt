Dear Harrison Bear Families,
 
I 

you to know that I continue to look forward to getting to know every child and share in the excitement of their 
learning experiences each d

the best learning environment and growth opportunities to ensure that all students have the opportunity to fulfill 
their potential.
 
 
It is very important that your chi
ld attends school every day on time.  Also, it is critical that your child is ready to 
learn and give their best effort every single day, because every day counts!  It truly takes a strong family and school 
partnership to ensure our students are successful
.  So we will continue to grow together, work together, and hold 
each other accountable.
 
 
We will continue to work together to improve and grow in the areas of student achievement and attendance to 
achieve our mission and vision.
 
 

ning is our core purpose."
 
 

-
rounded education including core subjects, technology, fine 
arts, athletic competitions, academic competitions and other opportunities to excel.  Students exit the school 
p
erforming at grade level or above and are prepared for academic and personal success at the next level.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law 
to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to 
prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
con
sistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school p
rincipal or the 
district office.

Quality, Curr
ency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes fo
r all students. The law also 
asks districts to re
veal whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far more meaningful when al
ong with 

 
names of the textbooks used 
in our core classes and their dates of publication.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Harrison School opened in 1950 and was remodeled/modernized in 1999. The school has approximately 697 students and 29 classro
om 
teachers. There 
are 14 permanent classrooms, 16 portable classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library, and an administration building.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are comp
leted in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that all classrooms, restrooms, and fac
ilities are well
-
maintained and in good 
repair. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Stockton Unified takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functi
onal. To assist in this effort, we utilize the facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California OPSC. The full report is available upon request.

State Priority:
 
Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smar
ter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible
 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 
Harrison School places a strong emphasis on providing a safe environment for all students, staff members, and the community. 

team ensures the sch
ool facilities are in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. Table tops, door handles, sinks, a
nd toilets 
are cleaned daily to maintain a healthy environment. During each vacation break, a deep cleaning process occurs. A site 
inspection checklist is completed 
quarterly by the head custodian and submitted to Risk Management, to ensure the site is safe and free from hazards.
 
 
A Comprehensive School Safety Plan, which is reviewed annually by the School Site Council, helps to provi
de a secure, peaceful and clean environment 

ral disasters. Fire Drills 
are conducted with all staff and students on a monthly basis
, with other emergency drills quarterly. In the event of a school emergency, the principal 
activates the Emergency Response Team, including notification of the appropriate site and district personnel to resolve the e
mergency and safely secure 
or evacuate t
he students, based upon the site and district Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools (REMS) guidelines. Parents are c
ontacted 
in a timely manner through the School Messenger message system to inform them of any important safety announcement.
 
 
Every
 
effort is made to ensure students are monitored while on campus throughout the school day. All visitors must sign in at the o
ffice and receive 
proper authorization to be on campus, and must display their passes at all times. Harrison School is committed i
n assuring that our playgrounds are safe 
for all students. We have a full time assistant principal, a full time campus safety assistant, and four part
-
time playground supervisors to provide 
supervision before school, at recesses, and after school. Teachers
 
also provide additional supervision during recesses and after school dismissal.
