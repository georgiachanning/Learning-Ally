About 
the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Lo
cal Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities t
o address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional informat
ion about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Landers Elementary works closely with the Maintenance & Operations Department (M&O) for larger projects, routine facilities m
aintenance projects, 
and school inspections. The most recent 
facilities inspection at Landers Elementary took place on June 25, 2019. Schools are required by state law to 
report the condition of their facilities; the School Inspection table illustrated below in this report identifies the state
-
required inspection ar

for student use at all times.
 
 
Facilities Maintenance
 

maintenance department work together to ensure classrooms and campus grounds are well
-
maintained and kept 
safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) employs an electronic work order sys
tem enabling school staff
 
to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Teachers and staff submit requests for uns
cheduled maintenance 
and special projects to the custodian or administrative assistant who submits a work order to M&O for resolut


ors, depending upon the scope 
of the project. Emergency situations are immediately called
 

based upon the nature of the situation.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the
