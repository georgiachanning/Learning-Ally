Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for e

In 2019
-
19, the district offered early release/late start Staff Development meetings on Wednesdays, as well as 6 days of 
Professional Development.
 
 
Professional development at Roosevelt Learning Community is 
focused on providing learning facilitators, coaches, and 
administrators with the necessary training to ensure quality classroom environments, curricula, instruction, and 
assessment at all content levels. Specific topics are identified through a review of s
tudent academic achievement data, 
observation records, and self
-
identification of needs. Professional development also addresses issues specific to the 
performance
-
based system (PBS). Professional development opportunities include district
-
wide in
-
services
 
(6 full days); 
designated site
-
specific in
-
services (34 early release days1.5 hours each); observations and training by site or district 
coaches; grade
-
level or department meetings; and more. The Beginning Teachers Support and Assessment (BTSA) and 
Peer A
ssistance and Review (PAR) programs also provide assistance to beginning and veteran teachers, as necessary.
 
 
Additionally, extra professional development opportunities were offered by the District through a TSL grant. These 
opportunities, offered on non
-
l
earner attendance days, included 1
-
2 day institutes,  4
-
5 day Academies with certification 
and 4
-
5 day Micro
-
credential sessions. Roosevelt staff took advantage of Content LIteracy, Designated ELD, Integrated 
ELD, Word Work, Guided Reading, Empower, and Ma
th Big 5.  Learning Facilitators chose the opportunities that best 
served their needs for improvement and growth in order to meet the needs of their learners.  In addition to the self
-
chosen TSL opportunities, Roosevelt participated in a site
-
based academy
 
of Balanced Literacy and English Language 
Development. This academy was designed with one extended Wednesday training until 5:00 PM monthly,  four Saturdays 
of intensive training and sixteen days of intensive coaching with the consultant. The TSL funding 
also allowed Roosevelt 
to participate in the Welty Internal coherence training in order to create a site leadership team to drive academic initiativ
es 
and positive culture.
