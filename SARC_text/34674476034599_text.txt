By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Profile:
 

opportunities. We w
ant to enable them to know and use their strengths. We want our students to build from those 
strengths and learn to face academic and social challenges with a strong sense of efficacy. The 540 students attending 
Greer are 31% Hispanic/Latino, 30% African A
merican, 22% White, 9% Asian/Asian American, and 8% other ethnicities. 
40% of our students are English language learners, with Spanish as a primary language, and 98% of our students are 
socioeconomically disadvantaged. As a staff we are committed to ongoin
g professional development for teachers and 
paraprofessionals. We believe we can make a difference in students' lives. We know that ongoing teacher growth and 
reflection will result in greater academic results for our students.
 
 
Because literacy, mathemati
cs, and social skills form the foundation for future success in both academic and employment 
pursuits, we put tremendous emphasis on instruction in all three areas.
 
 
LITERACY:
 
Greer is focused on a school
-
wide implementation of comprehensive balanced liter
acy instruction driven by Common Core 
standards through the use of a Gradual Release model of instruction. 
 
 
Greer's Comprehensive Balanced Literacy instruction includes:
 

 
Personalized, leveled reading and writing instruction for all students. Groups are 
flexible and assessment is 
ongoing to make sure students are working at their instructional level throughout the school year.
 

 
All students participate in high level, meaningful discussions with grade level literature.
 

 
All students are taught comprehension 
strategies that enable them to read challenging text.
 

 
All students are encouraged to read a wide
-
range of genres and text types, as well as books of their choice.
 

 
All students are explicitly taught phonics appropriate to their instructional level.
 

 
All stud
ents are taught about the writing process through student generated writing topics, response to 
literature, peer and teacher editing, and completed pieces which are shared with others.
 
MATH
:
 
Our mathematics program is focused on the development of mathemat
ical power and is based on Common Core 
standards. Our curriculum includes problem solving investigations, mathematical concepts formation through concrete 
and abstract methods, basic understanding of math facts, and the ability to relate classroom learning
 
with real life 
applications. Students articulate their mathematical thinking orally and in writing, both individually and collaboratively.
 
 
SOCIAL SKILLS:
 
Greer is a Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS) school. One of the foremost 
advances in our school
-
wide 
discipline is the emphasis on school
-
wide systems of support that include proactive strategies for defining, teaching, and 
supporting appropriate student behaviors to create positive school environments. Instead of using a piece
meal approach 
of individual behavioral management plans, a continuum of positive behavior support for all students within a school is 
implemented in areas including the classroom and non
-
classroom settings (such as hallways, buses, and restrooms). PBIS 
is 
a proactive approach to establishing the behavioral supports and social culture and needed for all students in a school 
to achieve social, emotional and academic success. Attention is focused on creating and sustaining primary (school
-
wide), 
secondary (cla
ssroom), and tertiary (individual) systems of support that improve lifestyle results (personal, health, social, 
family, work, recreation) for all youth by making targeted misbehavior less effective, efficient, and relevant, and desired 
behavior more functi
onal. Additionally, we provide character education and utilize Second Step curriculum to help 
students deal with feelings, problem
-
solving, and conflict resolution. We also have full
-
time counselors who help work 
with students individually and in small gro
ups, to help provide emotional support and promote social skills instruction. 
Our entire site practices Mindfulness and our students receive daily instruction and practice around Mindfulness and 
cultivating a Growth Mindset.

Quality, Currency, Availability of 
Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 2019
 
 
San Juan Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018 and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and go
od quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructiona
l materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most c
urrent available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent exa
mination at the district office prior 
to adoption. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the quality, currency, and availability of 
the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. If you woul
d like more information 
on the textbooks and instructional materials please visit our website: http://www.sanjuan.edu/Page/23485 In July 2009, 
EC Section 60200.7. The State Board of Education has adopted frameworks for ELA/ELD, Math, Science and Social 
Sci
ences, and has identified an approved list of instructional materials available for adoption. For more information

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Greer Elementary School, originally constructed in 1953, was modernized during the 1997
-
1998 school year, and is 
currently in the final phases of a complete rebuild, which should finish up over winter break of 2019.  Curre
ntly, there is 
sufficient space to house the student population.  Site custodial staff clean the buildings, along with district support for 
major/minor repairs.  The district provides gardening and landscape services on a regular schedule.  Regular 
fire/em
ergency drills are held, and badges are required for all visitors and personnel.  Driveway resurfacing, asphalt 
restoration between classroom wings, and irrigation system retrofit was upgraded in 2010, funded through Measure J.  
Additionally, the campus re
ceived new landscaping and irrigation; a 2 classroom portable was replaced and a shade 
structure was built on the front of the school.  The student restrooms were renovated during the summer of 2011.  In 
addition, a site
-
wide low voltage upgrade was comple
ted Fall 2013 using Measure J funds.  This included intercoms, fire 
and intrusion alarms.
 
 
The Board of Education and the Superintendent's policy is to ensure that all students are provided with a safe and well
-
maintained learning environment. The board ap
proved resolutions in 1998 and 2002 to adequately fund maintenance 
activities and preserve the repairs and improvements funded by two facility bond measures. The school buildings, 
classrooms and grounds are safe, clean and functional. An inspection of the 
facility was conducted in August  2019 and 
determined that there were no unsafe conditions that required emergency repairs. District maintenance staff ensures 
that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a
 
timely manner. A 
computer automated work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs and health and 
safety repairs are given the highest priority. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards and custodial staffin
g 
requirements for all schools in the district. This school meets the Board's standards for custodial staffing and cleanliness.
 
The school's custodians are trained in the proper use of cleaning chemicals and Integrated Pest Management techniques. 
They are 
managed day to day by the Principal with assistance from the district's maintenance department. The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, with funding allocated for major repair or replacement 
of existing school building c
omponents. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. Annually the district budgets $2 million dollars for deferred 
maintenance activities.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

Greer School recognizes parents as integral partners and advocates for the education of all children. Our parents are key 
in planning and implementing our school program. Parents actively participate in school governance through membership 
on the School Si
te Council (SSC), and  English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC).  Throughout the year, learning about 
curriculum takes place at Family Learning Nights, focusing on literacy, math, science, testing, technology, writing, and our 
diverse cultures. Additiona
lly, our Greer Neighborhood Learning Project brings staff into our neighborhood apartment 
complexes, offering families an afternoon of fun learning games, free supplies, and community resources. Parent 
volunteers are always welcome and support the school p
rogram by working in the classrooms, chaperoning on field trips, 
and participating in school events. An events calendar inviting parents is distributed in the monthly parent newsletter. 
Teachers communicate through classroom newsletters, messaging apps, em
ail, and voicemail. A parent resource board 
informs families of school and community events and provides resources for parents, and our Parent Resource Room has 
free resources, technology access, and houses our free family library, filled with thousands of
 
books for families to take 
home and keep. The school uses voice mail, Language Line Translation Services, School Messenger, Facebook, and our 
school website to promote two
-
way communication. The learning community of Greer believes that home and school 
pa
rtnerships are the foundation of student success. Parents or community members who wish to participate in leadership 
teams, school committees, school activities, or become a volunteer may contact the principal, Mrs. Amy Rovai Gregory,

Professional development is a key part of the continuous improvement process for educators. The goal of our quality 
professional development is to support the learning of teachers and paraprofessionals to positively impact student 
achievement.  Annually, t
eachers and site administrators participate in professional development in a variety of 
opportunities.  Seventy
-
five minutes per week are dedicated to staff collaboration and training planned by site leadership 
teams. The District also provides a cycle of 
continuous professional development for Administrators through Principal 
Networks as well as Leadership Academies.
 
 
The District provides professional development opportunities for teachers and administrators that support the 
implementation of Common Core 
State Standards in English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and the 
ELA/ELD Framework.  Specific professional development initiatives include: Culturally Responsive Practices, Critical 
Literacy, TK
-
2 Reading, Supporting Independence and
 
Engagement through Reading and Writing, Math to the Core, 
Expository Reading and Writing Course, and ELD Foundations.  District departments, Center for Teacher Support, grant
-

ing opportunities.  Professional 
development opportunities are voluntary for teachers and are provided throughout the year in a variety of formats: during 
the school day, after school, on Saturdays, and during summer and vacation breaks. Many teachers and 
administrators 
also take advantage of opportunities with Sacramento County Office of Education, California Department of Education, 
the college/university programs, state/national education organizations, and private educational institutes.
 
 
What grounds t
he professional development in the district is the District Strategic Plan and the Local Control 
Accountability Plan. Professional Development is further determined using one or more of the following: (a) student 
achievement data, (b) staff survey data, an
d (c) district
-
identified goals.  Professional development addresses the Common 
Core State Standards, teaching strategies, curriculum, assessment, technology, classroom management, safety, and 
leadership. Administrator training accompanies professional dev
elopment in district focus areas, providing 
implementation support for teachers on site.  Content
-
area coaches are available at some schools.  Additional classroom 
support is provided to new and struggling teachers by consulting teachers from the Center fo
r Teacher Support.
