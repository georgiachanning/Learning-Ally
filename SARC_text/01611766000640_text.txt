School Description
 
Welcome to Harvey Green School! Our school has a long history of serving our neighborhood, and 
many of the parents of our students were once students at Green themselves. Our school is named 
for the fi
rst teacher in Fremont, honoring the tradition of improving lives through education. All 
members of the Green community share our school vision: In order to prepare all students for 
success in college and career, we provide an educational environment that 
challenges and 
motivates all students. To achieve this, we believe our mission is to develop students who will learn 
at high levels of achievement and be compassionate contributors to society by:
 

 
developing a growth mindset
 

 
providing a wide range of 
meaningful, rigorous and engaging experiences
 

 
encouraging a respectful environment and teach social
-
emotional skills
 

 
collaboration amongst students, staff and families
 
 
Our unique blend of cultures, talents, and support services provides an academically ch
allenging, 
safe, and nurturing environment, which allows each and every child on our campus to thrive. Our 
approximately 500 students represent more than two dozen nationalities and a wide variety of 
languages. Awareness and appreciation of diverse backgro
unds and traditions are interwoven into 
the curriculum and school wide activities. We consider students for whom we have special concerns 
as individuals with both strengths and needs. Approximately 30 percent of our students are eligible 
for the free or re
duced
-
price lunch program and 22 percent are English Learners. 
 
 
Our students with disabilities benefit from a similarly innovative set of programs. Our Resource 
Specialist Program (RSP) staff uses a collaborative model to help students within the regular 
classroom setting and in the RSP center. We offer speech and language support services to our 
elementary students and to eligible preschool students from across the district.
 
 
Our counseling enriched program for students diagnosed with severe emotional dis
turbances 
operates as a school within a school. The program, a partnership between Fremont Unified School 
District and Seneca Center blends mental health services with academic instruction for students 
whose emotional needs interfere with their success in 
learning in a full
-
time general education 
classroom.
 
 
We are solidly focused on implementing the California State Standards. We continue to examine 
and modify our teaching practices to ensure that each student is ready for success in junior high, 
high scho
ol, college, and their career. The excitement around this change is palpable; both students 
and teachers emerge from lessons energized and excited about the learning that is taking place.
 
 
We consider education a partnership between school and home, and we
 
invite parents into the 
school as volunteers and participants in school decision
-
making processes. We offer parent 
education and family nights, and have an active PTA and School Site Council. Programs run by the 
PTA, such as our Math Club, Debate Club, Sc
ience Clubs and more, enrich our students' educations 
outside the school day. We seek to weave the many strands of our school community into a bright 
and vibrant tapestry that encompasses the well
-
being of all our students.
 
 
Our school is moving in sustain
able directions, taking advantage of technology. Information is 
shared with families and the community through our school web site and email. Families receive 
our newsletter electronically, saving hundreds of sheets of paper each year. Email is used 
extens
ively to communicate with parents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have
 
enough books in core classes for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of 
Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The main campus buildings were built in 1959. They include the office, the staff room, 18 classrooms, a library, a computer l
ab, and a dedicated science 
lab. In addition, there are two portable classrooms on the main
 
campus as well as eight portable buildings that constitute the Counseling Enriched 
classroom complex.
 
 
We have one day custodian and one night custodian who keep our facilities clean. Each first through sixth grade classroom is 
cleaned every other day. 
Th
e kindergarten classrooms and all restrooms are cleaned every day. District maintenance tends to the landscaping and maintena
nce issues on a regular 
schedule and as needed to address urgent needs.
 
 
At the end of the summer of 2014, the computer lab receive
d a new floor. One classroom's floor was partially replaced to address termite concerns. Both 
the boys and girls bathrooms on our primary playground were renovated to address a problem with a plumbing leak. District pai
nters have been 
repainting walls, doo
rs, and building exterior trim as needed. We have installed an area for a fresh garden in front of the office over the summer
 
of 2015.
 
 
In 2012
-
2013, the district installed a robust, campus
-
wide wireless internet system. Many classrooms held fundraising dr
ives to add computers and iPads. 
In 2013
-
2014, we added two mobile carts of laptop computers that teachers check out and use in their classrooms. All teachers receive
d an updated 
laptop computer. All classrooms have working document cameras and projectors;
 
some also use Apple TV to project from our wireless devices. In 2018 
with the partnership of PTA we were able to increase the amount of technology by providing a chromebook cart per grade level.
 
We continue to update 
and improve our technology as funding 
permits.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction.  Based on
 
that survey, we have answered the questions you see on this 
report. Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report. Since that tim
e, those conditions may have 
changed.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental 
Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parent involvement in daily school operations 
and decision
-
making processes is a fundamental part of our success. Our parent participation on the PTA, 
School Site Council (SSC), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), GATE Advisory Committee, and Disaster/Safety Committee
 
ensures that our 
programs
 
and resources are aligned with our priorities.
 
 
The almost 200 members of our PTA form the backbone of our close
-
knit community. By sponsoring school wide assemblies, they help expand our 

 
literacy, conservation, and social responsibility. In addition, they host a variety of 
community
-
building events, such as our Fall Festival, Cookies and Cocoa with Santa, Bedtime Story Hour, and Family Dinners Out at local
 
restaurants.  
Science and Young 

s very popular 
and successful Math, Debate and Science Clubs. In addition, the PTA brought Music for Minors to our school which is 
run by training parents as docents. 

ften they close the gap, 
helping out with assembly funds or costs associated with fifth grade s
cience camp. They have provided generous support for technology purchases and 
other school improvements such as our marquee. Student safety is another area that is important to our PTA, and they purchase
 
our earthquake supplies 
and update our classroom saf
ety backpacks.
 
 
While the PTA focuses on daily activities and direct support for students, members of our School Site Council (SSC) monitor a
cademic programs and 
selected school budgets. Subcommittees within the SSC oversee the programs for our students wh
o are learning English as their second language,  those 
who have been identified as gifted learners, and programs that support our school library. SSC meets almost every month and a
ll members of the Green 
community are invited to attend. Because members of
 
the SSC oversee some budgets, they have an opportunity to offer input on the expenditure of 
funds at the school level.
 
 
There are also many opportunities for families to be involved in their students' education, including volunteering in classro
oms and at
 
special events like 
our annual Walk
-
a

Thon, supporting fundraisers, and attending Back to School Night and Open House. Please contact our school office if you are 
interested in getting involved!

We revise our School Safety Plan annually; it was last reviewed in November 201
9. The plan includes procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and 
inventories of emergency supplies. We make the plan available on our school web site and keep copies in the office for parent
s. We share the plan with 
all staff during a school wide staff me

unteers u
pdated our 
emergency supplies and our classroom safety backpacks.
 
 
We have a storage container of supplies for use in the event of a prolonged disaster, such as an earthquake. The entire schoo
l regularly practices our 
response to a disaster, 
including how we will deal with medical issues, feeding students who need to stay at school for a long time, and releasing st
udents 
to authorized adults.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. 
 
Below is the amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
2017
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations these days a
re sometimes reduced.
