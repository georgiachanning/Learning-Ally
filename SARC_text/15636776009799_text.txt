By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our Mojave Elementary School Vision:
 
 
Through collaboration, professional development, and a solutions
-
based mindset, the Mojave Elementary School staff will 
meet the diverse needs of each an
d every child

academically and behaviorally. 
 
 
Our Mojave Elementary School Mission Statements:
 

 

 

 
A safe and welcoming learning environment will be maintained.
 

 
Lessons will be 
aligned with the Common Core State Standards, using 21st century technology.
 

 
Using Professional Learning Communities, Response to Intervention strategies, and Student Success Teams, 
student achievement gaps will be bridged.
 

 
High
-
quality academic 
services that meet the ELD standards will be provided for English Learners.
 

 
Student attendance, grades, discipline and other data will be closely monitored to establish a preventative 
approach toward struggling students.
 

 
When a problem arises, we will dili
gently seek a solution. What is weak will be remedied, and what is strong 
will be bolstered.
 

 
Accurate achievement and behavior data will be shared frequently with students, staff members, and 
stakeholders.
 

 
Everyone will have a voice, and input will be soug
ht out frequently.
 

 
Parent involvement will be highly encouraged through School Site Council, the English Language Advisory 
Committee, family events, Parent
-
Portal participation, and volunteering opportunities.
 

 
Positive Behavior Intervention and Support (PB
IS) will be implemented to meet the social, emotional and 
behavioral needs of students in order to decrease suspensions/expulsions, and increase instructional time.
 
For the past 150 years Mojave has been a place of extremes. Traveling two hours in any dire
ction from the town can get 
you to the Pacific Ocean, towering snow
-
packed mountains, or the fertile soil of the central valley. For that reason, Mojave 
has always been an important place in moving things through and getting things done. This was certainly
 
true throughout 
its history, when it was a depot for the railroads, a stopping point for the 20
-
mule teams, and a construction headquarters 
for the Los Angeles Aqueduct. Whether it was gold prospectors, clean
-
energy proponents, or aerospace pioneers, Moja
ve 
has continued to be a magnet for innovators and people with a vision for the future. 
 
 
Throughout it all, education has always been a need in our small town. In 1884 a school opened serving 13 students. Now, 
in 2020, Mojave Elementary School serves a po
pulation of approximately 454 students that come from a town population 
of 4,238 (according to the most recent census). We are a school wide Title 1 program that serves a diverse population: 
35% African American, 48% Hispanic/Latino, 11% White, and 6% from
 
other ethnic groups. 17% of our students are English 
Learners, and over 90% are Socioeconomically Disadvantaged.

Mojave Elementary School offers an educational experience from transitional kindergarten through the fifth grade level. 
These pupils are ser
ved by fifteen regular classroom teachers, and three Special Education teachers. Mojave Elementary 
School is also home to the Center for the Advancement of Regionalized Exceptional Students (C.A.R.E.S.), which serves 
over 50 students and utilizes five full
 
time teachers. The school complex has 30 classrooms, an auditorium, a cafeteria, a 
library, 1 computer lab and four "mobile labs" consisting of laptops and tablets which are fully utilized. Four out of five o
f 
the C.A.R.E.S. classrooms are housed in a cou
nty wing of classrooms with accessible restrooms and facilities; the 5th 
classroom is integrated into the kindergarten wing and serves pre
-
k and kindergarten students. 
 
 
Before Kindergarten, many of our students attend the First Five/Play
-
and
-
Learn pre
-
sch
ool and the county operated Head 
Start pre
-
school program adjacent to our campus. Upon successful completion of the fifth grade, students are promoted 
to the sixth grade at Mojave Junior/Senior High School . It is our expectation that the educational found
ation and social 
experiences attained at Mojave Elementary School will assist the students in becoming successful and productive citizens.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP]
 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight
 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant co
gnitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or program
s 
of study.

Professional development needs are determined by thorough analysis of student achievement data and needs 
assessments conducted throughout the year.  Staff development also takes place throughout the school year during the 
early release days which occur eve
ry Wednesday of each week.  These early release days have been scheduled to allow 
teachers an opportunity to collaborate, plan for instruction and standards integration, analyze data, and continue with 
on
-
going staff development as a professional learning 
community (PLC).  Staff development needs are often a result of 
the continual formal and informal classroom observations conducted by the principal.
 
 
Teachers are also provided opportunities to attend workshops, training, and conferences during the summer 
and school 
year outside the school setting. Recent PD has included training in Implementing the ELD standards, Positive Behavior 
Intervention and Support (PBIS), SMART Board Technology in the classroom, grading and attendance software, and 
student engageme
nt. Several teachers over the past three years have also participated in professional development 
related to Marzano's High Reliability Schools model. Based on local formative assessments and benchmark testing, 
professional development must facilitate the 
academic achievement of all students in English Language Arts, 
Mathematics, Social Studies, and Science.
 
 
During the 2016
-
17 School year MES utilized math coaches hired through Math Solutions. Additional training was provided 
for all teachers on how to use
 
the new assessments software "School City."
 
 
At the beginning of the 2017
-
18 school year all teachers attended a Renaissance Place training to help facilitate full 
implementation and fidelity to that program.
 
 
At the beginning of the 2018
-
19 school year w
e had a PBIS refresher with Heather Robbins.  On September 22, 2018 we 
had a PD on "How the African

American Experience Affects the Classroom and Strategies for Success" by Dr. Frierson of 
the Aha Process.  On October 5th, 2019 there was a PD on Universal 
Design for Learning by Dr. Erin Dolin.  And on January 
7th, we had a PD on Trauma Informed Practices by Jennifer Johnston.
 
 
During the 2019
-
20 school year we have had two professional development days on implementing the Time to Teach 
program for improving
 
classroom management and for increasing the student engagement level along with the level of 
school connectedness.
