By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Spring Grove School is the only school in the North County J
oint Union School District, located in the rural area of northern 
San Benito County. Spring Grove School serves an area of approximately 100 square miles. The 2018
-
2019 CALPADS report 
shows an enrollment of 720 students, in Transitional Kindergarten throug
h eighth grades. Of these 720 students 432 (60%) 
are Hispanic, and 239 (33.19%) are white. The remaining 49 (6.81%) students include American Indian, Asian, African 
American and students with multiple ethnicity/races.
 
 
The school population is comprised of
 
students whose families can trace their roots back to the abandoned one
-
room 
schoolhouses still visible in our district. Students come from generations of farming and ranching families. We also have 
students whose families migrated here from Mexico. In ad
dition, there has been an influx of families that have moved 
here from outside of the county. The common element, however, is a belief in quality public education and high academic 
expectations.

ucation population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs
 
items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses tha
t satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are actively in
volved in their children's education at Spring Grove School through membership in the Parent 
Teacher Organization, School Site Council, Asset Building Champions 
-
 
Anti Bully Program, English Learner Advisory 
Committee (ELAC) and the Migrant Parent Advisory
 
Committee. In addition, parents help out as classroom and school 
volunteers, guest speakers, and at special events. Parents have had multiple opportunities to contribute ideas during the 
development of the District's LCAP through surveys and meetings. As 
Common Core math strategies began to raise 
questions, the District continued to offer several math information workshops to help parents understand the shifts that 
were occurring. These math nights provided parents with strategies that they could use to as
sists their children with math 
homework. The District has also added parent training on reading strategies, digital citizenship, cyber
-
bullying, and 
cannabis.
 
 
Although parents are provided with many opportunities to be connected, parent involvement remain
s at top priority at 
Spring Grove School. Spring Grove is committed to improving communication with parents through providing translation 
of all information, keeping the school and District website as current as possible, and using social media.
 
 
The 
Spring Grove Parent Teacher Organization meets monthly on campus and hosts many annual fundraising and 
community events. The annual Wine and Roses Benefit helps raise the much needed funds the PTO uses to provide 
academic programs i.e: field trips, Reading
 
Counts, campus beautification, and computer programs. Funds raised by the 
PTO also help to provide improved technology in the classrooms, teacher wish lists, sport teams uniforms and facility 
enhancements like benches, trees, landscaping and other campus 
beautification items. Additionally, Spring Grove PTO 
hosts a Fall Festival, fund raisers, Bingo Nights, Scholastic Book Fairs, and many other community events. The PTO enjoys 
encouraging and supporting staff, children and parents at Spring Grove.
 
 
The Spri
ng Grove PTO is always seeking new members. More information regarding the Parent Teacher Organization and 
how they support Spring Grove can be found by visiting their website www.springgrovepto.com

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Spring Grove School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, parents and the community. A team of 5
 
custodial/grounds staff take pride in maintaining an organized, clean, and safe facility. A scheduled maintenance program 
is administered by the school in order to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are clean and well maintained. It is the 
goal of 
Spring Grove School to provide a safe, respectful environment for students as they learn.
 
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Spring Grove School. Spring Grove School school has a secure 
campus with fencing surrounding the entire camp
us. All gates are closed and locked during the school day. All classrooms 
and office buildings are equipped with columbine locks. Additional lighting has been installed in the main areas of the 
campus to provide more security. To further secure the campus,
 
each classroom and adjoining doors have been equipped 
with a "123 Lock
-
Down Latch" which can be used in a Lockdown or emergency situation.
 
 
The school is in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials, and state earth
quake 
standards. The Disaster Preparedness Plan is a key element in the School Safety Plan. It includes steps for ensuring student 
and staff safety during a disaster. Fire, earthquake, and lock down drills are held on a regular basis throughout the school 
year. Emergency Plans and evacuation procedures are posted in each classroom and a five minute safety in
-
service is 
presented to the staff at each staff meeting. Yard duty staff are equipped with two way radios for communication and 
First Aid kits while on
 
duty to maximize student safety on a daily basis. Annually, fibar is brought into the kindergarten and 
primary play structures to accommodate the underground playground safety code. A safety committee reviews and 
updates the safety plan and reports to the
 
School Site Council.
 
 
Having clear discipline policies and procedures as well as effective supervision is essential. All visitors on campus are 
required to sign
-
in at the school office and proceed directly to their designated area.
