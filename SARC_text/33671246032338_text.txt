Mission Statement and Goals
 
The mission and vision for Sunnymead Elementary School is to hold high expectations for all 
students and to identify essential factors for educational success at all levels. Sunnymead 
Elementary School emphasizes
 
the importance of including equity as a criterion for excellence in a 
diverse population of learners. We commit to promoting fairness, positive interactions, and 
personal safety while fostering the development of student's analytical and critical thinking
 
skills. 
Our vision is to increase student learning as determined by the interaction between home, school, 
and the community in an environment where teachers will utilize research
-
based, proactive 
instructional strategies and resources to support high expe
ctations.  WE DREAM, WE BELIEVE, WE 
ACHIEVE; WE ARE SHINING STARS.
 
 
By building and maintaining a partnership amongst our staff, parents, and community members, 
we will continue to excel and improve Sunnymead Elementary. With this goal in mind, I wish to 
e
xtend an invitation to all our parents to be part of their child's education by becoming actively 
involved in Parent Teacher Association (PTA), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), School 
Site Council (SSC), African American Parent Advisory Council 
 
and other school events. I assure you 
that through this participation, you will feel more connected to the school and our students.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which de
scribes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information a
bout SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.
