By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Shoal Creek Elementary School, built in 1998, serves 524 students from Transitional Kindergarten through fifth grade, 
including 36 students in special day classes, from a rich diversity of cultural, ethnic and linguistic backgrounds. Additi
onally, 
40 preschool children attend the parent participation program on campus. The pristine campus is located on top of a 
commanding bluff in the residential community of Carmel Mountain Ranch. Although Shoal Creek is still a relatively new 
school, we ha
ve attained the distinction of being identified as a California Distinguished School in 2002. The expertise of 
the staff, the dedication of the parents and the enthusiasm of the students have formed a professional learning community 
where all partners coll
aborate together toward the common goal of doing what is best for children and their learning. The 

the focus, creativity is encouraged, eac

 
 
There are 21 certificated, regular education teachers, three special day class teachers and a resource specialist, and speech
 
and language specialist employed on site. There is one part
-
time preschool teache
r,
 
two impact teachers and one English 
Language Learner instructional aide. Our itinerant staff includes a resource specialist, speech specialist, an adapted 
physical education teacher, occupational therapist, school psychologist, and band director. There 
are 38 classified 
personnel including office staff, custodians, library media assistant, itinerant computer technician, physical education 
instructional assistant, special education instructional assistants, student services aides and specialists, noon dut
y 
supervisors, food services supervisors and extended student services supervisors.
 
 
 
Fifteen percent
 
of the student population are enrolled in the English Language Learner (ELL) Program. Fifty
-
six percent of 
our student population is Caucasian, and the la
rgest minority group is made up of students from various Asian 
backgrounds at twenty
-
two percent. The students speak twenty
-
five languages. Thirty students are enrolled in the 
Resource Specialist Program (RSP). Thirty
-
six students are enrolled in our speci
al day classes, and seventy
-
two receive 
speech and language services. Students with special needs are served according to their Individualized Education Plan 
(IEP).
 
Thirty
-
six students in grades two through five are identified as Gifted and Talented. Ten p
ercent of the student 
population receive free or reduced lunch.
 
 
Classroom teachers have been trained in differentiating instruction for all of 
the above
-
mentioned populations. We also offer a variety of class placement options each year which may include 
two
-
year looping classes, multi
-
grade and single grade
-
level classes. A two
-
year kindergarten program is also offered for 
students with late summer and fall birthdays.
 
 
The parents of Shoal Creek are an invaluable resource in supporting school programs. Vo
lunteers help in the classroom 
and with school
-
wide events throughout the year. In addition, the P.T.A. supports a variety of activities and programs 
throughout the school year, including school assemblies, the monthly newsletter and weekly bulletin, a har
vest festival, 
parent/child events and guest readers. Also they have assisted with community service drives. Shoal Creek has established 
an Educational Foundation to raise funds for the betterment of education at the site. Foundation events include Parents

Night Out, monthly "Dinner Out" events, and our weekly Otter Caf√©.
 
 
We find that one of our greatest assets is our strong parent/student/staff relationship that maximizes student 
achievement. This is the embodiment of what a professional learning communi
ty can produce. We have a low staff 
turnover, enabling smoother transitions and communication. The staff continues to seek research
-
based strategies that 
support student learning through ongoing training. Our Student Council and the community are active wi
th service 
projects for our school, as well as projects that benefit the outside community.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Poway Unified School District ensures that students 
attend clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each of its schools is maintained in good repair.  A work 
order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and well m
aintained.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A night custodial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms and offices daily.  
The district has adopted cleaning standards for all schools.  A summary of these standards is availab
le at the district offices.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Research supports the positive effects professional development has on increasing student learning. All teaching staff is 
afforded the opportunity to participate in district and site sponsored 
professional development.  These workshops are 
presented in a semester or year
-
long series and support a wide variety of professional development. These include the 
use of effective instructional strategies, implementing the use of computer technology in t
eaching and learning, critical 
reading, writing and mathematics strategies, effective use of assessments, positive discipline in
-
services, and multicultural 
training. Teachers and administrators are actively involved in professional development activities 
at the school, district, 
state, and national level.  The Poway Professional Assistance Program (PPAP) provides support for new teachers. Teachers 
are encouraged to participate in the National Board Certification process and recognized by the Poway Unified 
School 
District when they earn NBCT status.
