School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Updated and readily available resources are important if students are to perform at their best in class. The State of 
California adopts textbooks that meet quality standards established b
y the State Board of Education and aligned to the 
newly adopted California Common Core State Standards (CCCSS). The Chico Unified School District selects textbooks and 
other instructional materials from these state adoptions. All of the textbooks currently
 
in use meet these standards. They 
were selected to match the needs of Chico students by a Task Force comprised of teachers and administrators and 
approved by the Board of Education. The CUSD convenes curricular task forces to review textbooks in core subj
ect areas 
on the Kindergarten through 8th grade state adopted list concurrent with the adoption cycle. These standards aligned 
textbooks are in the hands of all students within two years of adoption.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The original Chapman School was built in 1953. In 
1989 this section of the school was remodeled with state reconstruction 
funds. As enrollment increased over the years, the school expanded from the original ten classrooms to its current size of 
twenty
-
one classrooms. Since 1986 there have been ten relocat
able classrooms erected on the campus. During the 1994
-
95 school year three relocatable rooms were added to house the Healthy Start, Even Start and Head Start Programs.  These 
classrooms have since been converted into a State Preschool and Special Educatio
n classrooms.  Cleaning the common 
areas of the school takes place on a daily basis. Classrooms are also cleaned on a daily basis. Routine maintenance and 
safety checks take place daily.  New asphalt was poured during the summer of 2015.  New playgrounds f
or both 
TK/Kindergarten yard and 1
-
5 grade yard were installed during the 16
-
17 school year. 14 new air conditioning units were 
installed and the holes in the asphalt between the two main buildings were fixed and landscaped last year. Chapman 
received an e
xemplary status on the 18/19 Facility Inspection Tool. A Charter school moved onto the Chapman campus at 
the beginning of the 16/17 school year. The Charter school occupies nine classrooms on campus.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority:
 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Cali
fornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alterna
te achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for 
entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

imminent danger procedure, code red, evacuation/relocation procedure, civil defense/disorder, bomb threat/bomb 
emergency, earthquake, chemical spill, crime in progress and fire/exp

procedures list located in each classroom.  Chapman staff and students regularly practice fire and earthquake drills and 
Code Red lock

after school. All visitors must 
check in at the office when on our campus and obtain a visitor badge. Security lights and cameras have been updated and 
allow for better monitoring of the campus. The entire campus is fenced in and the gates are locked duri
ng school hours. 
Any person entering the campus, without a key, is forced to go through the main hallway.
