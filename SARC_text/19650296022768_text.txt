School Description
 
As you read this report, we believe that you will find that what emerges is a picture of a school with a strong academic 
foundation, a parent 
community that is interested and actively involved, a faculty professionally skilled and personally 
committed to meeting the needs of students, and a student body motivated to perform well. The strength of our school lies 
with the staff who are knowledgeab
le, thoughtful and caring and share the belief that all students can learn.
 
 
Arroyo Vista Elementary School is located in the City of South Pasadena, a community of approximately 25,619. The student 
population reflects the ethnic and cultural diversity of 
Southern California. The school was honored as a California 
Distinguished School in 2004 and 2010 and was named a National Blue Ribbon School in 2005 and again in 2019. Arroyo 
Vista was named a Gold Ribbon School in 2015 and again in 2017.
 
 
Arroyo Vista is
 
a unique mix of cultures. We are widely supported by our greater community, resulting in a dedicated team 
bound together by our core values of respect, integrity, and diversity. The intense value we place on educating our children 
is the driving force beh

instruction to meet 
the individual learning needs of their students. Recognizing the need to focus on the whole child, our 

communication and collaboration skill

In our longstanding tradition of excellence, we maintain our commitment to students, parents, community members, and 
staff to provide the best educational experience possible. We renew this commitment yearly in hopes that together, we will 
continue our
 
effectiveness in educating our students and preparing them for the challenges of their future. As always, we 
welcome any suggestions, ideas, and comments you may have. Together, we have strived toward excellence and earned 
the honor of becoming a Californ
ia Distinguished School, a Gold Ribbon School, and a National Blue Ribbon School.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities);

Annually, four staff development days are scheduled into the school year 
to address 
both site and district level needs. These professional 

and Strategic Plan.  The AV staff, along with the other two elementary 
school staffs, participate in all District offered staff d
evelopment. Some 
topics that have been addressed include the evaluation of student writing, 
the examination of multiple measures, differentiated learning strategies, 
Thinking Maps, Smartboard technology, Project
-
Based Learning (PBL), and 
Common Core State 
Standards.  This year's training will focus on the 
ELA/ELD curriculum and materials, writing standards, Next Generation 
Science Standards, and student anxiety/mindfulness.
 
 
Staff development is delivered at monthly faculty meetings, during grade 
level rele
ase time and through attendance at various conferences. 
Professional development opportunities offer teachers the opportunity to 
collaborate with one another about their curriculum, instruction, and 
assessments; to share best practices with colleagues; and
 
to discuss ways 

have participated in Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI) training provided 
by the UCLA math institute.  As a means of meeting Next Generation 
Science Standards, a
ll of our teachers were trained in Project Lead the Way 
(Launch) units.  Teachers have been encouraged to participate in Writers 
Workshop training.
 
 
Teachers are supported through their Path I (feedback after formal 
observations) and Path II  (plan to addr
ess teacher standards agreed upon 
by teacher and principal) plans.  Additionally, grade
-
level meetings, data 
analysis meetings, and peer planning meetings allow teachers to learn 
from their peers.

AV has a rich heritage as a
 
cherished neighborhood school, and the strong, supportive partnership we have with our families and our community is based 
on our shared commitment to nurturing the intellectual, emotional, and social growth of all of our students and to celebratin
g the e
thnic and cultural 
diversity that makes us so unique. Our shared desire for genuine collaboration, our commitment to respectful, open communicat
ion, and our belief in 
the importance of acting with integrity are not just strategies but are part of our core 
values and have resulted in high levels of parent participation in 
and community support for our school.
 
 

hildren do better 
academi
cally and emotionally when the adults in their lives work in unison. Engagement begins with our open campus policy, which enc
ourages parents 
to walk their children to school. Each fall, we launch a new specific yearlong partnership with our Back to School 
Night (average attendance rate is 98%). 
Parents have the opportunity to meet each other and see the classroom, and teachers are able to share curriculum goals, behav
ioral expectations, 
communication methods, and volunteer opportunities for the current year
. Parents are invited to work in the classroom as small group reading assistants, 
art docents, Second Step lesson leaders, field trip chaperones, and library assistants. In addition, parents are encouraged t
o share cultural traditions and 
career experience
s and are invited to help with and/or attend class performances throughout the year. In order to maintain engagement througho
ut the 
year, AV teachers write weekly and/or monthly newsletters, post updates on school and class websites, respond to parent note
s, calls, or emails within 
24 hours, provide progress reports, and conduct Parent / Teacher Conferences in the fall and spring.
 
 
The School Site Council and PTA are integral entities for involving parents in school programs that support the development o
f 
the whole child. Each year, 
parents in both groups organize numerous fundraisers, schedule amazing schoolwide performances and assemblies, and organize a
nnual or bi
-
annual 
events such as Science Fair/STEM Expo, Family Movie and Music Nights, Book Fairs, th
e AV Gives Back volunteer day, and the Market Place (a craft 
fair/business opportunity for AV students). The PTA also sponsors frequent parent education nights focused on academic as wel
l as social and emotional 
ways to support our students. In addition, A
V parents play a key role in involving the larger community in supporting our school in our educational 
foundation (SPEF), and they also have worked tirelessly to pass numerous bonds to renovate all our facilities as well as a pa
rcel tax that allows us to 
offer 
smaller class sizes. AV parents also reach out to the larger community for Read Across America Week, Family Science Night, an
d Red Ribbon Week in 
order to ensure that all classes have access to awesome readers and speakers at these events. Parents ha
ve also helped teachers get community members 
from the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), the Water Department, the Tournament of Roses Royal Court, and local markets to help launc
h and/or serve as 
authentic audiences for student projects such as the kindergarten r
ollercoaster challenge and the 5th Grade Annual State Float Parade. Without the 
amazing support of our parents and community, we would not be able to provide such a rich and well
-
rounded learning experience for our students. AV 
is proof that it really does

School Safety Plan
 
Arroyo 
Vista is a very warm, cheerful, child
-
centered school with a rich history of excellence.  There is a focus on activities that are healthy, engaging, and 
challenging before, during, and after school. The staff shares a common set of beliefs about learning a
nd student engagement, which drives every decision 
we make and is the foundation for the positive family and community
-
oriented culture at our school. You can see and feel the positive school culture as 

ls, in the students and staff, and in every classroom. Both students and faculty feel comfortable, 
cared for, and safe at school. The safety of students and staff is a primary concern at Arroyo Vista Elementary.
 
 
The staff strives to develop the social and
 
emotional needs of students through the PBIS (Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports) program. The 
focus of the PBIS program is to create students who are emotionally and socially strong.  PBIS methods are research
-
based and proven to significantl
y 
reduce the occurrence of problem incidents in the school, resulting in a more positive school climate and increased academic 
performance. We have 
successfully implemented a schoolwide positive
-
behavior program. Using PBIS as our guide, Arroyo Vista staff
 
has developed behavior expectations for 
common areas around the school. Classroom and common
-
area behavior expectations are framed around core ideas, which serve as our High Five Rules: 
Be Safe, Be Cooperative, Be Responsible, Be Respectful, and Be Kind. 
The school is in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations about hazardous 

ff safety during a disaster.  
Practice drills for
 
fire, earthquakes, and other emergencies are held with the staff and students on a monthly basis. Emergency kits are located 
in all 
classrooms, and additional emergency supplies are stored on
-
site. As part of our safety plan, we have established emergency
 
response teams, each with 
specific responsibilities, so that we respond effectively and efficiently in the event of a crisis situation. The monitoring 
of school grounds is performed by 
assigned staff before, during, and after school. All visitors must rep

sign out upon leaving the campus.

For the past several years, the Arroyo Vista student population has included a significant number of students that have sever
e and 
life
-
threatening 
allergies to peanuts and peanut products. Some of these students are affected by trace amounts of peanuts in our breath, in t
he air or oil left on a table. 
Because of the high number of students throughout all grade levels with this health
 
issue and because we, the school, are required by law, to ensure a 
safe environment for all students, Arroyo Vista became a Peanut Free Zone in 2005.  The staff is trained on a regular basis o
n the signs and symptoms of 
allergic reactions as well as how t
o administer an Epi
-
pen. Other safeguards have also been put in place throughout the campus to ensure that all staff 
members can assist students with peanut allergies.
 
 
The Comprehensive Safety Plan is updated annually by the school administration and stak
eholders in consultation with local law enforcement to comply 
with Senate Bill 187 of 1997.   The plan provides students and staff a means to ensure a safe and orderly learning environmen
t. Components of the 
Comprehensive Safety Plan include child abuse re
porting procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress from school, 
sexual harassment policy, and dress code policy. Arroyo Vista Elementary reviews the plan annually and updates it as needed. 
Our Safety Plan is updated 
in
 
the fall each year and shared with staff, parents and the School Site Council.  All stakeholders give input on improving scho
ol safety. An updated copy 
of the plan is available to the public in the school office.
