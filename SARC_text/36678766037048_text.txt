By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Muscoy Elementary School has 32 permanent classrooms and 4 portable classrooms 
which include a music room, a 
Response to Intervention room, a parent resource room, and a computer lab.  Additionally, the school has a portable pre
-
school, a library, multi
-
purpose room, psychologist office, speech therapist office, and an administrative
 
office.  The 
campus was built in 1946 and was modernized in 1990.  In 2014, the school received a new two
-
story building containing 
12 classrooms and a new kindergarten room.  In 2017, we transferred our administrative offices to what had been part of 
our
 
library in order to make our school secure and upgrade the safety features. The facilities encourage community 
involvement and student creativity, collaboration, critical thinking, and communication throughout our vast campus, 
providing ample space for in
struction and recreation.

scores.

ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula

Date Last Reviewed with Faculty:  Aug. 5, 2019
 
 
Every 
student and teacher has the right to attend a school free from physical and psychological harm. To help schools 
achieve these vital goals, the State of California has mandated that each K
-
12 school develop a comprehensive school 
safety plan.  Reviewed annu

local public safety agencies, community leaders, parents, pupils, teachers, administrators, and other persons interested 
in the prevention of campus crime and v

preparedness, mitigation and prevention, response and recovery.
 
 
In close cooperation with the California Schools Risk Management (Joint
-
Powers Authority), local police and fire 
depart

sites and provides correction reports to site administrators.  A follow
-
up system is in place to ensure timely compliance 
and correction of dis
crepancies.
 
 
School sites also conduct scheduled drills for anticipated emergency situations (such as fires, earthquakes and lockdowns) 
to prepare students, staff, and other stakeholders how to appropriately respond to those emergencies. The district 
follows 

System (NIMS) for emergency management.  The Office of Safety and Emergency Management is also tasked with 
coordinating the response and reco
very of emergencies or other disasters affecting the SBCUSD.

The California Department of Education issued

19 report cards.
 
 
Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
The common goal of all categorically funded programs in the 
San Bernardino City Unified School District (SBCUSD) is to 
ensure that all students
--
including English learners, educationally disadvantaged pupils, African American, Hispanic English 
only, gifted and talented pupils, and pupils with exceptional needs
--
att
ain mastery of state and local standards.
 
 
The educational program at each site is based on an improvement planning process that includes members of the school 
community such as the principal, teachers, support staff, parents, and students (at the secondar
y level). These 
stakeholders form the School Site Council (SSC). The SSC develops and annually monitors, evaluates and revises a plan 
called the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA). The SPSA, based on self
-
study and collaboration, ensures that all 
o
f the resources available to the school are coordinated and focused on providing a high
-
quality educational program in 
which all students can achieve success.
 
 
Some students have difficulty mastering academic state and local content standards. They may be 
at risk of not meeting 
graduation requirements. For these students, categorical program funds are provided. Categorical funds are supplemental 
educational dollars used for supports that augment the core instructional program and increase the academic succe
ss of 
these students. Categorical funds provide items such as additional personnel time, staff development opportunities, 
supplemental student materials, and other specialized services, equipment, and supplies.
 
 
Categorical programs commonly found at SBCUS
D sites are:
 

 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Title I, Part A
 

 
Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF)
 
 
Additionally, categorical programs have been established at the district level to provide important services and 
instructional support that help increase s
tudent success. Categorical funds in this category support District efforts in the 
areas of:
 

 
Vocational Education Basic Grant Award (Voc Ed) 

 
Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement 
Act of 2006
 

 
ESSA Title II, Part A 

 
Supporting Effecti
ve Instruction
 

 
ESSA Title III, Part A 

 
Language Instruction for English Learners (EL) and Language Instruction for Immigrant 
Students
 
 
Continuous Improvement
 
LEAs are encouraged to use evidence
-
based interventions that are reasonable, necessary, and consi
stent with Title I, Part 
A of the ESSA, to improve student achievement for those students not meeting grade level standards. At the local level, 
SBCUSD identifies schools with greatest needs, based on a variety of data, including local and state student pr
ogress 
indicators, to provide additional resources and services to the schools (referred to as Targeted Support for School Progress 
or TSSP). Additionally, the California Dashboard is used to identify schools and student groups in need of Comprehensive 
Sup
port and Improvement (CSI), Targeted Support and Improvement (TSI), and Additional Targeted Support and 
Improvement (ATSI).
