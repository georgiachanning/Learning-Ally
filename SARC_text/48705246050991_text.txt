School Description
 
 
Mary Farmar Elementary School is named for long
-
time Benicia teacher, Mary Farmar
, who taught 
for 33 years before retiring in 1922. She was widely known and appreciated for her dedication to 
her teaching, and for being an inspiration to all her students. The first school in Benicia, West End 
Grammar School, was fondly known as "Miss Fa
rmar's School". Over fifty years ago, when the 
current campus was built, it was rightfully named to honor Mary E. Farmar, an outstanding teacher 
and community member.
 
 
Our school site overlooks the beautiful Carquinez Strait, offering the best bay view in 
Benicia. Also, 
our campus is adjacent to the Benicia High School campus,which supports collaborative work 
between staff and students from each site. Teaching Pathways Program allows high school students 
interested in becoming teachers, to work in Mary Farm
ar classrooms.
 
 
Mary Farmar Elementary School is a dedicated, caring school, working hard every day to provide 
students with foundational knowledge. We provide instruction in higher
-
level, critical thinking 
(analysis, synthesis, evaluation), and work conti
nuously to help all our students become 
academically proficient in math, reading, and writing. To accomplish this goal, we provide 
differentiated instruction and academic intervention supporting the diverse needs of our students 
through research
-
based stra
tegies. Our staff collaborates to determine students' needs and then 
develops instruction to respond to individual student needs. We provide music for grades 1
-
3, and 
PE and weekly music for our fourth and fifth grade students. We expect meaningful, achiev
ement
-
oriented communication among all stakeholders, including staff, administration, parents, and 
community members.
 
 
Our staff is also dedicated to supporting the social
-
emotional growth of our students alongside 
their academic growth. Mary Farmar has im
plemented PBIS system of positive discipline, as well as 
Character Counts! Pillars of Character. All our students and staff know our Three B's 
-
 
Be Safe, Be 
Kind, Be Responsible, which connects to all of our behavior expectations. PBIS is facilitated throu
gh 
the site
-
wide implementation of shared expectations, consistent consequences, and ongoing 
problem
-
solving to support positive student behavior for all of our students. Our staff monitors 
students who may need additional support, referring them to the ap
propriate service we have 
available, including early mental health interventions and social skills groups.
 
 
Mary Farmar is fortunate to have a team of dedicated volunteers who work to create unique and 
enriching experiences for our students and their famil
ies. Our students have opportunities to 

gardener. Garden docents help our students learn how their food is grown and how to take care of 
the plants. The Benicia Ed
ucation Foundation supports science, technology, engineering, art, and 
math (STEAM) through a rotating series of classes for our 3rd through 5th grade. There are also 
several different after school programs held on our campus providing a variety of fun and
 
educational enrichment opportunities including art, Lego club, strings instrumental instruction, and 
guitar.

Mary Farmar Elementary is a focal point for our community, providing many school activities supported by our PTA. These commu
nity
-
building events include movie nigh
ts, family dances, harvest dinner, where families can enjoy time together and feel included in our 
community.
 
PTA has supported school
-
wide musical instruction through In Harmony Music. Our Kindergarten through 2nd grade students also enjoy 
a science and d
esign program through Brickspace, supported by our PTA. These activities and programs are constantly evolving to continue 
to inclusive and engaging.
 
 
We have developed the Mary Farmar
 
Safe Passage to School Coalition comprised of school staff, parents, city staff, and Solano County 
Safe Routes to School representatives to continue to resolve traffic safety issues that impact our site. Our efforts have bee
n recognized 
by the Solano Tran
sit Authority.
 
 
Our students reap the benefits of a balanced day of instruction through the dedication of our staff and school community.
 
 
Mission Statement:  Mary Farmar School will provide a safe, stimulating learning environment in which all children wi
ll learn and prepare 
for the opportunity to attend college if they choose. They will develop a respect for themselves and others with sensitivity 
to, and 
appreciation for, cultural and individual diversity.
 
 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condit
ion and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annua
l school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the Calif
ornia 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.
