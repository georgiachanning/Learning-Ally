About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Data driven, 
standards based, strategic staff professional development translates to student achievement. Curriculum and research
-
based professional 
development is focused, sustained and linked to student learning. It requires a deep knowledge of content, a repertoire 
of instructional strategies, 
understanding of student needs and development, and a belief that all students can learn when given the opportunity. Teachers
 
and support staff are 
also given opportunities to collaborate and plan amongst the grade levels as we
ll as vertically to seek best practices and adapt and implement them 
within their own grade level. The Los Altos staff uses the grade level common core state standards, assessment data and distr
ict adopted curriculum to 
guide and drive its instructional fo
cus. Classroom teachers meet with Administrator at least twice a month during collaboration or individually to review 
student data and academic progress in Literacy, Math and Writing.
 
 
Los Altos teachers have participated in numerous trainings, workshops, 
and conferences provided by ESSC, in
-
house school site coaches and outside 
consultants.  The  principal, executive director, resource coaches  plan and deliver training in the area of ELD and Math.  S
taff development offers teachers 
and staff the opportuni
ty to learn and engage in professional dialogue and research. Staff training has included a focus on ELD and Math.  Teachers 
were 
provided support via the side
-
by
-
side coaching model and were given opportunities to learn through grade
-
level PD with the coa
ch. Our school has 
continued to work in the area of conceptual understanding in math.  We have implemented the 3 reads protocol and art currentl
y building capacity in 
the area of questioning.
