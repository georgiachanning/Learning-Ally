School Description
 
Valle Vista Elementary, a school situated at the base of the eastern foothills of San Jose, offers an 
exciting and relevant Common Core
-
based curriculum in a culturally diverse learning environment.
 
 
Valle Vista serves kindergarten through fifth grade Gene
ral Education students, as well as 
kindergarten through fifth grade Special Education students.   Our dedicated staff includes one 
principal,  one secretary, 13 general education teachers, 3 special education teachers, and one 
resource teacher.   In additi
on, the district provides a part
-
time psychologist, health clerk, speech 
therapist, adaptive PE teacher, and family case manager and a library technician. We also have a 
half
-
time counselor provided by Diva Diversity.  The support staff includes our noon d
uties, food 
services workers, two custodians, and 9 instructional assistants. The paraprofessionals are assigned 
as follows:  8 Special Day Class aides and 1 Resource aide.
 
 
Our Vision:  We are committed to developing lifelong learners who strive to reach 
their personal 
best in a diverse and changing world.
 
 
Curriculum and Instruction: Our qualified and dedicated teachers inspire students through focused 
instruction based on the district adopted curriculum and the Common Core State Standards.  We 
implement 
the Eureka Math Common Core Curriculum at all grade levels.  This math program 
challenges students to creatively approach each problem using critical thinking and problem
-
solving strategies.   Our upper grades also teach with the Common Core
-
based Expediti
onary 
Learning.  Expeditionary Learning provides students access to rich literature and novels that are 
analyzed and critiqued in ways that make meaningful connections to students' lives experiences 
and interests.  Report Cards and Progress Reports are pro
vided to parents three times a year. 
Standardized test results are provided to parents in the summer with a follow
-
up interpretation of 
results at the fall parent conference. Student assessment data is gathered every year using 
standardized test results an
d interim assessments.
 
 
Over the past two years, Valle Vista has explored and refined the idea of adopting an art integration 
theme.  This investigative process was facilitated by the Art Integration Committee which consists 
of representatives from adminis
tration, staff, students, and the Santa Clara County Office of 
Education VAPA Coordinator.  As we enter our third year, we strive to implement our integration 
of the arts to cultivate meaningful connections with the curriculum through artistic expression. 
 
One way that we support the arts is through our Project Based Learning Units (PBL's).   Teachers 

-
world problems with meaningful and imaginative solutions. 
Through project
-
based learning, 
students tackle a challenging academic curriculum in ways that are engaging, meaningful, and 
adaptable to a variety of learning styles.  Our goal is to facilitate students in developing skills in 
collaboration, cooperation, 
critical thinking, and creativity.

Our students get to experience technology through our mobile labs, which consist of either Chromebooks and iPads.  Several te
achers on 
staff are part of the Santa Clara County 
Office of Education Digital Storytelling Cohort, where they learn to instruct our students in creative 
projects through digital media.  We are also the first school in Santa Clara County to ever be awarded the prestigious Walt D
isney Family 
Museum Partners
hip.  This partnership provides instruction from industry professionals in animation.  During scheduled after
-
school 
sessions, students can participate in our robotics program and coding cadre.  They are learning basic physics, mechanics, pro
gramming 
and e
ngineering.  Our fifth graders are offered the opportunity to participate each year in Science Camp, a hands
-
on outdoor education 
program.
 
 
Response to Intervention:  We identify students at risk through our RTI process and hold Student Success Team (SST) 
meetings with their 
parents, classroom teacher, family case manager, psychologist, intervention teacher, and principal. We work to analyze each s

individual needs with input from all stakeholders and then create a plan to help the student succeed. 
  
Our protocol is to set a follow
-
up 
meeting to determine the outcome of our plan and strategize next steps. We also provide after
-
school Math Intervention for third
-
grade 
students through Elevate Math and Bay Area Tutors through our after school program.
 
 
After School Program:  We have the Mount Pleasant After School (MPAS) program that serves over 100 students from dismissal to
 
6 p.m. 
in grades kindergarten to fifth grade. This program provides a homework club, physical activities, arts, and enrichment pr
ograms.  The 
students have the opportunity to perform in music and drama presentations, compete in athletics with other schools, and parti
cipate in 
other extra
-
curricular classes such as robotics.
 
 
School Behavior Support:  We are proud of our school and o
ur commitment to quality education.  We have high expectations and believe 
that all children can learn.  Through the PBIS/BEST Framework, we offer students behavior support that is positive, research
-
based, and 
restorative in practice.  It is founded in th
e 3B's: Be Responsible, Be Respect and Be Safe.  We celebrate student achievement and progress.   
We have our Valle Vista Monthly Awards to acknowledge excellence and growth.  In addition, we have monthly BEST Incentives, w
here 
all students participate in 
a variety of fun and exciting activities.   We have a part
-
time counselor and a part
-
time family case manager to 
support our students and families.   The school also provides a complete physical education program.    Through attendance in
centives, 
both cla
ssroom and school
-
wide, we strive to promote positive student attendance.  We focus on making our school a positive learning 
environment in order to set the foundation for student achievement.
 
 
We are committed to developing lifelong learners who strive to
 
reach their personal best in a diverse and changing world.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Rep
ort Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountabi
lity Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC
.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the C
DE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Valle Vista is an open learning space school. Each pod is divided into five classroom spaces. In addition, there is a prescho
ol pod and a separate set of 
special day classrooms in four portable building units, each with two classrooms.  The open learning s
pace configuration provides a wonderful opportunity 
for differentiation of student learning and for teacher teaming and collaboration.   Each pod has access to mobile computer c
arts with Chromebooks or 
Apple iPads. The school is wired with wifi access poin
ts to allow for internet access.  The central heating and cooling systems maintain a comfortable 
environment. The campus grounds are expansive and have five separate play areas. Four cameras were installed in the school bu
ilding (office, library, 
cafeteria
, and A pod hall to monitor the lab) to increase safety.  Fencing, interior railing and interior, and exterior lighting contr
ibute to our safe 
environment. The students, staff, and parents are dedicated to maintaining a clean, safe, attractive and efficien
t learning environment. New playground 
structures were added in July 2011. With the passing of Measure L projected projects for Valle Vista done were repaving and s
triping of the front parking 
lot, repairing the roof, and new hardware throughout the school
 
for all the doors. The interior of the school was renovated during summer 2014.  In 
2017, new outdoor lighting was installed.  The inside lighting and flooring in the cafeteria were replaced in the summer of 2

opportunities are available for community and parental involvement at Valle Vista:
 
 
Supporting Reading: Being an excellent reader is the gateway to a successful future.  Each classroom teacher kindergarten and
 
firs
t grade, send home 
daily reading material at each student's reading level for practice at home. Students read the books to their parents and the
 
parents initial that their child 
has read to them.  Primary grades often take part in this reading at home prog
ram, where parents sign that their children have read the required number 
of minutes for their grade level at home nightly.  At school, the teacher, parent, or community volunteer listens to students
 
to reread their books again.  
It is noted whether the ch
ild read the book fluently or had difficulty with that level of a book.  In grades second through fifth, students may take ho
me 
library books and exchange them upon completion. Students work through levels of books with the goal of reading books fluentl
y a
t or above their grade
-
level standard.  Valle Vista encourages building reading comprehension through the daily reading at home.
 
 
Working with Students: In addition to listening to students read, parents work with students on projects, help students durin
g
 
grade level and site
-
wide 
special events, and prepare materials to support classroom learning.
 
 
D.E.A.R. Nights: Kindergarten through sixth grades also attend on a Drop Everything and Read (DEAR) night.  Parents, through 
PTA, provide theme 
decorations and refreshments for the event.
 
 
Movie Nights: Movie Nights are held three times per year on campus 
to bring the community together.
 
 
Friday Parent Academic Fair:  Valle Vista's parents are encouraged to join in this district community event. Parents are able
 
to choose a workshop that 
focuses on student achievement.
 
 
School Site Council: Parents, staff, 
and community are members of the School Site Council, who make budget decisions and assist in the composition of 
the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement.  All parents and community members are welcome to the meetings.
 
 
Family Case Manager: Provides support
 
to students and their families by providing access to community resources and programs that address issues 
related to medical care, mental health, individual or family counseling, truancy, housing, and other issues.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following info
rmation relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Valle Vista provides a safe and engaging learning environment. The district has a comprehensive Safe School Plan, adopted by 
the School Board, which 
contains goals for school safety and school climate.  There are standardized emergency procedures that all 
staff are to follow in the event of an 
emergency.  Emergency drills are held to ensure students know and can use safety procedures in case of a fire or earthquake. 
Lockdown drills, where 
students practice what to do in case of an intruder on campus, are he
ld to practice safety protocols. The staff goes through drills to practice and evaluate 
performance.  In addition, the district installed a 180
-
degree camera for safety. Fencing and gates limit the access of vehicles to the back areas of the 
school. Three 
cameras were installed in the front office, cafeteria, and library for added security. The facility is surveyed daily for any
 
safety concerns 
including graffiti.  Issues are promptly resolved. All visitors are required to enter the building through the fro
nt door, sign in and wear a visitors pass. No 
one can pick up a child unless their name is on the emergency card and the person shows a picture ID.
 
 
Valle Vista implements Positive Behavior Intervention Support (PBIS), the BEST Protocols (3B's), and Social
 
and Emotional Learning (SEL).  Monthly awards 
assemblies highlight and honor students who demonstrate the 3 B's: Be Safe, Be Respectful and Be Responsible. Our team of an 
administrator, along 
with select classroom teachers and classified staff, are on our
 
BEST Committee and attend meetings to plan for our school.  The BEST team also meets at 
the district level, to collaborate with other schools.

Our staff has worked together to define school
-
wide expectations
-
 
be respectful, be responsible and be 
safe.  Together we have agreed upon common 
language to use and have directly taught our students what these expectations are and what they look like for all areas of th
e school.   As a site, we hold 
BEST Incentives, where students can participate in a vari
ety of activities designed to encourage appropriate behavior. Our district continues to receive 
ongoing training in the Best Behavior Program, as well as SEL, to support a positive behavior program that provides intervent
ion techniques based on 
research.  
We seek to observe where incidents and implement strategies to appropriately address them.  We also have Student Success Team
 
meetings 
with the administrator, parent, and classroom teacher to plan and initiate individual student supports.  We have an after
-
school program to provide 
additional supervision and support for our students. The Mt. Pleasant After
-
school Program (MPAS) enrolls approximately 105 students. This program 
provides a homework center, intervention, enrichment activities, art and music, as
 
well as, sports programs.
