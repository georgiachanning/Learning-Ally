School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
As you read through our School Accountability Report Card for the year 2019
-
20, it will become evident that the 
Cottonwood community has a fine education program in place for their children. 
 
Our staff is dedicated to the 

children.
 
 
West Cottonwood continues to maintain a high quality academic program using highly qualifie
d teachers and the 
California State Teaching Standards. We are fortunate to have a School Board, Superintendent, and an administrative and 
teaching staff that is dedicated to promoting a positive image and to the improvement and success of all students.
 
 
W
est Cottonwood has establishment of a comprehensive elective program that allows our students to participate in a 
variety of activities such as Intro to Cooking, Choir, Art, Makerspace, and Intro to Agriculture. In addition, 8th grade 
students are also eli
gible to earn high school credit for a foreign language (Spanish 1), and may participate in our FFA 
program.
 
 
Cottonwood Union School District is located in Shasta County and encompasses 200 square miles along the Shasta
-
Tehama 
County Line. Cottonwood Unio
n School District is comprised of two schools, North Cottonwood Elementary School (K
-
4) 
and West Cottonwood Junior High School (5
-
8). The schools have consistently earn the reputation for high academic 
standards, extremely safe, well
-
disciplined campuses, 
and a school environment that is conducive to learning and parent 
participation.
 
 
Students at West Cottonwood Junior High School are guided by specific rules and classroom expectations that promote 
respect, communication, empowerment, and community. The sc
hool's discipline philosophy is based on a community
-
building approach to education, a partnership between students, parents, and the school, and a balance between support 
and accountability structures. Parents and students are informed of discipline polic
ies through the student handbook, and 
other forms of written communication such as newsletters, emails, and notifications home. The principal meets with all 
new students and parents before they attend class and communicates to them the high standards of st
udent behavior 
and the dress code. All staff members enforce the school rules in a fair and equitable manner and unacceptable behavior 
is quickly communicated to parents. A principal/counselor referral system in place to deal with serious and recurrent 
stu
dent management problems in a timely manner and in
-
house and/or at home suspension are used to handle aggressive 
student behavior.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: 
Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter
 
Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible st
udents may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The perc
entage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The School Site Safety Plan is reviewed and revised annually.  The Safety Plan is revised by the Safety Committee, which 
consists of the Superintendent, site administrators, clerical staff, and parents, and is approved by our School Site Council.

provided by teachers, paraprofessionals, and administrative staff to ensure the campuses are safe and w
ell supervised so 
all students can achieve social, academic, physical, and moral excellence.
