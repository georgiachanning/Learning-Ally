By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information
 
relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general e
ducation population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAA
s items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses th
at satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of the School Site Safety Plan is to provide a unified 
template for school sites to respond and recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the disruption of normal school operations.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan guides a coordinated school staff response to an emergency, disaster, or event and 
aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over time and those that may occur without warning.
 
 
The objectives of the S
chool Site Safety Plan are as follows:
 
1. Protect the safety and welfare of students, school staff, and visitors.
 
2. Provide for a safe and coordinated response to emergencies.
 

 
4. Enable the District to 
restore normal conditions with minimal confusion in the shortest time possible.
 
5. Provide for the interface and coordination between sites and the District Emergency Operations Center (DEOC).
 
6. Provide for the interface and coordination between the Distr
ict EOC and the Cities of Richmond, El Cerrito, San Pablo, 
Pinole, Hercules, and Contra Costa County Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
 
7. Provide for the orderly conversion of pre
-
designated District sites to mass care sites, when necessary.
 
 
The Comprehe
nsive School Safety Plan is updated annually.  Our school safety plan was last annually reviewed, updated, 
and discussed with school faculty and a student representative in January 2020.  A copy of the Comprehensive School 
Safety plan will be available for

The primary areas of focus for staff development are derived from district goals in accordance with student needs. The 
data used to determine the pertinent
 
 
needs of our student population include:
 

 
STAR and Fast Bridge Assessment for 
reading
 

 
English Language Arts district benchmarks
 

 
English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC)
 

 
My Math and IAB District Benchmarks
 

 
Ongoing common assessment data at each grade level
 
Wilson school goals include the following:
 

 
School wide 
commitment to continue the Instructional Support Model in which all students are being taught 
literacy skills in small groups.
 

 
School wide commitment to implement best practices around innovative project based learning strategies in 
ELA and math.
 

 
School 
wide commitment to use the Accelerated Reader program in every classroom as a means to improve 
reading skills for all students.
 

 
Within the scope of these goals, student progress and need will be consistently and continuously monitored 
through Data Driven I
nstruction (DDI) cycles.
 
Professional developments to address these goals include:
 

 
Ongoing professional development sessions that involve collective efforts to implement creative and innovative 
teaching and learning strategies.
 

 
Standards based professional
 
development.
 

 
Writer's Workshop Training (district and onsite).
 

 
Grade level planning days (onsite) .

Institute, Innovate Public School Fellowship, and Leadership Community of Practices in partnership with the 
Chamberlain Foundation.
 
Quality instruction and instructional leadership a
re at the heart of the district's achievement efforts. To ensure this, the 
Academic Support Division engages teachers, administrators and other personnel in ongoing professional development 
focused on improving teaching and learning. Training is provided t
o principals and other administrators to improve their 
ability to provide strong instructional leadership and guide teaching and learning at school sites. The principals, in turn, 
provide support to teachers through staff conferences, opportunities for col
laborative study and planning, and individual 
coaching based on ongoing classroom observations. Teachers and other staff are provided with both on and off
-
site 
professional development in all standards based curriculum content areas. Beyond the content are
as, professional 
development is provided in English Language Development, Gifted and Talented Education (GATE), differentiated 
instruction and educational technology. In addition, training is made available in classroom management and the effective 
use of 
assessment data and teacher data teams in meeting the needs of all students. A primary goal of the professional 
development program is ensuring that all students are served by skilled, highly qualified teachers and that teachers are 
supported by strong, kn
owledgeable instructional leaders.
