By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The mission of West Whittier Elementary is to cultivate a positive learning environment by collaboratively teaching a 
rigorous, enriched curriculum that educates and prepares all students to 
become life
-
 
long learners who are critical 
thinkers, problem solvers, and socially responsible citizens. West Whittier Elementary serves 389 students in grades TK
-
5. 
Our school community is comprised of 96% Hispanic with 86% participating in free and redu
ced lunch. 32% of our students 
are English Learners and 29% are Reclassified as Fluent
-
English Proficient. 
 
In addition, 20% of our population receives 
special education services. West Whittier has a 8.6% chronic absenteeism rate and a suspension rate of 1
.2%.
 
 
West Whittier Elementary provides a high quality instructional program to inspire and instill a love for learning in students
.  
Our staff consists of highly qualified teachers who are fully implementing the California State Standards for English 
Lang
uage Arts and Mathematics. All students have access to Common Core aligned instructional materials.  Teachers are 
continuously improving their craft of teaching through collaboration and ongoing professional development offered by 
the district and school s
ite. Our teachers regularly collaborate to share effective strategies, analyze student work, and plan 

-
level teams do discuss assessment 
results and create plans for effectively responding to students' needs and improving 
student achievement.
 
 
West Whittier Elementary utilizes a multi
-
tiered system of support to close the achievement gap and support higher levels 
of learning. Students are p
rovided varying levels of interventions based on needs. 
 
A variety of data is used to determine 
which students are in need of interventions. Universal screening assessments are administered in the first few weeks of 

eading skills. 
 
Based on this information, students are strategically placed in 
reading groups based on common needs.  All students receive reading intervention or reading enrichment 4 times a week 
for 35 minutes a day.  Students who are in need of our mos
t intensive support are placed in small groups of up to 6 
students. 
  
The progress of all students is monitored throughout the year and adjustments to groups and interventions are 
made based on needs.
 
 
West Whittier Elementary strives for the academic and 
social success of all students by providing a safe and respectful 
environment where students take responsibility for their learning and behavior. Positive Behavior Interventions and 
Supports (P.B.I.S.) is a framework utilized to create positive and support
ive learning environments that foster academic 
and social success. West Whittier is focused on prevention of misbehavior by defining and explicitly teaching positive 
social expectations.  Our behavior matrix establishes school
-
wide expectations in all area
s and supports students 
demonstrating P.A.W. expectations by Practicing responsibility, Always being respectful, and Working and playing safely. 
We believe these core values are essential to school success as well as being a good citizen.  We are dedicated
 
to helping 
all students be successful in school and in life.  We provide regular feedback to students to help positively shape their 
behaviors.  All adults acknowledge positive behaviors throughout the day and misbehaviors are discussed and retaught.  
In 
addition, our P.B.I.S. Leadership team meets regularly to analyze behavior data and use it for decision
-
making.

Technology is used in meaningful ways to support teaching and learning.  It is thoughtfully integrated into our curriculum 
to support problem s
olving, decision
-
making, collaboration, and innovation.  We are incredibly fortunate that every 
student has access to 1:1 iPad technology throughout the day.  All classrooms are equipped with voice amplifiers, 
instructional monitors, and document cameras t
o support instruction and learning. Teachers use technology to promote 

learning modalities in the classroom.  Technology is also used to s
howcase student learning. Through the use of 
technology, students are able to demonstrate creativity and problem
-
solving skills by displaying their understanding in 
meaningful ways.

to our decision to purchase instructional 
materials aligned with the State Standards. Currently, all teachers in grades K
-
8 have access to math curriculum that 
supports teaching the CA Common Core Math Standards.  Elementary grades use Eureka Math curricu
lum, which includes 


 
Reading and Writing Units of Study to support reading and writing instruction for all teachers in grades K
-
8. The Reading 
and Writing Units of Study are aligned to the standrads and were designed to match the rigor of the new CA Reading and 
Writing Common
 
Core Standards. The District also purchased classroom libraries for each grade level to support the 
diverse reading abilities in each classroom. Curriculum was purchased to ensure students acquire the foundational reading 
skills needed for early literacy 
skills. Phonics, Spelling, & Word Study System by Fountas & Pinnell was purchased for grades 
K
-
3 to help students attend to, learn about, and efficiently use sounds, letters, and words. In addition, Classroom Shared 
Reading materials by Fountas & Pinnell w
ere purchased for grades K
-
2 to help build a strong early reading foundation. A 
process is in place for schools to order materials at the beginning of each school year for all students. In addition, there 
is 
a process to order additional materials througho
ut the year to address the changing needs of a schools student population, 

classes so appropriate materials can be ordered.  Our schoo
l complies with the Williams Law; every child has an 
appropriate textbook for all academic subjects requiring textbooks. Students are allowed to take textbooks home  to study 
after school when needed. The school uses district and categorical funds to provi
de supplemental materials for classrooms 
including classroom library books, as well as materials for intervention and ELD. Finally, WCSD has an established a 
thorough process for examining new instructional materials as they become available. With the full
 
implementation of 
the California State Standards, the District will use the process to examine, explore, pilot and adopt new curriculum 
materials aligned with the CCSS, with input and feedback from teachers, administrators and parents. Based on the 
recomm

to ensure that the most appropriate materials are identified for our students.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Secure Campus: 
West Whittier strives to create a safe and healthy environment for our staff members, students, and 
visitors.  Therefore all volunteers and visitors on campus are required to enter through the office.  This ensures that every
 
adult on campus is identified 

send parents to the office if they do not have a pass. Once school begins, all exterior gates are locked. Access to the schoo
l 
is through the main office.
 
 
Safe D

-
off and Pick
-
up System was 
established to promote safety. Students being dropped off and picked up by car will utilize our valet system to ensure 
students arrive and 
depart from school safely.
 
 
The staff at West Whittier strives to maintain a safe and orderly environment for our students. Staff members are assigned 
supervision duties before and after school, during recesses, and during lunch. Drills for fires, earthqua
kes, and lock downs 
are held throughout the year so that students and staff can practice these safety routines.  Each staff member is assigned 
a specific task in the event of an earthquake.  The site custodian checks the school grounds and equipment for sa
fety 
issues on a daily basis. The goal is to ensure that all of the school facilities are safe and clean for the students and staf
f. 
We are in accordance with the grounds expectations of the William's Law. Parent cooperation and involvement is essential 
in
 
helping the school maintain a safe learning environment for all children. Staff meetings are used to review the safety 
plan, teacher handbook, school policies, and rules.  Parents are asked to also provided with the school rules and policies 
and are requi
red to sign acknowledging that they have received and reviewed them.
 
 
The safety plan was reviewed, updated and discussed with the faculty at the Opening Staff Meeting in August.  We 
continuously revisit and update our school plan as we practice our drills
 
throughout the year.
 
 
Finally, a strong partnership exists between our school and local law enforcement. Local law enforcement agencies provide 
ongoing support to the school and coordinates with school and district personnel to ensure students safety in case of a 
campus or neig
hborhood threat.
