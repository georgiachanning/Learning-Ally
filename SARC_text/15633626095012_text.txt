By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg

.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Castle School, located in Southwest Bakersfield, is one of 24 schools in the Panama Buena Vista Union School District.  
Castle is a neighborhood school with most childre
n living within walking distance of the school.  Students at Castle receive 
a wide range of programs and services.  In the 2018/19 school year, about 85% percent of our students were on free or 
reduced price meals.
 
 
With 1 Principal and an Assistant Princi
pal, 29 regular classroom teachers, 6 STEAM Specialists, two special education 
teachers, three academic coaches, a full time counselor, a psychologist, a speech therapist, and two reading specialists, 
students are learning and needs are supported in a vari
ety of learning environments.
 
 
Parents provide support to Castle in many capacities. The School Accountability Report Card (SARC), which is required by 
law to be published annually, contains information about the condition and performance of each Californi
a public school. 
More information about SARC requirements is available at the California Department of Education (CDE) Web site at 
http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/. For additional information about the school, parents and community members should 
contact th
e school principal or the District Office. DataQuest, an online data tool at http://data1.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/, 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the District, the county, and the state.
 
 
Throughout its yea
rs, Castle Elementary School has been one of the largest schools in the District. Named to honor a 
dedicated educational leader and respected principal, Charles H. Castle School is nestled in a quiet southwest Bakersfield 
neighborhood on the corner of Wils
on Road and Edgemont Drive.  After service in the Air Force, Mr. Castle settled into a 
rewarding career as a public educator.  At Panama and Seibert Elementary Schools he inspired the respect of staff, 
students, and families for his high expectations for a
cademic performance and citizenship.  Opening its doors in January 

 
 
Castle School receives funds from LCAP, Title I and Federal SIG funds from the federal government. The Title I funds serve 
to improve our Language Arts program and support intervention practices in grades kindergarten through sixth.  Our funds 
are also used to improve the core program, provide professional development, assist identified English Language Learners, 
increase acce
ss to technology and improve instruction in ELA and Math. The SIG funds have been used to transform Castle 
into a STEAM Academy, funding additional staff, STEAM labs, and unique learning experiences.
 
 
Our school purpose, "Breaking Barriers, 
Building Futures" drives our daily work. We strive to use high leverage strategies 
and best practices to overcome the barriers students face and create new possibilities for their future.  Our goal is to 

Panama
-
Buena Vista Union School District.  Dedication, hard work, 
and a commitment to solid academic teaching practices have led our professional educators to support children in a safe, 
nurturing, and academically focused learning environment.
 
 
Castle 
strives to increase achievement in reading, math and EL Re
-
designation rates. Additionally, we also strive to provide 
integrated learning experiences that build 21st Century Learning Skills.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Castle provides a safe and clean environment for learning. A scheduled maintenance program is administ
ered by the 
District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are maintained to a degree of adequacy that provides for a safe learnin
g 
environment. Ongoing repairs and modifications to the physical plant exceed California Building and Safety Codes. The
 

grounds are well lit and the perimeter of the school facility is fenced for student protection and safety. A team of 
custodians ensures cl
assrooms and campus grounds are kept clean and safe. The restrooms are cleaned, sanitized and 
secured at the end of each school day with 100% of the toilets in operating condition. As outlined in our Safe Schools Plan, 
the safety committee has addressed co
ncerns for the safe coming and going of our students. Staff receive inservice in 
emergency protocols and CPR. Identifying tags are issued to substitute teachers, volunteers, and other visitors as they 
register in our office. The gates on the perimeter of t
he school playground are locked during school hours and staff 
members are trained to activate lock down procedures in the event of an emergency. Our positive partnership with local 
law enforcement is evident in their quick response time when concerns arise
. Designated staff members carefully 
supervise students on the playground and in the cafeteria. Grounds and playground equipment are inspected regularly 
for potential hazards. The District provides on
-
going training in CPR/First Aid as part of its staff de
velopment program. Fire 
and/or disaster drills occur monthly and a complete school site disaster plan has been prepared and is in place and 
available for public review. Scheduled certificated supervision of students begins officially at 7:20 a.m. when the 
school 
opens and supervision ends at 2:45 p.m.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: 
Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter
 
Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible st
udents may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The perc
entage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

provide students with opportunities to learn self
-
discipline through a system of clear expectations, consistent rewards and 
conseque
nces for their behavior.  Castle Elementary believes students who develop a sense of personal responsibility will 
mature both academically and emotionally.  Parents and students are informed of discipline policies at the beginning of 
each school year throu
gh classroom orientation as well as individual parent
-
student handbooks.  Castle also provides 
social emotional support for students. The school counselor conducts social skills groups and conducts check in
-
check out 
to foster positive behavior.
 
 
Castle ha
s a Comprehensive Safe School Plan which was developed with the support of the School Site Council.  The safety 
plan was reviewed and updated by the School Site Council on October 29, 2019.  It was also discussed and reviewed with 
the staff in August 2019.
  
The plan covers positive discipline, incentive programs and safe school practices. Castle has 
implemented routines for arriving to campus and dismissal to maintain safety. Additionally, drills are conducted monthly 
to teach students how to properly respo
nd to an emergency. Castle is a "closed campus," meaning all visitors must provide 
identification and sign in to be allowed on campus.
 
 
Students with excessive tardies, truancies or unexcused absences are subject to mandatory parent conferences with the 
si

Program for students who must be absent from school due to illness for an extended period of time.  Castle establishes 
guidelines to 
provide students with a meaningful, productive, and enjoyable school experience.  Appropriate behavior is 
encouraged through praise and motivational incentives as well as assertive discipline and conflict resolution tools to 
further develop personal growth
.  Expulsions occur only when required by law or when all other alternatives are 
exhausted.
