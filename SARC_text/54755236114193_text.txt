solving, and reflective dialogue that enables them to examine their 
practices with the ultimate goal of improving student achievement. Furthermore, the staff at 
Monte Vista understands
 
the importance of helping students realize their full potential as not only 
students but as citizens in a dynamic and ever changing world. Thus, we are dedicated to create a 
college

ning and 
education.
 
 

problem solving, and developing the skills needed to adapt to the demands of a rapidly changing 
world.WE have emphasized the achieve
ment of every student in every classroom. This approach 
makes sure that poor performance is not acceptable and each and every adult is accountable to 
the students that sit in front of them every day. By placing relentless focus on individual 
performance, w
e have implemented a vital cycle of instruction, assessment, and intervention, 
followed by more instruction, assessment, and intervention. We believe in all our students and will 
do whatever it takes to make them successful. The students have developed an 
attitude of "I can 
and I will" when it comes to their academic success.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Califo
rnia is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational ag
encies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data re
ported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.g
ov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System
, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and gr
ade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive
 
disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Monte Vista Elementary School. Yard supervisors, teachers, and admin
istrators supervise students 
on campus before and after school and du
ring recess, while noon duty supervisors monitor students during the lunch break. All visitors must report to 
the office and receive proper authorization to be on campus. For the safety of our students, all volunteers are fingerprinted
 
and cleared through 
the 
Department of Justice. Appointments are made with the school secretary. Visitors are asked by the staff to display their pass
 
at all times. The school also 
coordinates with a School Resource Officer who provides support and resources to the school, stu
dents, parents, and the community in dealing with 
issues such as cyber
-
bullying.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan review was initiated in the 2014
-
15 school year by the Safety Committee. The plan is reviewed yearly Fall of the 2019
-
20 
school year with a goal t
hat all students are supervised at all times. Other key elements of the plan focus on emergency preparedness. The school is i
n 
compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. Emergency 
dril
ls are held on a regular 
basis; fire drills are held once a month while earthquake and secure campus drills are each held once a year.
