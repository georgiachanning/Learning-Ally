School Description
 
H
illtop Drive School is one of 49 schools in the Chula Vista Elementary School District, including 
charters. The school was built in 1943. The entire school was modernized in the summer of 2015 
thanks to voter approval of Proposition E.  In addition to bea
utification and improvements in 
infrastructure, the school now meets American with Disability Act (ADA) standards.  All classrooms 
have access to wireless internet; each classroom has a smart TV.  The office building was redesigned 
to create a front office
 
hallway for ingress and egress. Office building bathrooms were redesigned.  
Parents no longer enter campus through the Attendance/Health Office.  The physical plant consists 
of an office building with two classrooms, a cafeteria/auditorium building, and f
our finger
-
like 
wings containing classrooms and a library/media center.  There are three additional classrooms 
east of the auditorium. The library is well
-
stocked with books and materials for all students in 
grades K
-
6.  The media center has thirty compute
rs for student use before, during, and after school. 
School buildings and classrooms are clean, well
-
maintained and attractive, free of physical hazards, 
and designed to prevent criminal activity.  Classrooms have sufficient space for students and 
teacher.
  
Teachers provide safe, supportive learning environments for their students.  Classrooms 
are evaluated annually using a Hilltop Physical Environment rubric. Students have access to current 
state
-
adopted textbooks and other materials.  Classroom rules and 
consequences are posted and 
reviewed regularly with students.  Classroom interruptions and disruptions are minimized in order 
to maximize instructional time.  Messages are delivered to staff members through staff mailboxes, 
voice mail, and e
-
mail.  Each cl
assroom has a telephone for communication with the office, parents, 
and in case of emergency. The school also has a school
-
wide intercom system. Two
-
way radios are 
available for office staff, noon duty workers, Special Day Class teachers, and each grade le
vel team 
lead, as well as campus Resource Teacher.
 
 
Hilltop has an expansive playground area with a large grass soccer field, two baseball backstops, 
and a large asphalt area surrounded by shrubs and trees.  There are two play structures, 
basketball 
courts, a ball wall, tetherball poles, four
-
square, hopscotch, and other games.  Plenty of playground 
balls are available.  Garden boxes have been installed in a gated garden area at the southwest 
corner of the school. Hilltop Drive is an import
ant part of the community.  After
-
school, evening, 
and weekend use of school facilities by community groups and organizations is encouraged.  The 
STRETCH (Safe Time for Recreation and Tutoring for Children) after school program, co
-
funded by 
the District a
nd YMCA, provides safe, supervised after school recreation and tutoring at no cost to 
families until 6:00 each night.  In July 2013, a Child Development Associates (CDA) preschool was 
constructed at the south end of the Hilltop campus. The preschool is an 
attractive facility that 
blends well with the existing structures. Though housed on our premises, the Hilltop CDA preschool 
is not owned or run by the District.
 
 
Students, parents and staff value the diversity and cultural richness of our school and commun
ity. 
We currently have 535 students, 16 of whom are in our Primary and Upper Grade Special Day 
Classes.  Our student population included Hispanic or Latino (84%), White (10%), African
-
American 
(1%), Filipino (1%), and two or more ethnicity (3%). Twenty
-
eig
ht percent of Hilltop students are 
English Language Learners. The mobility rate was 11%, for the 17
-
18 academic year. The ADA for 
17
-
18 academic year was 96.1%. At Hilltop Drive School, every student, staff member, and parent 
is valued as an individual of 
great worth. Staff members, students, and parents are all important 
members of the school family.  The Hilltop Drive School staff sets and maintains high expectations 
for student academic achievement and behavior.  The staff believes that all students can 
learn and 
shares responsibility for student well
-
being and success.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The S
ARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), whic
h describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more informati
on about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The school was built in 1947 and has a long established
 
history of community support. The administration building houses the front office, health room, 
Principal's office, collaboration room, work room, staff lounge, and two classrooms. Five separate wings each house four to f
ive self
-
contained 
classrooms. Two
 
classrooms are used as a library/media center. Three additional classrooms have been added next to the cafeteria. Our 
cafeteria/auditorium is used as a multipurpose room, and houses a before and after school YMCA day
-
care as well as an after school STRETC
H program. 
Student safety and well
-
being are promoted through emergency and earthquake preparedness drills, bus evacuation drills, playground supervision, drug 
and alcohol abuse prevention education programs, a KIDCO program, the School Safety Patrol, and 
a No Place for Hate partnership.
 
 
A large playground area includes blacktop games, two play structures, an expansive soccer field, and two kickball fields.
 
 
The District maintains a planned program, which ensures routine maintenance functions are performed
 
on a scheduled basis.  Hilltop custodial staff 
performs basic cleaning operations daily. Restrooms and classrooms are cleaned on a daily basis and maintenance is performed 
during school breaks.
 
 
School Site Council has agreed that the doors to student res
trooms should remain open during school hours.  This is conducive to student safety, 
appropriate behavior, and maintaining restroom cleanliness.
 
 
In July, 2013, a Preschool facility was added to the Southwest area of the Hilltop grounds.  A chain link fenc
e separates the Preschool from the Hilltop 
Elementary campus.

havioral expectations. 

š school. Expectations and proced
ures are taught at the beginning of each year and frequently reviewed. School rules 
and procedures are included in Staff and Parent Handbooks. Behavioral expectations are also shared through the weekly school
-
to
-
home communication, 
FYI. Home communication 
is translated into Spanish whenever possible. The bilingual School Secretary enhances communication with our Spanish
-
speaking community. Behavioral expectations are enforced fairly and consistently. Staff members use a problem solving process
 
to deal with 
student 
behavior issues. Progressive consequences are assigned. Parents are notified about behavior issues through discipline referra
ls or phone calls home. 
Appropriate documentation is maintained. Classroom conditions provide a safe, orderly learning envi
ronment and promote positive interactions between 
and among staff members and students. Classroom rules and consequences are posted and reviewed regularly with students. Class
room teachers and 
support personnel provide playground supervision. Student safet
y is the first priority of playground supervisors. Supervisors are instructed on the Hilltop 
Knights Code of Honor, the safe and proper use of playground equipment, and a standard problem
-
solving protocol. Two classroom teachers supervise 
each morning rece
ss. A full
-
time KIDCO staff member provides social skills support to primary classes, small groups, and individual students in need. The
 
STRETCH program (Safe Time for Recreation and Tutoring for Children) provides safe, supervised after
-
school recreation 
and tutoring until 6:00 p.m. each 
day. Student safety and well
-
being are also promoted through emergency and earthquake preparedness drills, bus evacuation drills, drug and alcohol 
abuse prevention education, and the School Safety Patrol. Our School Safety
 
Plan is revised each year and reviewed with our staff during the year.  The 
School Safety Plan was most recently reviewed and revised in the Fall of 2019.  It is a living plan that we continuously revi
sit. Fire drills, earthquake/disaster 
drills, lock
-
dow
n drills are held on a regular basis to ensure that all staff members and students practice steps to take in case of emergenc
y.
