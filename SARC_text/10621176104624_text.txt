The School Accountability Report Card (SARC) was established by Proposition 98, an initiative 
passed by California voters in November 1988. The SARC, which is issued annually by local school 
boards for each 
public elementary and secondary school in the state, provides parents and other 
interested people with a variety of information about the school, its resources, its successes and 
the areas in which improvements are needed. It is important to note this docu
ment represents the 
2018
-
19 school year. 
 
 
As you read this SARC for Mountain View Elementary School, I believe you will find what emerges 
is a picture of a school with a commitment to excellence and sustained improvement; a faculty that 
is professionally 
skilled and personally committed to meeting the learning needs of all students; an 
involved, visible and supportive community; and a student body which is motivated to perform. 
Mountain View sets high standards of excellence for its staff and students. Thi
s year, we have set 
the following goals: maximizing student achievement in all curricular areas with an emphasis on 
mathematics with the school wide use of Ready and iReady Mathematics; implementation of the 

o Intervention (RTI)/Multi
-
Tiered Systems of 
Support (MTSS) focusing on Tier II & Tier III intervention, ensuring a safe environment with a focus 
on character education development and Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS); 
and providing co
-
curricular activities to enhance the overall educational program at Mountain 
View. We are pleased to report Mountain View was recognized for both the California Business for 
Excellence in Education Award and the Positive Behavior Intervention and Support 
Gold Level 
Award. 
 
 
Sincerely,
 
 
Monica Everson
 
 
Principal
 
 
 
School Mission Statement

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Built in 1989, Mountain View Elementary is 30 years old. Our campus has six portable classrooms, 25 permanent classrooms, one
 
multipurpose room, 
one library with a computer lab, one snack bar and equip
ment room, one football field, and three baseball diamonds. We take pride in providing a clean, 
safe learning environment. Our custodians (one full
-
time plant supervisor, one full
-
time night custodian and one part
-
time evening custodian) perform 
basic clea
ning operations daily and maintain the grounds and buildings. In addition, deep cleaning is conducted two times a year at eac
h site. Our school 
conducts eight clean
-
campus inspections each year. Volunteering parents inspect the campus grounds and restrooms
 
on a regular basis to provide 
feedback to our student body. When asked on the 2018

providing a quality education that promotes academic success. Graffiti is removed immediately. Through increased community aw
areness, pride and an 
open
-
campus policy, we hope to keep 
vandalism and burglary to an all
-
time low.
 
 
The district believes schools are the hub of their neighborhoods. As a result, a high priority is placed on building and main
 
training excellent facilities as 
economically as possible.
 
 
A facility audit was condu
cted in 2008
-
09 with input from the site administrator and plant supervisor. As a result, it was determined Mountain View was 
in need of a new HVAC system. During the summer of 2012, Mountain View received new air conditioning and heating unit ventila
tors 
along with updated 
lighting fixtures for each classroom. Additional improvements included improved drainage in the amphitheater and drainage in 
the baseball dugout. In 
the spring of 2013, the school received new solar panels in both the parking lot and on 
the playground.  In 2016, every building on the Mountain View 
campus was repainted and classroom were updated with new ceiling projectors.

State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical

Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Moun
tain View has both a school safety plan and School Crisis Intervention Plan on file, and both are available to all parents as
 
well as the general public. 
The school safety plan is reviewed and updated annually and discussed with staff throughout the year. 
Most recently, the complete plan was updated in 
January 2020. In our weekly newsletter, The Growl, parents are provided with school safety information in the event of potent
ial school emergencies. 
The school
-
safety committee develops the plan with input fr
om parents and community members. Specific areas of focus, coupled with appropriate 
strategies to address concerns are featured in our school plan.  The school crisis intervention plans provides step by step p
rocedures in the event of fires, 
campus lock do
wns, earthquakes, and evacuations. The campus is supervised 20 minutes before school and 15 minutes after school by certifica
ted staff 
and administration.   During each of the three lunch recesses, supervision is provided by four hired campus monitors. Dur
ing rainy weather and/or bad 
air quality days, all students arriving to school are supervised in the multipurpose room to wait for their teacher.

Types of Services Funded
 

 
On an annual basis, Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) submits the Application for Funding Consolidated Application and Re
porting System for 
Categorical Aid Programs commonly called CARS. The application is submitted in two (2) parts:  Part I, which con
tains program and demographic 
information, is submitted by June 1 each year; and Part II, which contains the budget information and additional program data
, is submitted by January 
31 each year.  The categorical programs included in the application are Tit
le I, Part A 

 
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged 
Improving, Title I, Part C 

 
Migrant Education, Title II, Part A 

 
Preparing, Training and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals, and Title III 

 
Language Instruction for Limi
ted English Proficient and Immigrant Students.  Essentially, these funds are designed to assist students in mastering state 
standards.
 
 
Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community
.  CUSD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive differences in the lives of the children we all support.  We know from research tha

education will not only bring success to your child but other children 
in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending
 
on the type of categorical 
funding a site may re
ceive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and guidelines.  Such adviso
ry 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee 
(DAC) and School Advisory Committee (SAC)

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each and every s
tudent.  Parental involvement is a necessary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall program.  At the district level, parent committees provide input into each of the 

Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP)

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://
www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
t
s, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
S
chool Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.
 
 
District Advisory Committ
ee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves as an advisory committee
 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. 
They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs are supplemental education opportunit
ies that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  Th
e SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are 
required to form an ELAC. The ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding ser
vices for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two 
years.

District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall 
be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a
 
DELAC representative and arrange to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/gu
ardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student
) currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) elected to serve as the DELAC 

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee me
ets four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achievement of our students, comm
unity agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alask
an Native students in grades K 
-

assists eligible students to achieve at the same challenging state performance standards expected of all students in grades p

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP
 
annually that works to better align the academic plan with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to 
participate in the 
development of the LCAP through partici
pation of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, District Meetings and 
Community Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share 
their ideas on how CUSD 
can provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in the forums 


 
 
These forums are designed to provide an opportun

provide input and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to sha
re new ideas to support 
identi
fied groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical funding and programs in CUSD.  These funds are further discussed and outlined
 

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 
G

stics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from econom
ically disadvantaged homes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they have a primary language other than English.  Ch
ildren, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not general
ly provided through the base/core curriculum program.  The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Catego
rical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support
 
to meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of high quality
 
learning opportunities and access to the core curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additional assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom pro
gram (base/core curriculum) 
and address any learning ga
ps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff development.   Staff developme
nt 
activities are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other staff to 
cha
llenge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
 
 
Categorical Program Descriptions
