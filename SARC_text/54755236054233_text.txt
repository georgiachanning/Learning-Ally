About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability 
Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the S
ARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more informatio
n about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school prin
cipal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Belleview Elementary School was originally constructed in the early 1920's and has since undergone complete modernization. In
 
the summer of 2009, 
the cafeteria and students
 
restrooms were remodeled, and the covered walkways were built for hallways. A new two
-
story building containing 11 new 
classrooms was completed Spring 2016. The campus is currently comprised of 17 classrooms total,  a library/resource room, a c
afeteria, t
wo playgrounds 
(a kindergarten playground and a main yard), and the main office which includes a staff room.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
The school provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district governing board has adopte
d cl
eaning standards for all 
schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the school year with emphasis on
 
classrooms and restrooms. 
A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litte
r
-
free. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop 
sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair
 

 
on a regular basis, with heavy maintenance functions occurring during 
vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that school grounds
 
and facilities remain in 
excellent repair. A work order pro
cess is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority; repair 
requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received.

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education populati
on and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Belleview Elementary School. Our campus is fully enclosed by a fence
 
with locked gates. Belleview 
staff su
pervise students on campus before school, after school, and during morning recess and at lunchtime. As part of our PBIS struc
tures, students are 
also supervised during transition periods throughout the day. Administrators provide ongoing supervision of stu
dents throughout the campus. Staff wear 
a neon green PUSD Safety Patrol vest for easy identification and location. PUSD employees wear their district identification 
badge at all times. For the 
safety of our students, all volunteers are fingerprinted and cl
eared through the Department of Justice. Appointments are made with the school secretary. 
Additionally, Belleview uses the Raptor School Safety System which requires visitors on campus to present identification and 
be screened through the 
Raptor system in 
the front office prior to entering campus. Instant visitor identification badges are printed with the visitor's photo, and da
te and time of 
the visit. The Raptor School Safety System also provides a silent alarm to law enforcement in case of emergencies.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan is in a noted binder on the wall by the door in each room on campus. Key elements of the plan foc
us on emergency 
preparedness. The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials a
nd state earthquake standards. 
Emergency drills are held on a regular basis; fire drills, earthquake drills, and secure campus drills. Our school safety pla
n is reviewed yearly, this year
