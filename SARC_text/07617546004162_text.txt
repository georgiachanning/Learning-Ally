Mission
 
Statement:
 
The
 
mission
 
of
 
Monte
 
Gardens
 
Elementary
 
School
 
is
 
to
 
foster
 
knowledgeable,
 
inquiry-driven
 
citizens
 
who
 
are
 
open-minded
 
and
 
compassionate.
 
We
 
are
 
a
 
collaborative
 
community
 
with
 
high
 
academic
 
and
 
behavioral
 
expectations
 
where
 
we
 
work
 
together
 
to
 
empower
 
students
 
to
 
be
 
global
 
life-long
 
learners.
 
 
The
 
teamwork
 
and
 
support
 
of
 
our
 
parent
 
community
 
are
 
what
 
sets
 
us
 
apart
 
from
 
all
 
other
 
schoosl.
 
From
 
our
 
beautifully
 
maintained
 
grounds
 
to
 
the
 
small
 
group
 
instruction
 
in
 
the
 
classroom,
 
parents
 
help
 
support
 
all
 
aspects
 
of
 
the
 
academic
 
program
 
at
 
Monte
 
Gardens.
 
 
As
 
the
 
principal,
 
I
 
will
 
continue
 
to
 
engage
 
with
 
all
 
our
 
stakeholders
 
through
 
open
 
dialogue
 
and
 
being
 
responsive
 
to
 
communications
 
with
 
my
 
office.
 
Providing
 
a
 
learning
 
environment
 
that
 
is
 
safe,
 
orderly,
 
and
 
has
 
high
 
expectations
 
both
 
socially
 
and
 
academically
 
for
 
our
 
children
 
is
 
the
 
focus
 
of
 
all
 
who
 
work
 
at
 
Monte
 
Gardens
 
Elementary.
 
We
 
look
 
forward
 
to
 
working
 
together
 
to
 
support
 
the
 
continued
 
success
 
of
 
our
 
students.

Parent
 
Leadership
 
and
 
Parent
 
Volunteers
 
Parent
 
volunteers
 
are
 
an
 
essential
 
and
 
valued
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
program
 
at
 
Monte
 
Gardens.
 
The
 
Diablo
 
Basics
 
Parents™
 
Club
 
(DBPC),
 
the
 
principal,
 
and
 
teachers
 
rely
 
on
 
the
 
generous
 
support
 
of
 
parents
 
to
 
provide
 
classroom
 
support,
 
to
 
help
 
with
 
community
 
events,
 
to
 
participate
 
in
 
fundraising,
 
and
 
to
 
serve
 
on
 
school
 
committees.
 
It
 
is
 
this
 
support
 
that
 
distinguishes
 
Monte
 
Gardens
 
Elementary
 
as
 
a
 
school
 
of
 
choice.
 
 
Parent
 
support
 
begins
 
at
 
home,
 
where
 
parents
 
oversee
 
homework
 
and
 
provide
 
opportunities
 
for
 
students
 
to
 
be
 
academically
 
and
 
socially
 
successful.
 
Parents
 
are
 
actively
 
involved
 
in
 
all
 
facets
 
of
 
their
 
child™s
 
education,
 
from
 
the
 
signing
 
of
 
the
 
parental
 
agreement
 
of
 
support
 
to
 
on
 
or
 
off-site
 
volunteerism.
 
On-site
 
volunteerism
 
may
 
include
 
helping
 
in
 
the
 
classroom,
 
library
 
or
 
computer
 
lab,
 
working
 
on
 
a
 
special
 
project,
 
chaperoning
 
students,
 
participation
 
in
 
a
 
Parents™
 
Club
 
event,
 
or
 
school-wide
 
designated
 
programs
 
or
 
activities.
 
All
 
volunteers
 
must
 
be
 
fingerprinted
 
and
 
have
 
TB
 
clearance.
 
 
Monte
 
Gardens
 
expects
 
each
 
family
 
to
 
commit
 
to
 
a
 
minimum
 
of
 
20
 
hours
 
of
 
volunteer
 
service
 
each
 
school
 
year,
 
the
 
equivalent
 
of
 
2
 
hours
 
per
 
month.
 
There
 
are
 
many
 
ways
 
that
 
these
 
hours
 
can
 
be
 
fulfilled
 
and
 
are
 
flexible
 
to
 
accommodate
 
families
 
with
 
one
 
working
 
parent
 
or
 
two.
 
Volunteer
 
hours
 
are
 
self-reported
 
and
 
we
 
recognize
 
and
 
celebrate
 
volunteer
 
contributions.
 
While
 
20
 
hours
 
is
 
the
 
minimum,
 
Monte
 
Gardens
 
recognizes
 
families
 
who
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
do
 
more
 
through
 
a
 
series
 
of
 
appreciation
 
levels.
 
Volunteers
 
are
 
honored
 
for
 
their
 
generous
 
support
 
at
 
our
 
annual
 
Appreciation
 
Tea.

is
 
an
 
important
 
way
 
to

representative
 
meet
 
with
 
the
 
Executive
 
Board
 
and
 
attend
 
the
 
general

monthly.
 
We
 
are
 
pleased
 
to
 
have
 
an
 
enthusiastic
 
group
 
of
 
parents
 
and
 
staff
 
serving
 
on
 
the
 
DBPC
 
Board
 
and
