By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Safety is a high priority at Susan B. Anthony. Susan B. Anthony follows the San Mateo County Office of Education safety 
protocol (Immediate Action Emergency Response for Schools).  We have monthly drills in:  Shelter in Place, Drop, Cover, 
and Hold On, Sec
ure Campus, Lockdown / Barricade, and Evacuation.  The Daly City Fire Department conducts school 
assemblies every October to educate students about fire safety. A safety plan is updated and reviewed annually and a 
copy is located in every classroom as well
 
as the front office.
 
 
Disaster Preparation: There is a district wide Disaster Preparedness Facilitator who oversees the Disaster Preparedness 
Plan for our district. There is an ongoing program of chemical substance supervision that is consistent with stat
e law and 
directed by the Director of Maintenance. The district maintains disaster supplies and equipment at our school. The 
supplies include food and water for 3 days for all students and staff, blankets, flashlights, communication devices and 
other impor
tant supplies.

Susan B. Anthony School is committed to maintaining a safe environment for student, staff and volunteers. We believe 
that good discipline is essential to providing a positive learning environment for students. Students and parents are 
infor
med about discipline policies at the beginning of the school year through notices, assemblies and Back
-
to
-
School 
Night. All students receive a Code of Conduct booklet that outlines the discipline policy and procedures that apply district 
wide. We have also
 
adopted a set of rules for student behavior that applies specifically to our school. The district maintains 
a "zero tolerance" policy regarding violent actions at school. Also, state law requires mandatory expulsion for many serious 
offenses. Susan B. Ant
hony has a conflict resolution program in place and students are trained annually. Students are 
taught to express their feelings and to use words instead of physical action to solve conflicts. Susan B. Anthony School also
 
provides a safe environment by hav
ing sufficient supervision at recess and lunch. Teachers, physical education aides and 
the principal supervise students on the playground. Students are also carefully monitored at all times during the day and 
must have permission from the teacher to leave 
the classroom. All visitors are required to register at the office before 
being allowed on campus.
