School Description
 
EastLake
 
Elementary School is one of 49 schools in the Chula Vista Elementary School District, 
including charters. The school is located in the EastLake community of Chula Vista, and serves the 
neighborhoods of EastLake Hills and EastLake Shores. In addition, our 
site receives students from 
the surrounding EastLake and Otay Ranch neighborhoods. A large parking area and landscaped 
grounds greet visitors, staff and students. Each of the five buildings has four classrooms, a 
workroom, and office/study rooms. In additi
on, there are 11 portable classrooms.
 
 
EastLake Elementary School has a strong sense of community. We pride ourselves on being visitor 
friendly, service
-
oriented, and child
-
centered. Our Eagle Family works together in making decisions 
while accepting respo
nsibility for the success of our children.
 
 
Our PTA has been very active with many sponsored events throughout the year. In addition, our 
site features Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers in the areas of Music, Theater Arts, and 
Visual Arts/Graphic 
Design, who also serve as cross
-
curricular Support Teachers who reinforce 
language arts, mathematics, and technology standards.
 
 
Mission
 
EastLake
 
Elementary educates the whole child by nourishing a student's social, academic, and 
verbal growth. Through in
-
school and after school enrichment activities, our students develop into 
independent, kind, responsible citizens who are prepared academically an
d intra
-
personally for 
college and career.
 
 
In support of our mission, we have goals in our site plan to support achievement in English / 
Language Arts, Reading, and Mathematics. Achievement and progress are monitored using a 
variety of data sources: CAASP
P, CELDT, Triennial Progress Reports, Local Measures, and site 
formative assessments.
 
 
Our school
-
wide focus is in the area of California State Standards, enhancing student speaking and 
listening skills with an emphasis on the development of English Langua
ge Learners. Students work 
to increase the ability to read quickly, and effortlessly with meaning and expression, while focusing 
on the meaning and vocabulary words.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a Sch
ool Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local 
Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with dat
a reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the L
CFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or 
the 
district office.

State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

Research shows a high correlation between parent involvement and effective schools.  We encourage parents to 
become actively involved in our school.  
We have Parent Information Nights to keep parents informed about assessment, curriculum and instruction and we provide parent
s with ways in which 
they can become partners with us in the education of their children.
 
 
Parents are an integral part of our decision
-
making process at EastLake.  The School Site Council (SSC) meets monthly to review, revise and update the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement.  The plan ensures student achievement through a rigorous academic p
rogram offering equal access for each 
student.  The SSC oversees the allocation of our Site Budget and Local Control Funding monies.  The English Learner Advisory 
Committee meets quarterly 
to make sure the needs of the ELL students are being met.  The Pare
nt Teacher Association (PTA) supports the school by providing funds and activities 
that benefit the whole school.  Some of the programs funded by them are:  library books, teacher grants, field trips, school 
assemblies, after school 
sports, and technology.
 
This year there are approximately 155 parent volunteers working in classrooms, the library, and in the office.  We have devel
oped 
formal and informal partnerships throughout the community with many business and organizations. These include: The EastLake C
ompany, The EastLake 
Village Centers I & II, Chula Vista Police Department; Chula Vista Fire Department #6; U.S. Border Patrol; and EastLake Middl
e School and High School.  In 
addition, the EastLake Education Foundation (EEF) donates nearly $20,000 each ye
ar to support technology implementation.
 
 
The EastLake School site serves as a center for community activities.  After
-
school student activities include DASH, YMCA, Scouts, cartoon & animation, 
computer coding, robotics, dance, flag football, basketball, s
occer, and music classes.  Weekend activities include a variety of sports and community 
groups.
