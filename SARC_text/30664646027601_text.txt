By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our Mission Is Learning
 
Las Palmas is a community committed 
to bilingualism, biliteracy, and sociocultural competencies by supporting students 
in achieving their personal growth and academic potential.
 
 
Las Palmas Elementary School is located in the beautiful coastal community of San Clemente. Las Palmas was the ci

first school. Once known as San Clemente Grammar School, it has been in use since 1927. Since then, Las Palmas 
Elementary has gone through many changes. In the beginning, the first teachers taught students of many different grade 
levels in one classro
om. In the 1970s, Las Palmas welcomed young Vietnamese refugee children and helped them adjust 
to their new life in the United States. Today Las Palmas is 51% Hispanic and home of the unique Two
-
Way Language 
Immersion Program, which helps students to becom
e fluent in both  Spanish and English. Although the majority of our 
students come from the immediate neighborhood, approximately 40% come from other parts of San Clemente, Dana 
Point, and elsewhere to attend the Immersion Program.
 
 
Las Palmas serves studen
ts in Grades K
-
5 and also runs a state
-
run preschool program that serves over 100 children. The 
total student enrollment is approximately 880 students. The Las Palmas staff consists of 34 certificated and 25 classified 
employees.
 
 
The instructional program
s at Las Palmas are firmly aligned with the Common Core Standards. The overall goal for all 
students is achievement at or above grade level. The instructional goals are literacy, math and technology. Teachers, 
students, and parents work towards these goals
 
through intensive quality instruction offered by highly qualified and fully 
credentialed teachers.  The widely acclaimed Two
-
Way Language Immersion Program is provided to all Las Palmas 
students and brings in students from throughout the district. Student
s complete the program in fifth grade as fully bilingual 
in both Spanish and English.  Las Palmas also offers a STEAM lab, music and art, an organic garden, and many other 
additional programs.
 
 
Las Palmas Elementary School continues to be one of the most s
ought after schools for parents wanting to bring their 
child to a future thinking school that provides a powerful bilingual program while it also focuses on the whole child.  Each 
year there is a long wait list for the kindergarten program.

Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Las Palmas works to keep the school facility safe, updated and clean. Most recently,  we built an organic garden, a STEAM 
lab, and the district put in a new kindergarten yard and grass 

has been very successful as parents and community members work together to  clean up trash and keep the school looking 
beautiful.  Las Palmas works hard to maintain an older facility. Last year 
the field was redone to be safe and an extension 
was added to the organic garden to create additional outside learning areas. This year asphalt work is being completed 
around campus. Ongoing improvements and work is always being done to keep the facility u
pdated and clean and safe.

accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all 
students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only s
tudents who received 
scores.

Las Palmas greatly 
values parent involvement and education.  Parents provide many volunteer hours in the classrooms, 
assisting individual or small groups of children and doing clerical work for the classroom teacher. Our very supportive 
Parent Teacher Association (PTA) and E
nglish Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) works hand
-
in

hand with the school 
to provide feedback, funds and programs, which further enrich the school experience for our students. Approximately 
95% of Las Palmas families join the PTA every year. Fund raisin
g efforts provide students at Las Palmas with enhanced 
technology and field trips. The Las Palmas English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) meets bimonthly and provides an 
opportunity for Spanish speaking parents to access information and offer suggestion
s for the school. Las Palmas also has 
a strong Spanish speaking parent education program having parents graduate from the PIQE program each year. Las 
Palmas also offers free Spanish and English classes for parents.

Capistrano Unified School District places great value on the role of professional learning, and utilizes systems
-
wide 
structures and strategies to promote continuous learning of adults 
that result in increased learning for students.  The 
ongoing focus for professional learning is to support the district's Wildly Important Goal for Teaching and Learning.  It is 
the district goal to engage students in meaningful, challenging, and innovativ
e educational experiences to increase post
-
secondary options for all students.
 
 
It is the goal of  Capistrano Unified School District to ensure all students receive Great First Instruction (GFI).  The visi
on 
for GFI is that all learning environments includ
e Lesson Preparation, Interaction, Strategies, and Review and Assessment 
as defined by the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP).  By design, the model for providing professional 
learning is multi
-
tiered, and ranges from large
-
scale, district
-
w
ide learning opportunities focused on priority areas to site
-
specific, embedded professional learning (including coaching) that supports teachers in the transfer of that learning to the 

lemental training during the summer and after 
school hours to further support district initiatives and teacher needs for ongoing professional learning. The outcome of all 
CUSD professional learning is to improve educator effectiveness in order to increase 
student learning. In support of this 
outcome, administrators participate in professional learning to increase their knowledge of quality practices, California 
Content Standards, and strategies for instructional leadership.
 
 
Since 2004, all schools provide 
specific release time for embedded professional learning using late start or early release 
days.  In grades K
-
8, this time is known as ACE time (Articulation and Collaboration for Excellence).  The purpose of this 
time is for educators to examine the impac
t of their practice on student learning, with a focus on continuous improvement.  
Schools work to identify key areas of learning based on an analysis of student data, upon which they place their focus for 
professional learning and set annual measurable goa
ls based upon those identified areas of need. These areas are 
determined through the analysis of student learning data from multiple sources, including, but not limited to high stakes 
testing. The action plan developed to accomplish these goals outlines pr
iorities for teacher training and implementation.
 
 
Throughout the year, the structure of collaboration typically involves teacher teams engaging in ongoing examination of 
standards
-
based curriculum, the examination of meaningful formative and summative ass
essment data, and powerful 
teaching strategies that get results in student learning. In 2017 the District developed the CUSD Professional Learning 

ze Common 
Goals, Relational Trust, Focus on Learning, Shared Responsibility, Action
-
Oriented, Data Driven, and Systems and 
Structures for Support  to ensure all students are learning at high levels.  These embedded professional learning activities 
help pre
pare teams to provide a differentiated instructional program that meets the needs of all students.
 
 
Beginning teachers receive systematic training and support during their first two years of teaching within the CUSD 
Induction Program. This program assists 
new teachers as they build upon the skills they already possess upon entering the 
field of teaching, and provides them with support from a veteran teacher. The program is approved by the California State 
Commission on Teacher Credentialing and meets the re

to those activities previously described, all teachers may receive support, assistance, and opportunities to grow 
professionally through their participation in school site learning teams, st
udent study teams, from district resource 
teachers, and the Peer Assistance and Review Program.
