About
 
Our
 
School
 
 
Welcome
 
back
 
to
 
our

our
 
new
 
Bulldogs!
 
 
Our
 
school
 
rules
 
are:
 
Be
 
Safe,
 
Be
 
Respectful,
 
Be
 
Responsible
 
and
 
Be
 
an
 
Ally.
 
We
 
continue
 
to
 
practice
 
our
 
"I"
 
messages
 
and
 
solving
 
conflicts
 
in
 
a
 
productive
 
way
 
with
 
adult
 
support.
 
Our
 
goal
 
is
 
that
 
every
 
child

adult
 
on
 
campus
 
feel
 
they
 
belong,

cared
 
for

We
 
encourage
 
all

grow.

rigorous
 
academic
 
expectations,
 
highly
 
qualified
 
teachers,
 
and
 
students
 
who
 
love
 
to
 
learn.
 
We
 
care
 
about
 
the
 
whole
 
child
 
and
 
work
 
hard
 
to
 
meet
 
the
 
emotional
 
needs
 
of
 
every
 
child
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
prepare
 
our
 
students
 
to
 
be
 
college
 
and
 
career
 
ready.
 
We
 
celebrate
 
the
 
diversity
 
of
 
our
 
student
 
population
 
and
 
families
 
and
 
work
 
to
 
create
 
our
 
lessons
 
with
 
an
 
equity
 
lens
 
so
 
our
 
learners
 
see
 
themselves
 
in
 
our
 
classrooms
 
daily.
 
 
Our
 
school
 
mission
 
statement
