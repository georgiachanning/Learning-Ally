About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
c
ontains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which des
cribes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information ab
out SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Parent involvement is a vital component of the educational program at Davidson Middle School. San Rafael City Schools would n
ot be what it is t
oday 
without the contributions of countless parents and guardians who give their time and expertise as volunteers and who share th
eir financial resources to 
support the goals and aspirations of San Rafael schools. The DMS PTO provides each subject area dep
artment with a budget for classroom supplies and
