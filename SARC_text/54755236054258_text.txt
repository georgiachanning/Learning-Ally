Olive Street Elementary School is a K
-
6 School.  Its members share the belief that all students can 
learn. We believe that all students have the potential to become ethical and democratic citizens 
who are optimistic about the future. We see that maximizing the potential of each child as our 
responsibility and charge during their academic years at Olive S
treet Elementary School.
 
 
The teachers at Olive Street Elementary School are educators who value and understand the 
importance of working with young minds. As a professional learning community, we strive for 
continuous improvement of the academic program. 
Teachers are continuously engaged in 
collaborative research, problem
-
solving, and reflective dialogue that enables them to examine their 
practices with the ultimate goal of improving student achievement. Olive Street Elementary School 
continually strives t
o create a college
-
bound academic culture where students play a major role in 
their own learning and education.
 
 
We have emphasized the achievement of every student in every classroom. This approach makes 
sure that poor performance is not acceptable and ea
ch and every adult is accountable to the 
students that sit in front of them every day. By placing a relentless focus on individual performance, 
we have implemented a vital cycle of instruction, assessment, and intervention, followed by more 
instruction, as
sessment, and intervention. We believe in all of our students and will do whatever it 

it comes to their academic success.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additio
nal information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the St
ate priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Olive Street Elementary School. Staff members supervise students on 
campus before school, after 
school, and during recess; no

proper authorization to be on campus. For the safety of our students, all volunteers are fingerprinted and cleared through th
e Depa
rtment of Justice. 
Appointments are made with the school secretary. Once volunteers are cleared, they will receive an identification badge. Visi
tors are asked by the staff 
to display their passes at all times.

The School Site Safety Plan was most recently
 
revised in Fall 2019 by the staff, including campus administration and the school's resource officer. Key 
elements of the plan focus on emergency preparedness. The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations perta
ining to hazardous 
mater
ials and state earthquake standards. Emergency drills are held on a regular basis; fire drills are held once a month, earthqu
ake drills and lockdown 
drills are held throughout the year.
