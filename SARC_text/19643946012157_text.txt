Principal's Message
 
I
 
would like to welcome you to Chaparral Elementary School's Annual School Accountability Report 
Card. In accordance with Proposition 98, every school in California is required to issue an annual 
School Accountability Report Card that fulfills state and federal disclosure requirements. Parents 
will find valuable information about our academic achievement, professional staff, curricular 
programs, instructional materials, safety procedures, classroom
 
environment, and condition of 
facilities.
 
 
At Chaparral Elementary School, we consider ourselves a community of learners, which includes 
students, staff, parents, and business/community partnerships. Through this process we are 
preparing our students to b
e critical thinkers and problem solvers. Our students experience a 
balanced, rigorous, and challenging curriculum that allows for individual differences and fosters 
responsible citizenship in a safe and orderly environment.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
Chaparral Ele
mentary School strongly believes that "every student will experience success each 
day". The Chaparral community prepares its students to be critical thinkers and problem solvers. 
Our students experience a balanced, rigorous, and challenging curriculum that
 
allows for individual 
differences and fosters responsible citizenship in a safe environment.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of 
each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formul
a (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local 
priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, pare
nts/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Avail
ability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Chaparral Elementary School are currently being aligned to the California State 
Standards. Instructional 
materials are selected from the sta
te's most recent list of standards
-
based materials and adopted by the State Board of Education. The district follows 
the State Board of Education's adoption cycle for core content materials (English language arts, math, science, and social sc
ience).
 
 
On Th
ursday, October 17, 2019, the Claremont Unified School District's Board of Education held a public hearing to certify the ext
ent to which textbooks 
and instructional materials have been provided to students. The Board of Education adopted Resolution #06
-
20
20 which certifies as required by Education 
Code ยง60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional materials were provided to all students, including English learners, in the 
district to the extent that each 
pupil has a textbook or instructional materials, or bo
th, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials were 
provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with 
the cycles and content of 
the c
urriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English language arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materia
ls used for their visual/performing 
arts
 
curricula. During the 2018
-
19 school year, Claremont Unified School District provided each student, including English learners, enrolled in a 
visual/performing arts class with a textbook or instructional materials to use in class and to take home. These m
aterials complied with the state's content 
standards and curriculum frameworks.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional through proper facilities mainten
ance and campus supervision. 
Chaparral Elementary School's original facilities were built in 1964; ongoing maintenance and campus i
mprovements ensure facilities remain up to date 
and provide adequate space for students and staff. District maintenance and site custodial staff ensure that the repairs nece
ssary to keep the school in 
good condition are completed in a timely manner. A work
 
order process is used by school and district staff to communicate non
-
routine maintenance 
requests. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority.. 
 
 
Every morning before school begins, the custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards or other cond
itions that need attention prior to students and staff 
entering school grounds. One full
-
time day custodian and two evening custodians (one full
-
time and one part
-
time) are assigned to Chaparral Elementary 
School. The day custodian is responsible for: 
 

 
Log
istical facility support
 
 
Restrooms are checked throughout the day for cleanliness and subsequently cleaned as needed. The evening custodians are respo
nsible for: 
 

 
All cleaning
 
 
The principal communicates with custodial staff daily concerning maintenance and
 
school safety issues.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priorit

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessme
nts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards,
 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the 
University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
