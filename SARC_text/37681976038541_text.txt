School Description
 
Northmont Elementary School, a true neighborhood school where many of our children still walk 
to school, is located in La Mesa. Northmont is proud of 
its California Honor Roll School Award for 
2017, a title well
-
deserved by our students, staff, parents, and community members. To ensure all 
students become lifelong learners is our school goal

 
simplistic, yet powerful, as our students 
today will be the f
uture leaders of tomorrow. Research
-
based best practices and instructional 
strategies guide our program to ensure all learners are exposed to a high
-
quality, high
-
functioning 
educational program where Northmont students will be prepared academically, socia
lly, and 
emotionally for middle and high school, to attend the college of their choice, and to be valuable 
contributing members of society. Northmont is a successful school where we work hard to provide 
a safe environment and address any concerns quickly a
nd in partnership with families and the 
community. We utilize the PeaceBuilder principles and have common expectations for student 
behavior. Our school
-
wide theme of "We Are Family" encourages relationship building and an 
environment where empathy, respect
, and cooperation are priorities. We value the ideals of 
Restorative Justice, and actively facilitate Restorative Conversations among students. Our staff and 
community are engaged in work around "Courageous Conversations" which focuses on equity 
education 
for all members of our school community. Northmont embraces all parents, volunteers, 
and community members to assist in educating our students through PTA
-
sponsored events, 
collaboration with classroom teachers, and community
-
service programs in which our 
students 
participate.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Unde
r the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific acti
vities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Professional 
learning in La Mesa
-
Spring Valley continues evolving to cultivate capacity and efficacy of teachers so that they can ensure high levels of 
learning for each and every student. In recent years professional learning has emphasized developing a common languag
e around high quality teaching 
and learning and building collaborative cultures that promote high levels of learning for all students through professional l
earning communities. This 
work has included a deeper dive into content standards through the selecti
on of essential standards and discussions around mastery and effective 
assessment. In response to student performance data and classroom observation, current professional learning focuses on align
ing instruction to 
standards and student experience, with ex
tra time and resources dedicated to mathematics and English learners.
 
 
New for the 2019
-
20 school year is our Blended Professional Development program which will offer online professional development options while
 
still 
offering face
-
to
-
face 
professional development. Some of the professional learning that we will offer includes: Igniting ELD multi
-
year seminars where 
teachers learn and implement strategies for designated and integrated ELD and using formative assessment to guide standards
-
base
d instruction, Mindful 
Math where participants will develop deeper understandings of math teaching and how to enrich it while making the District ma
th curriculum more 
accessible to their students, and ProAct, which teaches participants techniques they can 
use to deescalate a child's behavior.  Additional professional 
development continues to address professional learning communities, curriculum adoptions, differentiation, special education,
 
NGSS and effective 
integration of technology into instruction.
 
 
Wit
h professional learning communities as a foundation, professional development is approached from multiple angles to ensure th
at it is relevant, 
timely, and targeted to both student and teacher needs. Teachers meet weekly, as a grade level or discipline, to
 
analyze student data and discuss best 
practices to address the needs of each and every student.
 
 
The district offers workshops and multiple
-
day seminars, after
-
school workshops, online courses, and one
-
on
-
one coaching and modeling. Select teachers 
also at
tend conferences and workshops offered through outside agencies.  District staff also partners with principals providing prof
essional development 
at site learning days and staff meetings.
