Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

It was determined that each RUSD school had sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab 
equipment, where appropriate, purs
uant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core 
subjects for use in the classroom and to take 
home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a 
6
-
year cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most 
current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewe
d by all teachers and a recommendation is made to 
the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption
 
 
Riverside Unified 
School District adopts instructional materials on a regular schedule based on State adoptions. All 
students receive appropriate, up
-
to
-
date instructional materials for use in the classroom and at home. All materials 
currently in use have been selected by t
he staff with parent input, and approved by the Board of Education according to 
state adoption requirements. Teachers are provided training in the use of new materials.

Statewide assessments 
(i.e.,
 
California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts
/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Co
re State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California S
tate University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e.,

is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula

Parent involvement is encouraged and valued at Lake Mathews School. Parents are involved through assisting in 
classrooms, joining our Parent Teacher Assoc

participating in many special projects which enrich our school program, such as Art

Go, jog

thon, book fair, carnival, 
basket auctions, field trips, special classroom activities, a
nd family activity nights such as those at local restaurants.
 
 
Parents are encouraged to attend all parent meetings, parent workshops, and are welcomed volunteers in their child's 
classroom. All parents are encouraged to take an active role in their child'
s education through homework and ongoing 
communication.  Our success is due, in large part, to the outstanding parental support and involvement in our students' 
learning. Parents may contact PTA Board Members or Lake Mathews' staff for more opportunities t

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Site Safety Committee is responsible for the development and updating of the school's Comprehensive Safety Plan. A 
Site Comprehensive Safety Plan Checklist is provided by the Pupil Services Department to give guidance on what should 
be included in the 
School's Safety Plan. The Safety Plan is discussed with staff, evaluated, amended/reviewed/updated by 
January 31 of each year. The school's safety committee meets each month.  A School Disaster Preparedness Plan that 
deals with a wide variety of emergency 
situations is incorporated into the School Safety Plan.  Earthquakes, fire, lockdown, 
and active shooter/intruder drills are conducted as required. The key elements of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan 
include an assessment of current status of school c
rime; provisions of any schoolwide dress code including the definition 
of "gang related apparel"; safe movement of pupils, parents and school employees to and from school; strategies in 
maintaining a safe and orderly school environment; visitors on campus;
 
child abuse reporting procedures; disaster 
procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to suspensions, expulsion or mandatory expulsion and other school 
designated serious acts which would lead to suspension or expulsion, notification to teachers,
 
anti
-
bullying policy, 
discrimination/harassment, and school discipline rules and procedures pursuant to EC 35291 and EC 35291.5. The school 
also has an assigned School Resource Officer (SRO).
