By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
: The district places a stro
ng emphasis on ensuring that all schools are safe, clean, environmentally friendly, 
mechanically functional and inviting for students, staff members, and the community. To assist in this effort, the district 
utilizes Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) develope
d by the State of California OPSC and local operations department developed 
inspection survey methods to keep facilities in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. The 
district regularly inspects and reviews the condition of th
e school facilities and surrounding grounds. The district places 
the highest priority on those safeguards that impact the fire, life and safety protection of the students, staff, and school 
buildings. Below is more specific information on the condition of 
the school and the efforts made to ensure that students 
are provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School Buildings
: Toyon was opened in 1955. This school has 20 regular classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library, 
and 
an administration building. In addition to the main building, there are six portable classrooms that have been added 
to accommodate class size reduction to include Transitional Kindergarten (TK) classrooms, a computer lab, and 
instructional programs used b
y the Santa Clara County Office of Education.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order system process is used t
o ensure efficient service and 

in good working order. This site also had interior and exterior lighting upgrades completed through Pro
p. 39 initiatives in 
identified areas throughout the campus.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
: The district has developed cleaning standards and schedules for all schools in the district. 
A summary of these standards and schedules is available at the school 
or the Maintenance & Operations office. The 
principal, with the guidance of the maintenance supervisor works daily with the custodial team to ensure that the cleaning 
standards are met, and that classrooms, restrooms, and campus grounds are kept clean, saf
e, and well
-
maintained.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

students and staff practice evacuating off site. We hold at least one fire drill every month and at least four earthquake 
drills per school year. Our fire and earthquake drills are scheduled 
at different times of the day so that noon duty 
supervisors, elective teachers, and after school programs (YMCA, GATE, Homework Club, and Enrichment) can practice 
these drills.

Individual school sites offer Supplemental Instruction (SI) to students who are below grade level. It is up to each individua
l 
school sit e to 
identify the students who need extra support based upon district benchmarks or teacher recommendations. 
Each school site selects certificated and classified staff to teach these SI classes, usually after school (1 

 
3 days a week). 
Each school also identif
ies the curriculum that will be used. The majority of the school sites select computer

Professional Development this school year occurred on many different levels 

 
before school started (summer of 2019) 
and ongoing throughout the 2019 

 
2020 school year.  The 
district office working with our site principals and curriculum 
leadership teams developed the scope/sequence of the professional development.  Leadership teams reviewed student 
data produced from benchmark tests, ELPAC, and SBAC data, as well as staff fee
dback when developing the scope and 
sequence.
 
 
At the beginning of the school year, all certificated and classified staff participated in two days of professional 
development aligned to their instructional role and needs.  TK
-
5 teachers received training o
n providing effective Tier 1 
instruction in math and ELA.  Special education staff, social workers and psychologists received training on topics pertinent
 
to their needs such as All Learning is Social Emotional, TCI De
-
Escalation, Instructional Scaffolding
 
to Assist and Support 
Student , and Data Collection and Behavior Management.  Middle school staff received specialized training related to the 
content they teach, that focused on the social emotional element of learning as well as recently adopted curricu
lum.  All 
middle school teachers participated in a workshop on understanding gender.  Training for new teachers focused on 

certificat
ed colleagues in order to have the opportunity to collaborate while learning.  They also attended other sessions 
designed to meet their specific professional needs.
 
 
During the school year middle school, science teachers were released up to three days to c
ollaborate on implementation 
of the new science program.  Middle school math and writing teachers scored and/or analyze student benchmarks during 
release days for each grade.  7th grade science teachers were released for 1
-
2 days for training on the distri

comprehensive sexuality program.  Additional training was offered on release day for special education teachers to 
support implementation of our dyslexia curriculum as well as special education components of our ELA programs.

Throughout the school ye
ar, we offered monthly professional development sessions in which all teachers participated (1.5 
hours on 10 early release Thursday afternoons).  Principals and district office administrators chose the topics for the 2019
-
2020 school year in alignment with
 
the District focus on developing a multi
-
tiered system of support.
 
 
The Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL) program was implemented at six of our ten elementary schools in grades TK
-
3.  The schools included were Cherrywood, Laneview, Summerdale, Brookt
ree, Toyon and Vinci Park.   Teachers in the first 
two years of implementation received three two
-
day training modules each followed by a day of unit planning.  Teachers 
in the third and fourth year of implementation participated in three days of unit plan
ning.  Contracted SEAL experts 
provided the module training sessions and three district instructional coaches facilitated the follow up planning PD 
sessions.  Teachers were released from their classrooms for all of these PD days.
 
 
Four instructional coache
s provided BTSA induction training for all teachers who qualified to receive BTSA training and 
support. Additionally, BUSD teachers provide PAR assistance to teachers who are in need of additional assistance.  All 
teachers have access to an instructional c
oach so that they can receive follow up support on implementing new learning 
attended through professional development.
 
 
An MTSS committee and Differentiated Assistance Team received 3
-
5 days of training on change management facilitated 
by WestEd and the S
anta Clara County Office of Education.  Some members also participated in 3 training sessions of 
equity.  Team members then trained principals during monthly professional development meetings.   The focus of both 
teams aligned with the district goal of dev
eloping multi
-
tiered systems of support at each site.
