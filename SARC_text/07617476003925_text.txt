By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Joaquin Moraga Intermediate School is currently comprised of nine buildings, including an 
auditorium, music building, 
gymnasium, library, one computer lab, and one engineering lab. Through funding provided by Measure V, modernization 
efforts will commence in the Summer of 2020. Construction is scheduled to wrap up after the Summer of 2021. The 
district
-
wide project intends to vastly improve the student experience through such initiatives as renovated classrooms 
and a rejuvenated basketball court/student locker room. Furthermore, outdoor walking paths with worn
-
out concrete 
and elevated sections 
are to be fixed completely.
 
 
Joaquin Moraga Intermediate School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and community members. 
Site custodians ensure a sanitary learning space through daily work that is supervised and inspected by site p
rincipals on 
a routine basis. All classrooms, restrooms, and athletic centers are prioritized on the regular cleaning schedule. Outside 
trash is collected daily to reduce an unwanted animal presence on the school campus. The district recently added modern 
cleaning
-
chemical dispensers in the custodian closets to further guarantee the optimal cleaning agent is utilized for the 
right job. The site principal and custodians work in conjunction with the district Director of Buildings and Grounds to seek 
ways to i
ncrease the cleanliness of the JMIS campus regularly. The school is inspected annually by the Fire Marshal and 
periodically by school site administrators.
 
 
The repair and maintenance of Joaquin Moraga Intermediate School are prioritized and implemented by 
the Director of 
Buildings and Grounds. Work is carried out by the members of the Maintenance Department to ensure that the facilities 
remain in excellent repair. Generally, site custodians, secretaries, and principals submit tickets through the work order 
system for the Director of Buildings and Grounds to receive. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority, as is anything
 
that poses a threat to student safety. Priorities for the Maintenance Department to address are the roofs for the Gym 
Building and
 

designated areas of concern are to be addressed during Measure V Modernization, referenced above.

Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud

Note: The numb

umber of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level perc
entages are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are an integral part of the learning community at Joaquin Moraga Intermediate Schooll. Our parent community is 
well
-
informed and articulate, and we make much effort to include parents in all aspects of the functioning of the school. 
Parents volunte
er in classrooms, school projects, serving lunch, and also assist with field trips, class parties and activities, 
copying in the office, and helping at home with many projects and assignments. Our PTA offers many opportunities for 
parents to be involved in
 
school and community related events such as serving as committee chairs and members, 
fundraising activities, legislative action, and communication to other parents.  The School
-
Based Coordinated Program 
Council (SBCP), comprised of staff and parents, meet
s regularly to monitor curriculum and instruction, makes suggestions 
for improvement, and annually approves the Single Site Plan for Student Achievement. The Moraga Education Foundation 
(MEF) raises funds from the community in support of selected instructi
onal programs. Our parent community financially 
supports school personnel, activities, and events through many significant, generous donations.

Five district

wide staff development days were scheduled in each of the school years 2016
-
17, 2017
-
18, 2018
-
19. These 
days were scheduled and held outside the 180
-
day student calendar.  The focus of these professional development days 
in 2018
-
2019 was to e
ducate teachers, administrators and staff about the new common core state standards, specifically 
in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), mathematics, and English Language Arts (ELA).  The focus was selected 
in conjunction with the District's LCAP
 
goals.  In addition, teachers were provided opportunities to attend workshop events 
that focused on learning about common core standards and how their instructional strategies will improve student 
learning.  Release time is provided for teachers to observ
e other classrooms and collaborate about instruction.  The 
Beginning Teacher Induction Program assigns new teachers with a mentor teacher.  This program is a two
-
year mandatory 
program for all new beginning teachers in the Moraga School District. Teachers 
receive support from one another, site 
administrators, consultants and the MSD teacher on special assignment.
