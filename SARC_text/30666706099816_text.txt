About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

maintained and kept 
safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) employs an electronic work order sys
tem enabling school staff 
to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Mo
st of the school's repairs and maintenance projects are 

ither by the school custodian 
or district maintenance staff, based upon the
 
nature of the situation. Day and evening custodians work closely as a team and with the principal for routine 
maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events preparations. The principal and day custodian communicate daily to di
scuss campus cleanin
g 
needs and safety concerns. Every morning before school begins, the custodian, principal, and assistant principal inspect faci
lities for safety hazards, 
graffiti, and other conditions that require removal prior to students and staff entering school ground


rs on proper cleaning 
procedures, use of chemicals, and use of equipment. The 
day custodians are responsible for following an established set of cleaning standards and 
prioritization procedures for general campus maintenance. The day custodian checks restrooms twice a day as a proactive measu
re in keeping facilities 
well stocked, sa
fe, and sanitary. The evening custodians are responsible for thorough cleaning of classrooms, office areas, and restrooms. 
Groundskeepers are dispatched by the district office to perform general maintenance of landscaping, gardening, sports fields,
 
and irr
igation systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of 
study
