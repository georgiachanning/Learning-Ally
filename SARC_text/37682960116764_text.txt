By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Willow Grove is proud of our accomplishments and the recognition we have received in recent years.
 
 
Of our thirty
-
three 
teachers, three are Nationally Board Certified and twenty
-
five 

 
 
A majority of our teachers are 
engaged in the Dis
trict sponsored Teaching and Learning Cooperatives (TLC), participating in intensive professional 
development throughout the year that requires new learning, application of content, and reflection on effectiveness of 
student learning.
 
 
Our teachers are sou
ght out by District directors to be teacher leaders.
 
 
Many facilitate TLCs or other 
District professional development.
 
 
As a Professional Learning Community school, we received the honor of participating 
in 

Learning School Alliance
during 
2009 

 
2010.
  
Our school
 
has been the recipient of
 
six district and 
one national

In 2016, we were selected as a California Gold Ribbon School, and 
in 2012 and 2018 we were selected as a California Distinguished School.
 
 
 
 
One of the greate
st strengths of our school is our firm belief that
 
each and every
 
student can learn.
 
 
Teachers hold 
themselves accountable for the success of each child and are committed to closing the achievement gap for all student 
groups.
 
 
They set high academic and be

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Poway 
Unified School District ensures that students attend clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each of its 
schools is maintained in good repair.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained
.  Playgrounds and fields are  well maintained.  A full time custodian is on every 
campus throughout every school day.  A night custodial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms and offices daily.  The district 
has adopted cleaning standards for all schools.  A 
summary of these standards is available at the district offices.

State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Willow Grove recognizes that parent involvement is vital to our success.
 
 
To that end, Willow Grove is proud to host two 
highly active parent organizations, our Willow Grove Parent Teacher Association (PTA) and our Willow Grove Educational 
Foundation (WGEF
).
 
 
Both of these organizations were chartered before our school even opened and are relentless 
about
 
enhancing educational programs in alignment with our school's mission and vision.
 
 
The WGEF has raised more than 
$300,000, providing  Impact, PE, Music, M
ath Enrichment, Science Enrichment, and Computer Resource teachers as well 
as technology support such as
 
Apple TV, mobile Chromebook carts, iPads, and web
-
based programs and apps.
 
 
Our PTA 
has coordinated approximately fifty programs such as assemblies, Cu
ltural Night,
 
a book fair, Family Movie Night,
 
STEAM 
Night, Running Club, a school garden, school safety improvements, and much more.
 
In addition to our parent 
organizations, we are grateful for our parent volunteers who support our instructional program o
n a daily basis and PTA 
sponsored events.
  
They log thousands of hours each year.
 
 
We are also grateful for our relationship with our business 
partner, I
-
Orthodontics, who has donated funds and sponsored school wide events with great enthusiasm.

Our Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan is reviewed and updated annually as well as when needed throughout the 
year.
 
 
Fire, disaster, lock down, and earthquake
 
drills
 
are carried out
 
throughout the year based on district 
expectations.
 
 
After each drill, 
staff is encouraged to share feedback for improvement.
  
Based on staff feedback, steps for 
improvement are taken if needed.
 
 
For continuous improvement in our
 
school safety practices, our Safety Committee 
meets on a tri
-
monthly basis to review staff feedba
ck regarding drills and to monitor safety goals for the year.
  
Ensuring a 
safe learning environment is Willow Grove's number one priority.
 
 
Our School Safety Team met on 10

Research supports the positive effects professional development has on increasing student learning. All teaching staff is 
afforded the opportunity to participate in district and site  professional development. These workshops are presented in 
a semester or
 
year
-
long series and support a wide variety of professional development. These include the use of effective 
instructional strategies, implementing the use of technology in teaching and learning, critical reading, writing, science,
 
and 
mathematics strategi
es that support implementation of
 
the California
 
State Standards, effective use of assessments, 
positive discipline in
-
services, social emotional support, and cultural proficiency training. Teachers and the principal
 
are 
actively involved in professional d
evelopment activities at the school and
 
district level. The Poway Professional Assistance 
Program (PPAP) provides support for new teachers. Teachers are encouraged to participate in the National Board 
Certification process and are recognized by the Poway U
nified School District when they earn NBCT status.
 
 
Willow Grove
 
operates as a
 
Professional Learning Community, with embedded professional learning during the work day. 
In the spring of every year the Willow Grove staff identifies an instructional focus ar
ea to study for the upcoming school 
year.
 
 
Last year
 
we focused on
 
delving
 
deeper into
 
the
 
California Next Generation Science Standards and instructional 
strategies that support implementation of these standards as well as increasing our knowledge, skills 
and implementation 
strategies that support social/emotional growth (Love & Logic, Michele Borba:
 
 
empathy).
  
This year our learning focus 
is
 
around increasing our expertise in the implementation of our District's ELA curriculum and CORE assessments as well
 
as 
continuing to refine our implementation of the NGSS.
 
 
Not only do we set aside three half
-
day site
-
based professional 
growth days per year for learning together, we also
 
meet twice a
 
month to
 
collaborate, whole staff or in grade level 
teams,
 
around our
 
instructional focus areas (ELA and NGSS
 
Standards).
  
 
We study instructional strategies and share with 
each other best practices for implementation.
 
 
We have partnered with
 
our District ELA TOSA for
 
6 hours of professional 
learning with a focus on the
 
imp
lementation of our District's newly adopted ELA curriculum.
  
In addition, teachers 
are
 
using their X
-
Ploration Days to collaborate with colleagues to increase their expertise in their implementation of ELA 
curriculum and NGSS.
