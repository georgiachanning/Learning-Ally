School Description
 
Welcome to Dr. Oscar F. Loya Elementary School, home of the Loya Lions! The students of Dr. Oscar 
F. Loya School will be successful members of a multicultural society in the information age. They 
will be prepared to think creatively, sol
ve problems, and achieve high academic goals.
 
 
Dr. Oscar F. Loya Elementary School is located in the eastern section of the city of Salinas.  Our 
school serves an ethnically and economically diverse community.  There are approximately 660 
students in grade
s preschool through 6th grade.  Our student population is:  1% Black or African 
American, 4% Filipino, 96% Hispanic or Latino, <1% Korean, <1% Other Pacific Islander, <1% 
Samoan, and 1% White. 70% of our students are English Learners, 13% Gifted, 18% Migra
nt and 
28% Students with disabilities.   Under No Child Left Behind Criteria 80% of our teachers are fully 
credential and meet the Federal and State Standards of Highly Qualified.
 
 
The school began with the concept of TEAMWORK and this concept continues to
 
permeate 
throughout the school.  Teachers work together in grade level and cross
-
grade level teams to 
analyze data and share best research based practices.  Over 70% of the teachers have taught at Dr. 
Oscar F. Loya for at least ten years, since the school
 
opened. The teaching staff at Dr. Oscar F. Loya 
has an average of 28 years experience with approximately 30 students per teacher in grades TK
-
2nd  and 30 students per teacher in grades 3rd 

 
6th.  The curriculum is delivered by 25 full time 
Classroom Teac
hers, 4 Special Education Teachers, which includes the Resource Specialist Teacher, 
and 1 Instructional Coach.  We also have 3 highly qualified intervention teachers who target grades 
K
-
3 students working at a below average level, and our newcomer students
 
across K
-
6th grade.  
Additionally, Dr. Oscar F. Loya has implemented 3 Core Values (Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be 
Safe), which fall under Restorative Justice, and Positive Behavior Intervention System (PBIS).  These 
promote good citizenship skills and
 
positive behavior. Trimester recognitions take place to 
recognize students who are demonstrating positive citizenship and academic success. Nonetheless, 
Dr. Oscar F. Loya Elementary is working diligently to implementing the Multi
-
Tiered System of 
Supports
 
(MTSS) to meet all students academic, behavior and emotional needs.
 
 
A strong instructional leadership team supports the efforts of staff to help shape classroom 

ip 
Team consists of one teacher per grade level, including a Special Education teacher, and our 
Instructional Coach.  Our school has aligned curriculum with the California State Common Core 
Standards and State Board adopted textbooks. The curriculum being 
delivered has a planned 
sequence of instruction and learning experiences appropriate to the various developmental levels 
of students.  To achieve our school vision and to meet the state Academic Performance Index (API) 
and Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) ta
rgets, we have set rigorous academic goals for our students. 
We instill positivity and motivation to all our students, and hold them accountable for meeting 
learning targets.  Teachers hold each  other accountable by delivering effective instructional 
prac
tices in the classroom, and consistently reviewing and modifying instruction based on student 
data. As a committed staff, we believe every child will be proficient and independent reader by the 
end of third grade, and every child will meet grade
-
level stan
dards in language arts and 
mathematics. Our committed teachers will integrate the use of technology to enhance standards
-
based instruction and English Language Development, teachers will participate in professional 
development that supports the core academ
ic subjects, focusing on Common Core Standards, 8 
Mathematical Practices, English & Spanish Language Arts and English Language Development.

Our staff is also committed to continuous professional development in academic language and writing via Guided Language Acqui
sition 
D
esign and Write up a STORM strategies.  Teachers are trained and coached by an additional coach to support effective delivery
 
of 
instruction, hence student learning.  In addition, the library is a media center utilized by students, as well as the school 
co
mmunity.  The 
library is open daily from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Parents have a set time in which they are allowed to come read and take Accele
rated Reader 
Quizzes with their child. It is a way to motivate our students and have parents involved.  Nonetheless, 
our staff will provide parents with 

s.
 
 
For our second language learners, there is a One
-
Way Program offered in 
Kindergarten
-
Third Grade, and a Bilingual Transference Program 
for fourth grade students.  Kinder through 6th grade students are taught in English only or Structured English Immersion Prog
rams.   As 
students transition to English Only Instruction they are 
supported by offering struggling students or students who are not meeting 
standards levels in K
-
3rd grade with additional English Language Arts support by their homeroom teacher or instructional coach, as well 
as the K
-
3 intervention teacher. In addition e
very English Learner receives English Language Development Support in their classrooms.  
Teachers provide our English Learners with different scaffolds, such as graphic organizer via GLAD and STORM, visual supports
, picture 
cards, realia, language/sentence
 
frames, and others.  We continue to equip English Learners with the English language skills needed for 
academic success through daily English Language Development.
 
 
Dr. Oscar F. Loya has an on
-
site State Preschool Program via Title I and Migrant Education
 
Program that serves students that are 3 to 4 
years of age.  Most students from the state preschool attend kindergarten at Dr. Oscar F. Loya. We also offer twice a week Fi
rst Five 
opportunities for parents and children ages 0
-

In order to meet the emoti
onal needs of our students, Dr. Oscar F. Loya Elementary provides counseling services via our District counselor, 
which also provides parenting workshops and classroom demonstrations.  A Monterey County Behavioral Health therapist  is also
 
available 
to pro
vide emotional support to students suffering from emotional disturbances/traumas (i.e. abuse, domestic violence, grief/loss, 
divorce/separation, gangs, drugs/alcohol, etc...). A check
-
in/check
-
out system is in place to support our Tier 3 students under the
 
emotional umbrella.  Tucci Learning Solutions also provide services to students in Tier 3 needing behavior and emotional 
interventions/supports. These services are rendered by a highly qualified Tucci Behavioral Specialist, who works 1:1 on a dai
ly basis 
with 
the learner.  A behavioral analyst and case manager are assigned to a student to gather data and work closely with classroom 
teacher, 
and families. Additionally, parent, teacher, administrations, and Tucci staff hold meetings regularly to discuss stud
ents progress, concerns, 
and or additional supports.
 
 
The School Site Council in combination of the ELAC Committee meet monthly to review student achievement data, analyze the 
effectiveness of programs, determine the progress of actions in the school plan,
 
share effective parenting workshops, and revise the 
school plan as needed.
 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

and volunteers. Staff members and students practice monthly safety drills. We have established procedure
s to ensure the safety of all school members. 
The safety plan is reviewed annually at the end of May and includes procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and inventories 
of emergency supplies. We 
make the plan available in the school office and review it 
with all staff at our first staff meeting, and mid year to ensure that everyone is clear about the 
emergency procedures.
