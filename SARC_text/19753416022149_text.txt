By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parent

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
A large part of our success stems from our relationship with parents and community members. Decision making is shared 
among parents and staff through School Site Council, PTA Board, The Wellness Council, as well as through a variety of 
volunteer leadership
 
opportunities open to parents. In addition to the enormous role parent volunteers play in our 
communication system, parents are given leadership roles for curriculum and enrichment support in the following ways:
 

 
School Site Council/English Learner Advisor
y Committee (ELAC): An elected group consisting of parents and 
staff members who help advise the principal on decisions around school safety, annual school goals, and English 
Language Learner programs.
 

 
Family Science Night: A small committee and several pa
rent volunteers coordinate a special family event 
centered around STEM including special guests including science professionals and talented science educators 
visit Tulita to engage students in special science assemblies and class sessions to enhance Tulit

education. PTA also supports this event by helping to coordinate the Science Fair.
 

 
Walking School Bus: In coordination with Beach Cities Health District, a parent coordinates several Walking 
School Bus routes. Walking School Bus Volunteers walk
 

up registered children along the route and safely walking with the children to school. We have four Walking 
School Bus routes running twice a week.
 

 
Hands on Art: Completely run by parent volunteers, t
his enrichment program offers art lessons to all students 
based on the works of famous artists.
 

 
Book Fairs: Two book fairs per year, organized by parent volunteers not only promote reading, but writing as 
well.
 

 
Running Club: Parents coordinate 
Running Club three days a week at Tulita. Students and parents are invited to 
come to the playground from 7:30
-
8am on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday to walk, jog or run. Students earn 
sticks and we keep track of their mileage. They earn awards and medals. Th
e school also encourages the Tulita 
community to sign up for local runs in the community.
 

 
Career Day: Another volunteer opportunity for parents is our school
-
wide career day where parents present 
information and demonstrations of what they do for a living.
 

 
Battle of the Books: 3rd
-
5th grade parents coordinate this reading competition program for Tulita upper grade 
students. PTA also supports Battle of the Books in terms of purchasing materials and providing hospitality.

The Redondo Beach Unified School District is focusing staff professional development (PD) in three main areas: effective 
instructional strategies aligned to California State Standards at schools sites; use of technology in 
instruction; and the 
supporting of the social, emotional, and behavioral needs of all students, particularly through the implementation of 
Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS) in all schools. While the current PD does focus on instructional
 
and 
curriculum in mathematics, English, and science, the RBUSD is also developing PD for History Social Science standards.
 
 
The RBUSD is engaged in a multi
-
layered approach to delivering PD. The District provides PD through: teacher release 
time; conferen
ce attendance; one
-
day workshops; mentoring; book studies; and after
-

elementary schools utilize weekly collaborative planning time through the implementation of a School Instructional 
Leadership Team and grade level leads.
 
 
Ta
rgeted teacher development activities are essential for increasing the quality of education to students. The below topics 
are a few of the professional development areas for this school year:
 

 
Reading strategies and understanding text complexity
 

 
MTSS and Ti
er 2 Intervention Strategies
 

 
Supporting students with disabilities through inclusive practices and co
-
teaching
 

 
Grade level articulation
 

 
Professional Learning Communities (PLCs)
 

 
Student mental health
 

 
Suicide prevention
 

 
Mastery Learning
 

 
Examination of student assessment results
 
The use of student data is critical to better assess and support individual student development. The District provides 
training on our student data management, Performance Matters, to analyze individual and aggrega
te student progress. 
Elementary teachers and secondary math teachers receive ongoing training and support on diagnosing students learning 
targets and adjusting instruction to increase number sense.

Internal PD offerings are supplemented by partnering with
 
external professional development organizations, including 

teachers and administration on instructional programs for all students.
 
 
Our new tea
chers are supported at school sites and at the District level through the Beginning Teacher Support and 
Assessments (BTSA) Program where each new teacher is mentored by a BTSA support provider. By working with BTSA, a 
new teacher receives support and resou
rces to improve their teaching pedagogy.
 
 
Through the collective bargaining process, additional paid professional development days are included in the teacher work 
calendar.
