Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Mission Estancia Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff and volunteers. School facilities 
were built in 1990 and
 
currently include the media center, multi
-
purpose room, staff lounge, 29 permanent classrooms, 
two playgrounds and a beautiful school garden used by both students and the school community. Facility information in 
this report was current as of March 2019. 
Mission Estancia replaced five portable classrooms for five permanent 
structures. Additionally, a wing of the new structure serves as the new library that better supports the demands of the 
technology than the previous location.
 
 
District maintenance super
visors are proactive and conduct inspections at school sites on a continual basis. Repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that eme
rgency repairs are given the highest priority. District maintenance has 
indicated that 100% of all toilets on school grounds are in working order.

Maintaining a safe and orderly environment is essential to learning. The Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP) is 
developed by Mission Estancia Elementary in consultation with 
local law enforcement/Emergency Preparedness staff, 
School Site Council (SSC) and Administrative Services in order to comply with Senate Bill 187. It was most recently updated 
and reviewed in September 2019 and accepted by the Board of Trustees in November
 
2019.
 
 
The CSSP includes elements such as emergency plans and procedures, including the Run, Hide, Fight Model, the School 
Protection Evacuation Plan for Wildfire, school rules and school dress codes. Fire drills are conducted monthly, earthquake 
drills a
re held four times a year, and two lockdown exercise drills are practiced each year. All schools in the district are 
closed campuses, and visitors must immediately register in the school office before entering the campus. School access is 
monitored by admi
nistrators, teachers and other school staff.
