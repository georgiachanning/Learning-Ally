About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have
 
books in core classes for all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far mor
e meaningful when along with 
the more detailed description of textbooks conta

in our core classes and their dates of publication.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Each school site has classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library and an administration 
building. The number of classrooms at each school site varies, 
depending on enrollment and available space. Several sites have portable classrooms to accommodate increased enrollment and t
o meet the guidelines 
for Class Size Reduction (CSR) where implement
ed.
 
 
This school has 32 classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library, and an administration building. The main campus was built in 1
954.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair a
nd working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. Taft Montes
sori School received a new 
paint job during the summer, 2013. A new security s
ystem was installed in 2014, as well as a new alarm system.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that all classrooms, restrooms, and facilities are 
well
-
maintained and in good 
repair. The 
principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Stockton Unified takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, we
 
utilize the facil
ity survey instrument 
developed by the State of California OPSC. The full report is available upon request.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced 
Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the 
number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether t
hey received a score or not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following
 
information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Our school pl

ool facilities 
are in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. Each year a deep cleaning process occurs
 
during a close of school, either during 
the summer or other extended break. In the event of a facility plant emergency, the principal notifies appropriate site and d
istrict personnel to resolve 
the emergency and safely secure or evacuate the students, bas
ed upon the site and district emergency preparedness plans. A site review with the district 
Internal Evaluation Instrument (IEI) was collected.
 
 
A comprehensive School Safety Plan, which was most recently reviewed in by the School Site Council, helps to pr
ovide a secure, peaceful and clean 

ies and natural disasters. 
Emergency drills are conducted on a regular basis.
 
 
Every effort is m
ade to ensure students are monitored while on campus throughout the school day. Yard supervisors, Campus Safety Assistant, te
achers, 
site administrators and school staff provide supervision for students before and during school. The playground is safe for 
all students. All visitors must 
sign in at the office and receive proper authorization to be on campus. Visitors must display their passes at all times.
