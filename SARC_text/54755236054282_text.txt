About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by sta
te 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are requi
red to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to
 
be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For mo
re information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact th
e school principal or the 
district office.

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Vandalia Elementary School. Staff members supervise students on camp
us before and after school 
and during recess; noon duty supervisors m
onitor students during the lunch break. Fencing surrounds the entire campus.  Entrance into the campus 

 
their IDs through the Rapto
r 
System to be on campus. Visitors are required to display their pass at all times.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan was most recently revised in Fall 2019 by the staff, including campus administration and the scho
ol's resource officer . Key 
elements of the pl
an focus on emergency preparedness. The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous
 
materials and state earthquake standards. Emergency drills are held on a regular basis; fire drills are held once a month, ea
rthqu
ake drills are held twice 
a year and lockdown drills are held three times a year.  Students in all grade levels have access to the internet and iPads f
or learning.  An internet filter, 
staff supervision, and the Common Sense digital citizenship program equ
ip students with tools to be safe while using technology. The school implements 
the PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention Program) to teach students correct ways to conduct themselves in a variety of areas 
of the classroom and school 
campus.  Students are r
ecognized and rewarded for their positive behaviors.

observations are designed to encourage common goals 

probationary teachers are evaluated annually and tenured teachers are evaluated every other year.

ed and certified for competency to perform teacher evaluations. Evaluation criteria 
includes the following:
 

 
Engaging and Supporting all Students in Learning
 

 
Understanding and Organizing Subject Matter for Student Learning

Planning Instruction and Designing Learning Experiences for all Students
 

 
Developing as a Professional Educator
 
Staff members build teaching skills and concepts through participation in conferenc
es and workshops throughout the year. For the past three years, the 
district has offered two staff development days. In addition, this year the district implemented an Early Release Schedule ea
ch Wednesday for staff 
collaboration and development. Teachers 
also collaborate with their grade level team weekly to build Project
-
Based learning units, Common Core units 
and lessons, and to evaluate learning through assessment data. The Learning Director meets with teachers, models lessons, and
 
assists teachers with
 
implementing shifts in teaching practices. Teachers also utilize the District Instructional Coaching Team for support in thei
r teaching strategies. Staff 
meetings are also devoted to professional development in the areas of English Language arts and Mathe
matics teaching and learning methods.
 
 
During this time, teachers are offered a broad
-
based variety of professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies. 
The school uses the Best Practices teaching strategies and teach
ers are trained in the techniques each year.
