Our staff is here to foste
r and support you and your student in the pursuit of excellence. Parents are a vital part of the N.E.S.T. (Nurture 
Every Student's Talent)! We ask that you be active and engaged in your child's education. It is essential in developing a str
ong partnership 
between home and school. Whether you are working full time or stay at home, make sure you take time everyday to connect and b
e 
present with your child. Talk to your child about what they are doing in school, have your child read to you, provide a quiet
 
pla
ce to do 
homework everyday, and help your child stay organized! We are a school where everyone shares in the responsibility for the su
ccess of 
every one of our students. We cannot do it alone. Here's to a strong year of teamwork, community building, inclus
ion, and a commitment 

 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

We recognize the tremendous impact parental engagement has on student achievement and encourage parents and guardians to beco

their child's education. We offer a variety of parental involvement opportunities th
roughout the school year to include, but are not limited, to serving as 
a member on school parent advisory committees, such as School Site Council (SSC), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC),
 
or participating in 
ongoing parent surveys to provide much
 
needed feedback for overall program improvement. SSC and ELAC meetings are held throughout the year and 
are open to the public.
 
 
In an effort to provide meaningful parent workshops, we have contracted the services of Fresno County Office of Education to 
p
rovide parent training 
and workshops focused on how parents can assist their student/s with homework, study skills, and parenting workshops. In addi
tion, several Family 
Nights (Literacy, Math, & STEAM) will be offered throughout the year.
 
 
The Parent and F

the local police 
departments in Coalinga and Huron for School Resource Officers.

ected staff participate in AED 
and CPR 
training. For the 19
