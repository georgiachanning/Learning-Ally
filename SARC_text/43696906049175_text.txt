School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Cumberland is a place where students and the community truly embrace "Learning and Beyond."  Students relate 
classroom learning to real world events.  Home to 780 culturally diverse children, Cumberland has an eager, dedicated 
staff
 
of professionals, an active parent community and a daycare center.  Approximately 65% of the student population 
represents ethnic minorities, predominately Asian (44%), Hispanic (5%), and Other (13%).  The Cumberland students, staff, 
parents, and communit
y work together to maximize each student's learning potential and self worth by promoting and 
modeling respect for fellow students, staff, school property and community.  All students are expected to meet 
attendance, performance, homework and behavior stan
dards.  Cumberland provides a safe and nurturing environment as 
well as the necessary tools to support its mission: to develop globally aware learners who are compassionate problem 
solvers and leaders.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Parent/guardian involvement opportunities are a strength at Cumberland.  There are opportunities for all 
parents/guardians to be actively involved in their child's education through a range of volunteer activities.  We continue 
to strive to meet the needs 
of the parents/guardians of English language learners and to ensure that all opportunities are 
broad
-
based and inclusive.  This goal is shared by the PTA, School Site Council, and our English Learner Advisory 
Committee.  Additional opportunities for involv
ement include: District English Learner Advisory Committee, Technology 
Team, Environmental Volunteer Program, Cumberland Community Garden, Read Naturally tutoring support, Kindergarten 
Motor Perception and Movement Exploration, FAME, Clay Docents, Family M
ath and Science Night, Project Cornerstone, 
and a variety of parent education classes offered through PTA and the district.  We also offer events throughout the year, 
including the International Fair, a Variety Show, Walk and Roll to School, Primary and Up
per Grade Science Fairs, the Book 
Fair, field trips, and Field Day.  Additionally, our fourth and fifth grade students are offered 3 sessions of Content Cluste
r 
Classes towards the end of the school year.  Parents and teachers also help coordinate and lead
 
a multitude of after school 
enrichment programs such as Math Olympiad, Coding Classes, Foreign Language Classes, Young Rembrandts Arts program, 
Band, and more.
