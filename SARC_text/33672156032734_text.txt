By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019

others, and have many opportunities for academic success and to a
pply their knowledge. We foster a shared leadership, 
involve our parents and community and pride ourselves in making and encouraging positive choices. Our goal is for our 
students to be prepared with all skills and knowledge they will need to be successful
 
in future academic or career paths.
 
 
Our ultimate goal at Mountain View  is to help each and every student reach the highest level of academic success in a 
safe and welcoming environment. At Mountain View, collaboration between teachers, staff members, an
d families is 
critical. Our program prepares students for the future. We are instilling lifelong skills for our students to be college and 
career ready. All students receive instruction that supports mastery of the California Common Core State Standards. 
T
eachers regularly meet to discuss effective teaching strategies, and  analyze data to determine what steps need to be 
taken to ensure that our students develop a deep understanding of the California Common Core State Standards. Our goal 
is that students ca
n understand at a level that they not only can explain in academic terms, concepts, and skills, but that 
they can teach it!
 
 
Mountain View is a Title 1 school, with approximately 900 students, located in Riverside Unified School District. The school 
opened
 
in 1956. We have implemented several programs to help students be successful:
 
To help our students fully master the California Common Core State Standards, teachers have had extensive staff 
development in Language Arts and Math. Assessments are common cor
e standard aligned. Our after school Hearts 
program is offered to students in grades 1 
-
 
6 to provide homework assistance, enrichment programs and clubs. We have 
several clubs on campus including Student Council, Girls Who Code, Boys Coding Club and 100 Mi
le Club. We have a 
Primary Intervention program for students who are reading below grade level in grades K
-
3. Our intervention teacher 
works closely with the classroom teachers to strategically plan effective lessons based on the Reading Foundational Skill
s. 
Our goal is to have all students reading by third grade. Intensive reading support is provided daily for students in the 
classroom and through the primary intervention program. Progress monitoring is a key part of the program. This year, 
WonderWorks is 
offered as a "push
-
in" model to our 4
-
6 grade students. WonderWorks supports struggling readers and 
writers through research
-
based, data
-
driven, systematic instruction. WondersWorks rapidly accelerates students back to 
grade
-
level standards and promotes li
teracy by building foundational skills, developing close reading skills, providing 
differentiated instruction with scaffolded support, and informing instruction through assessment.  For students who have 
special needs, health impairments, or learning disab
ilities, we have a Student Study Team, 1 Resource Specialist Program 
Teacher, 4 Special Day Class Teachers for preschool and grades 3
-
4 and 5
-
6, 2 Speech Pathologists, a school Psychologist 
and a Student Assistant Plan (SAP) Counselor.
 
 
Mountain View offer
s Dual Language Immersion (Spanish/English) beginning in Kindergarten using the 90/10 model.  Our 
Dual Language Immersion program began in the 2013
-
14 school year with Kindergarten only. One grade
-
level per year will 
be added through the 2019
-
20 school yea
r when all grades K
-
6 will be included.  Our Dual Language Immersion teachers 
are all state certified (BCLAS) and receive specialized training in order to provide the highest quality instruction in respe
ct 
to language development and academics.

This year,
 
we have made great strides to incorporate technology in the classroom. Each student in grades 3
-
6 have their 
own Chromebook and grades K
-
2 enjoy the use of digital devices at a ratio of one device to every two students.  We have 
purchased Accelerated Read
er and Lexia  to motivate reading as well as ST Mathematics to support mathematical 
conceptual learning and  grade level standards. In addition, students use the computers to research, write reports, 
collaborate, complete homework, communicate with staff, 
build computer skills and for educational games.
 
 
Our Positive Behavior Initiative (PBIS) program and PBIS team has worked to
 
improve school
-
wide social skill expectations 
and the program. Along with the Six Pillars of Character Counts we have incorporated social skills that are taught every 
week. We have created a series of incentives for our students who practice positive beha
vior on campus.
 
 
We have a great working team at Mountain View and it is a true privilege to work with an amazing group of students and 
a team of hard working professionals who work together to make Mountain View an extraordinary place to learn!

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula

Instructional staff were provided with six half
-
day release days of professional development in support of planning and 
instruction through the inquiry cycle. During these MTSS (Multi
-
Tier System of Support) meetings, teams discussed 
possible instructional
 
responses and commit to a planned response. With each successive convening, they evaluated the 
impact of their planned responses using new formative data, and repeated the learning cycle. Mountain View teachers in 
grades kindergarten through second grade 
worked directly with a consultant from Literacy & Learning Systems LLC, Dr. 
Leonard for 7 days. The consultant supported K
-
2 teachers with planning for Tier 1 Instruction of Standards for Reading 
Foundational Skills and ELA/ELD Standards through a data bas
ed problem solving process aligned with research
-
based 
instructional practices. Teachers in grades third and fourth will receive four days (including Instructional Design Days and 
Learning Round days) working directly with the support of InnovatedEd to foc

practices in the areas of formative and summative assessment, data analysis, instructional planning, and evaluation of 
learning outcomes. Instructional staff were able to select training from the district's on
line professional development 
system which included many instruction
-
related topics. Some trainings are offered during the school day and others are 
offered after school. Mountain View administrators continue to work with instructional staff providing coac
hing of 
teachers and teams. Professional development specific to programs such as Dual Language Immersion and AVID 
Elementary are provided in both on
-
site and off
-
site models by the District. Teachers new to the profession wereafforded 
the benefit of our d
istrict Beginning Teachers Support and Assessment Program wherein coaching, modeling, observation 
visits and competencies practices are incorporated. Instructional staff were able to select training from the district's onli

The Riverside Unified School District and Mountain View Elementary School are committed to provide high
-
quality, 
research

based 
professional development to all of its teachers. School administrators, teachers, and paraprofessionals 
attended district and site
-
based professional development activities, as well as outside conferences and trainings relevant 
to current curriculum, instr
uctional programs or student well being.
 
 
Teachers were supported during the implementation of various strategies delivered at trainings through a variety of 
methods. Administration and site mentors (Math, Technology, Early Literacy, ELA/ELD, English Learn
er personnel and 
mentors) were all available to assist and troubleshoot. In addition, teachers in grades 3
-
6 were offered two release days 
and K
-
2 are offered 3 release days with their grade level teams to discuss upcoming units of instruction in conjuncti
on 
with the standards and how they can incorporate the researched based strategies they were trained on. Evidence of 
learning was portrayed through formal and informal testing data. Communication through principal
-
teacher conferences, 
walk

, and staff meetings were also methods of support.
 
 
All teachers TK

Staff development is provided through meaningful activities that assist teachers in staying abreast of
 
new techniques and 
methodologies in educational topics have focused on improving and meeting the current standards, increasing the rigor 
in the core curriculum, and effective teaching strategies for English Learners. Our teachers have been trained on ELA/
ELD 
and Math Common Core Standards. We have also had training on Eureka, ST Math, DIBELS, IDEL, ELPAC, Next Generation 
Science Standards, Amplify, AVID Elementary, and SELSocial and Emotional Learning. We have attended conferences, 
provided staff developme
nt on campus after school and provided individual mentoring support through our district 
Instructional Service Specialist and Staff Developers. Staff development activities reflect a planned, focused and 
coordinated program which addresses both individual 
and school wide goals. Staff members are involved in the process 
of identifying areas of need in order to set interventions for students during small group instruction time. Staff 
development activities concentrate on improving the school program for stude
nts and upgrading skills of the school staff 
in order to increase student achievement. We work collaboratively with the district by having site teachers represent us 
at the district committee meetings. Our focus this year in 19
-
20 is intensive explicit ins
truction during small group 
instruction.
 
 
The highly qualified staff members at Mountain View collaborate regularly during Wednesday minimum days to support 
student learning. During these curriculum planning and collaboration afternoons, grade
-
level teams 
use student 
achievement data to examine program effectiveness and develop intervention strategies in order to provide an exemplary 
learning environment for all students. From that process, suggestions are made for whole school staff development 
opportuniti
es to ensure academic gains for all students. The weekly collaboration afternoons are planned at the beginning 
of the year and include grade
-
level and whole staff opportunities for professional growth and collaboration.
