Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Mount Shasta Elementary School, located 75 miles south of the Oregon border at the base of its 14,1
62 foot namesake, 
houses a TK
-
3rd grade school of around 230 students. Our team consists of a half
-
time principal, twelve fully credentialed 
classroom teachers, 2.25 FTE credentialed specialists, .5 FTE credentialed counselor, paraprofessionals, and suppor
t staff 
all working collaboratively to provide a quality education to all of our children academically, emotionally, and physically. 
As our vision states, we strive to be a leader of educational excellence in the state of California.  The mission of the Mo
unt 
Shasta Union School District is to promote a system of educational excellence providing the opportunity for all students 
to become productive citizens and achieve high academic standards.   To support our vision and mission, the following 
three aims dr
ive every decision we make to ensure success:
 
 

 
Aim 1: Maximize student achievement
 
 

 
Aim 2: Ensure safe, secure, and well maintained schools
 
 

 
Aim 3: Function with increasing efficiency and effectiveness.
 
 
 
With a
 
clear vision and goals to guide us, we provide a strong curriculum, effective teaching strategies, appropriate 
materials, and sufficient support to ensure all students become proficient in the standards. Through data
-
driven 
instruction, we maintain a bala
nced language arts and math program. Every trimester, we assess our students' abilities in 
reading, writing, and math to tailor our intervention plans.
 
 
Our students receive whole
-
group instruction along with small
-
group guided lessons that differentiate i
nstruction.
 
 
To further support students who may be struggling, we run targeted 
Title I reading and math programs.
 
 
Our Title I intervention teachers and our special education teacher work very closely 
to customize the perfect intervention plan for our stu
dents.
 
 
Our school has a leveled book room so students have access 
to a wide variety of interesting stories to read at their specific reading level to help them grow their reading 
skills.
 
 
Furthermore, there are leveled libraries in our classrooms from whi
ch students can choose books to read.
 
 
We have 
a science lab that was funded through the Mt. Shasta Education Foundation where students go to immerse themselves in 
hands
-
on activities related to the Next Generation Science Standards.
  
 
 
The Mount Shasta ar
ea offers many natural resources that can be incorporated into our outdoor science programs.
 
 
We 
integrate reading, writing, and math into our science and social studies curriculum and offer myriad opportunities for our 
students to apply their skills to re
al
-
world problems and their solutions. 
 
Finally, we take great pride in the fact that we 
offer a strong music education program for our students during the school day, and volunteers also run a thriving after
-
school choir program that is meeting  great suc
cess.
 
 
Our students and families are supported through a variety of classroom activities and community organizations. With our 
Peaceful Playground and Second Step programs, students learn to resolve conflicts among themselves, rather than 
expecting adults 
to intervene. The Mt. Shasta Resource Center, First 5 Siskiyous, Siskiyou Child Care Council, PIE (Partners 
in Education), The Mt. Shasta Education Foundation, Boys and Girls Club, and the Mt. Shasta Recreation Department are 
all integral parts of providin
g a well balanced education for our students. 
 
There is before and after
-
school daycare 
available to families on site.

Parents are active 
partners in our educational community. Their contributions and participation are multi
-
faceted. There 
is a School Site Council that meets monthly. Partners in Education (PIE) is a district
-
wide fund raising body and a project
-
oriented group of parents who 
meet monthly to continually seek ways to provide support for the school and its goals. 
Parents serve on our District Safety Committee, and they are responsible for approving our Comprehensive School Safety 
Plan each year.
 
 
The CAFE committee is a group of 
parents and community members who focus on nutrition education 
and providing quality meals for our students.
 
 

presenters, tutors, buddies, and mentors. Many of our parents and community
 
members provide connections to the 
classrooms through their businesses or professions.
 
 
If you are interested in serving alongside other parents in any of these 
capacities, please call the school office at (530) 926

Mount Shasta Union School District provides three staff development days. This year one staff development day was 
dedicated to grade level collaboration.
 
 
Grade levels participated in common planning of curriculum for the upcoming 
school year and developme
nt of common assessments.
 
 
For the second professional development day, teachers and aides 
traveled to Grenada to attend a county
-
wide training on restorative practices.
 
 
For the third day, held after the school year 
started, teachers and aides had one hou
r to collaborate in classrooms, and the rest of the time was dedicated to staff 
development around our new supplemental leveled readers from Fountas & Pinnell.
 
 
Each year, an outside math 
consultant works with some of our K
-
6 teachers in a job
-
embedded tra
ining model to provide lesson coaching with our 
teachers and students.
 
 
Newly hired teachers participate in the Alliance for Teacher Excellence (ATE). This program partners each new teacher 
with an experienced teacher who serves as a mentor and coach. Part
icipants receive ongoing training for two years.
 
 
 
Professional Learning Communities have provided structure to regular staff collaboration as MSE's teachers focus on:
 
 
1.
 
What do we want to teach?
 
 
2.
 
When are we going to teach it?
 
 
3.
 
How will we assess what we'v
e taught?
 
 
4.
 
How will we respond if students do or don't understand what we've taught and assessed?
 
 
Additionally, many teachers and administrators are released from duty to attend workshops or conferences conducted 
throughout the year.
 
 
This year, some teac
hers are participating in the Teacher Leadership Academy and job
-
embedded 
professional development around writing led by the county office of education.
 
 
Ongoing professional development for 
principals in the district has included monthly meetings at the c
ounty office of education, and district
-
held administrative 
meetings to address current trends in education as well as annually required updates and trainings.
