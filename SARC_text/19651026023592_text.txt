By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our goal at Valley View Elementary School is to provide a solid ed
ucation for all students to master Common Core State 
Standards in an environment that cultivates character, promotes critical thinking, and inspires the love of learning. Our 
school community embraces a collaborative approach with school staff, students, p
arents and community. Data will 
provide the path to the appropriate interventions and enrichment. Valley View staff will point the way for students to risk, 
grow, and achieve.
 
 
This urban
-
rural community is located in the Antelope Valley approximately 90 m
iles northeast of Los Angeles. The 
community is a very diverse one. Some of the area residents are upwardly mobile, employed in a wide variety of 
professions including aircraft construction and testing, space exploration and related skill areas, agricultur
e, 
transportation and allied people services. Numerous residents commute to the greater Los Angeles area for employment. 
Edwards Air Force Base, Boeing, Lockheed Aircraft Company, and Northrup Grumman are within close proximity. However, 
in many areas of t
he community substantial numbers of families find it difficult to subsist without some sort of public 
assistance. Many of these wage earners are laborers or seasonal workers, earning less than minimum wage. Finding ways 
to effectively address the needs of 
such diversity is just one of the many challenges that the schools of the District must 
address. Founded in 1959, Valley View Elementary is home to 786 students in grades Transitional Kindergarten through 
Sixth. The student body includes 33.7% White, 49.4%
 
Hispanic, 10.7% African American, 4.9% Other. Approximately 62.5% 
of our students are socioeconomically disadvantaged. The mobility of students during the school year is significant. The 
Valley View staff includes 38 certificated and 59 classified personn
el.
 
Our diverse student population is served through several specialized programs including: Title 1, English Language 
Learners, GATE and Special Education. Special Education services include Speech and Language, Resource Specialist 
Program, Three Special 
Day Classes. We have a full
-
time vice principal, counselor, school psychologist. Eligible students 
are able to access School Based Mental Health supports. In June of 2010, Valley View was awarded the California 
Distinguished School Award. Valley View is AV
ID Elementary certified, with AVID implemented school wide. The 
instructional day lasts from 7:45 a.m. to 1:45 for Kindergarten, 1:50 for Grades 1
-
3 and 1:55 p.m. for Grades 4
-
6. After 
school care is provided from 1:50 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. through the City of
 

 
 
Reading, language arts, math, science, and history curriculum, instruction and materials are directly aligned to the 
Common Core State Standards and the district's performance standards. Common Core State Stand
ards
-
based staff 
development opportunities are available. Teachers work with the members of their grade level to develop year
-
long 
pacing plans to ensure that instruction in the core academic areas will address the standards. Pacing plans are reviewed 
quar
terly. Most grade levels meet regularly to review student work and assessment data to ensure that students are 
mastering skills addressed by the content standards. Site administrators receive training on the content standards and 
how to coach, supervise an
d evaluate teachers according to their ability to teach the standards. Staff members continue 
to work in the area of differentiating instruction to meet the needs of all students, particularly those participating in GAT
E, 
ELL and special education. Staff m
embers also continue to work to ensure that the goals and objectives of students 
receiving special education services are aligned with grade level appropriate content standards.
 
Staff members have the opportunity to attend staff development to address the 
alignment of standards, assessed student 
performance, and professional needs. New Teacher Support along with site administration provide support and 
instruction for beginning teachers. School site meeting time is used to analyze data, collaborate, presenta
tion and 
discussion of best practices. Administrative training is offered to administrators and teachers to provide assistance in usin
g 
formal and informal assessment data to guide and inform instruction.

Valley View school staff believe that all students
 
will learn and staff collaborates and analyzes interventions in order to 
provide the support. Students having difficulty meeting grade level expectations are offered many opportunities to 
achieve academic success. Instructional assistants (Title I) work w
ith students in the classroom for supplemental support 
with a focus on reading development with a goal to have all students reading by the end of third grade. Several grade 
levels utilize some form of flexible grouping in their classroom to deliver reading
 
and/or language arts instruction to groups 
of students with similar strengths and challenges. Push
-
in Resource assistance is available for qualified students at all 
grade levels. In addition, since our school offers an intervention program designed to mee
t the needs of students who are 
struggling as well as provide enrichment opportunities for achieving students through RTI and a focus on level one 
interventions and small group support. English Language Learners are clustered by proficiency level within ea
ch grade 
level and both designated and integrated EL support in alignment with the ELD standards is monitored by administration 
and bilingual assistants who support the students in the classroom. Student Success Teams (SSTs) and Child Study Teams 
(CSTs) ar
e convened to address students who are experiencing difficulty accessing the curriculum despite interventions 
by the classroom teacher. SSTs consist of the classroom teacher, parent and the principal. CSTs consist of the classroom 
teacher, parent, the Reso
urce specialist, principal and the school psychologist. Students struggling with reading receive 
additional support through implementation of the FastForWord and Reading Assistant as well as after school enrichment 
programs. Students experiencing difficult
y in math receive additional support through the implementation of programs 
with online interventions as well as targeted interventions for students needing more support.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
incl
udes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. 
Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilitie
s); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

A range of academic and social emotional supports exist for Westside students, many of which are unique to individual 
school sites, tailored to meet the needs of the members of each school community.  Many of these 
supports are provided 
by counselors (district and/or community
-
based), school psychologists, school nurses, specialists in 
Speech/Language/Hearing, adaptive physical education teachers, or behavior specialists.
 
 
Student Study and Child Study Teams assist s
tudents experiencing academic and/or social emotional challenges, those 
with special needs, and with assessing eligibility for placement in special classes and/or recommending specialized services 
as needed. Special services and classes are offered for stu
dents with learning disabilities as well as other students with 
exceptional needs.

Twelve counselors provide a range of support services for Westside students.  Programs and services are developed and 
provided based on student data (such as referrals for 
threatening or self
-
harm behaviors and academic intervention 
letters) and the needs of the school site.  Often these programs build upon the skills and habits of mind that are nurtured 
and developed in Leadership Development through Physical Education (LDT
PE), AVID, and Boys Town.  Examples of 
counseling programs include specific groups for strong
-
willed students, grief groups, groups for students who are 
exhibiting signs and behaviors due to trauma, academic organization groups (addressing academic organiz
ation of 
assignments, goals, and expectations), and community outreach and service clubs such as Student Ambassadors or 
Kindness Club. School counselors are assisted by a cadre of Campus Climate Assistants, highly trained paraprofessionals 
who provide soci
al emotional support and structure for students during more unstructured parts of the school day like 
recess and lunch. Counselors and Educational Service staff members collaborate regularly with community agencies to 
facilitate alignment and coordination 
of resources and supports for students and their families.
 
 
The district continues to collaborate with the Department of Mental Health to coordinate with local mental health 
agencies to provide School Based Mental Health services at all school sites for el
igible students.
 
 
Behavior specialists provide student and staff support for students needing intensive behavior support and/or 
intervention.
 
 
Bilingual paraprofessional support staff provide assistance in the classroom for English Learners. Bilingual assi
stants 
receive ongoing professional development in the areas of strategies to support students learning English within the 
classroom; review of district wide academic programs supporting English Learners; specialized language practice used for 
translation 
during parent/teacher conferences; protocols for English Learner identification; and criteria for student 
reclassification.
 
 
Several programs, designed to build students' emotional intelligence and capacity and to promote positive and proactive 
social deci
sion making, reduce bullying, and build an inclusive culture continue to be implemented districtwide. Two of 
these are BoysTown (implemented in grades Kindergarten through 8) and Leadership Development through Physical 
Education for students in grades 4, 5
, and 6.
 
 
A variety of online mathematics (i.e. Big Brains and ALEKS) and reading intervention (i.e. FastForWord) programs are 
accessible for students.  In addition to being used during the school day, students can also access these programs from 
home.  Th
ese online interventions are site
-
specific.
 
 
A variety of extended learning opportunities like before/after school tutoring and/or lunchtime Learning Lab support were 
offered at all sites.  Learning Labs provide support with homework and opportunities for 
collaborative learning sessions.  
Tutoring may provide review of foundational skills, frontloading of key skills and concepts, and/or homework assistance.  
Five days of intersession support is provided for middle school students during each spring and summ
er intersession.  An 
Extended School Year program is available during the first part of summer intersession for those students with disabilities 
who qualify.  A traditional district wide summer school program was on hold for the summer of 2018 due to signi
ficant 
maintenance and repairs at school sites. In lieu of the summer school program for elementary students, optional 
interactive Summer Learning Kits were purchased for parents and caregivers to use with their students over the summer 
intersession. The K
its contained games, tools, and materials to sharpen and support reading, writing, and math skills.  
Additionally, the district offered its third summer KinderCamp during the summer.  The three
-
day experience was designed 
to provide an opportunity for inco
ming Kindergarteners and their parents to learn about Kindergarten expectations in a 
day camp

type environment.

Westside Union School District offers on

going professional learning and training opportunities for teachers, 
administrators, and para

educators.
 
 
The goal of professional learning is to provide staff 
members the support that they need to meet the diverse educational 
needs of Westside students. The key area of focus for professional development and support for the 2018
-
2019 school 
year was the use of assessment data, particularly common formative assess
ment data, to guide and inform instruction.
 
 
Teachers, classified instructional classroom support staff, and site administrators are provided four days of professional 
development each year. These days are calendared work days.  For all groups, two of the 
days are dedicated to issues and 
needs related specifically to our English Learners, foster youth, or other at
-
risk students.  For teachers and site 
administrators, two of the four days are devoted to building their capacity to use data, particularly forma
tive assessment 
data, to inform instruction.  For classified instructional staff, two days were devoted a to a variety of topics including 
trauma
-
informed support for at
-
risk youth; BoysTown; Leadership Development through Physical Education; and meeting 
t
he academic needs of students with exceptional needs.
 
 
Teachers are also encouraged to engage in optional professional learning opportunities that relate to their specific 
teaching assignment. Teachers are compensated at a contractual hourly rate for their
 
participation in these sessions.
 
 
Similar opportunities are provided for our site administrators.  Most regularly attend applicable ACSA Academies.  70% of

support.  This is especially true in the area of 
integration of classroom technology tools to support teaching and learning.  During the 2018

five years of teaching experience.   The 
district has developed a robust system for new teacher support including 1:1 support, Professional Learning Communities 
(PLCs), and direct classroom support. New teachers are assigned a mentor/coach dependent upon t
heir credential status. 
Support providers, mentors, and coaches in the program are veteran teachers who have been released full
-
time from their 
classroom responsibilities.  Every new teacher is supported weekly at their site by their mentor/coach with the 
focus of 
support being aligned to their goal and individual support plan.  Full time administrators/coaches also support the pre
-
interns and interns based upon the requirements of their university's memorandum of understanding and the 
requirements of the C
TC.  The pre
-
intern and intern teachers participate in biweekly professional development based 
upon the district initiatives as well as their unique developmental needs.  Teachers holding a Preliminary credential are 
supported by teachers on special assign
ment who serve as full time Support Providers.  Those holding a Preliminary 
credential attend a series of six professional development opportunities specially designed and aligned with the California 
Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTPs). For veter
an teachers needing additional support, the Peer Assistance and 
Review (PAR) program is designed to improve the education of students by providing opportunities for additional training 
for all teachers.
