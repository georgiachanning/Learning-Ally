School Description
 
Aviara Oaks Elementary School (AOES) is located in the southern part of the City of 
Carlsbad within 
the boundaries of the Carlsbad Unified School District (CUSD).   The campus sits on 19
-
acres of land 
which makes for a park
-
like setting with plenty of open spaces.   It opened its doors in September 
of 1990 with 350 students in kindergarte
n through sixth grade and now holds 689 in grades 
kindergarten through fifth.
 
 
Aviara Oaks Elementary School is built on partnerships which directly impact student learning.   
AOES has strong ties to its local community.   It is the connections between sta
ff, families, students, 
and local businesses which make AOES the successful school it has become.  The AOES family is 
committed to facilitating and encouraging students to be lifelong learners, with good character, 
who are able to collaborate and communica
te with others, and grow to be productive, successful 
citizens of their communities.
 
 
The AOES educational program serves students with a diverse background and of all ability levels.  
Staff facilitates deeper levels of understanding through the use of que
stioning, investigations, 
discussions, and technology.  AOES is an AVID school which promotes academic success, self
-
efficacy, and self
-
advocacy through structured note taking, writing across the curriculum, 
organization, and study skills. Currently staffe
d with 24 K
-
5 classrooms, we offer special education 
and intervention support services via 2 Learning Centers and Education Specialists, a  Speech and 
Language specialist, an ELD specialist for language acquisition for English Language Learners, and 
tutori
ng in both math and reading 3 times weekly for students struggling with base concepts and 
skills. Additionally, weekly specials are provided to students in music, science, pe, and computer 
literacy. Challenge opportunities exist for our advancing learners 
through grade level appropriate 
extension activities, usually project based.
 
 
We have an active PTA and parent community who are integrally involved in both the financial and 
academic support of our educational program. Parent and community volunteers 
support and 
enhance instruction, provide assistance with special programs
-
 
i.e. Running Club, Robotics, Meet 
the Masters, Everyone A Reader, Spelling Bee and School Garden, and participate in monthly school 
wide activities to build community. They are memb
ers of School Site Council, Carlsbad Education 
Foundation, PTA, CUSD Parent Advisory Council, Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce Education 
Committee, and many other community groups which support the students and staff at AOE.
 
On behalf of the students and staff
 
at AOE, we thank you for your interest.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Types of Services Funded
 
The District believes in "Best First Instruction," which means each teacher 
is accountable for the learning needs of the students in their class
, teachers 
differentiate based on these learning needs and they collaborate with 
grade level team teachers as well as the principal to ensure students 
progress at every level.  Beyond the general education classroom, schools 
have Learning Center support, a
nd depending upon the site, Special Day 
Classrooms, Guide counseling, and School Counselors.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataque

that contains additional information 
about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports 
for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduate
s, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are 
publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet
 
at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first

served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, 
the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending on 
availability), the types of software pr
ograms available on a workstation, 
and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety 
Plan
 
We revise and update our school safety plan each year in the fall. Our 
current school safety plan meets all federal, state, and district standards 
for a comprehensive school safety plan. It addresses prevention, planning, 
responding, and recovering fr
om possible threats (earthquakes, intruders,  
fires) to ensure the safety of students, staff, and visitors. Our counselors, 
psychologists, and site administrators are extensively trained in threat 
assessment techniques by nationally recognized experts in s
chool
-
threat 
assessment. To ensure safety on our campus, a school site safety 
committee conducts inspections to identify potential hazards. We have 
also developed a disaster preparedness plan, and we conduct regular fire 
and earthquake drills to familiariz
e staff and students with emergency 
procedures. Our school site is also monitored for physical safety. Play 

high standard for student safety and undergo regular inspections. A new 
visi
tor check
-
in system is being implemented, requiring all visitors to sign 
in and out.
