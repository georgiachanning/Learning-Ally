By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Robert Gisler Elementary School is a TK
-
5 elementary school serving approximately 535 students.  Gisler School is located 
in the Fountain Valley School District in Orange County. Gisler students represent a cross
-
section of cultural, racial and 
ethnic backgrounds, displaying various levels of abilities from gifted to at
-
risk. All students receive core curriculum 
instruction as identified by the Fountain Valley School District and California State Standards. Teachers work 
collaboratively to design
 
an instructional program to meet the specific needs of students using research
-
based 
instructional practices, strategies, and techniques. Gisler is committed to every student reaching a level of proficient 
performance in order to prepare him/her for the f
uture. Strong parent involvement is evident and supports the vital 
partnership between home and school. Teachers, staff, and administrators continue to act on the belief that students 
come first.  The educational programs at Gisler are tailored to meet the
 
needs of an ever
-
changing school population.
 
 
Our school's theme and goal for the 2019
-
2020 school year is "Learning Today, Leading Tomorrow".  This theme is applied 
throughout the day in all aspects of our students education.  The success of Gisler Eleme
ntary School depends on the 
commitment of all staff (administrators, teachers, and support staff) to high
-
quality standards, expectations, and 
performances. Gisler school is dedicated to ensuring the academic success of all students, providing a comprehens
ive 
educational experience that is the foundation of future endeavors.  We believe all students can learn and are each a valued 
individual with unique physical, social, emotional, and intellectual needs.
 
 
Professional development is an integral part of our
 
ongoing plan for continuous improvement; curriculum development, 
the design of instructional activities, and the use of assessment measures are focused on providing learning opportunities 
and feedback systems that enable students to achieve success and te
achers to continue perfecting their practices in order 
to provide the best educational program for students.
 
 
Effective collaboration and communication with families as partners in the education of their children are essential to the 
success of Gisler Elem
entary School.  Parents are welcomed and encouraged to participate in their child's lives by joining 
PTO, School Site Council, and classroom volunteers.  Weekly communication by the principal builds strong communication 
with the school.  In weekly communic
ation, parents are informed of upcoming events, student celebrations, and academic 
focuses.

Maintenance & Repai
r:
 

complex maintenance functions occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is 
administered by the Foun
tain Valley School District's Maintenance & Operations department to ensure that school 
grounds and facilities remain in excellent repair. A work order process is used when issues arise that require immediate 
attention. Emergency repairs are given the high
est priority; repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order in 
which they are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
Deferred maintenance includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting
, and floor systems. Fountain Valley School District did not participate in the State School Deferred Maintenance 
Budget Program. Fountain Valley School District sets aside funds each year to specifically address deferred maintenance 
needs. The passing of 
Measure O provided additional, much
-
needed funds for these types of projects.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Gisler School. Students are supervised before/after school, during 
lunch and recess periods, by teachers, administrators, trained aides, and classified staf
f.  All visitors to the campus must 
sign in using the Raptor Visitor Management System in the main office.  Once signed in all visitors must wear the printed 
badge from Raptor while on school grounds. Beginning January 1, 2020, all parent volunteers that w
ork with students five 
hours or more during the week must have a DOJ clearance and fingerprints.
 
 
The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake 
standards. The Safety Committee revie
ws and updates the Safe School Action Plan each year by March 1st. Any and all 
revisions to the plan are immediately communicated to classified and certificated staff.

The Goals and Objectives in the Safe School Action Plan focus on three areas:
 
1)
 
A 
school climate characterized by caring and connected
-
ness,
 
2)
 
The safe and orderly physical environment of the school, and
 
3)
 
The health and wellness of students.
 
 
To supplement the Safe School Action Plan, every school also has a disaster preparedness plan that
 
includes steps for 
ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire, disaster, and lock
-
down drills are conducted on a rotating basis 
throughout the school year.  Gisler staff participated in professional development related to safety during the 
2019
-
20 
school year.  All staff received training on Titan HST Emergency Communication system and Stop the Bleed.
