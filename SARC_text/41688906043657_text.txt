Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
For over fifty
-
five years, Kings Mountain Elementary School has provided quality education in an intimate setting. It serves 
approximately sixty to seventy children in kindergarten through 5t
h grade from the Kings Mountain and Coastside 
communities. Its small size allows teachers and staff to know each child and respond to their diverse educational needs. 
Teachers and staff  remain connected and involved in all students' education as they prog
ress through Kings Mountain 
School. Multi
-
aged groups are taught in all classrooms. In addition, para professionals and parent volunteers partner with 
teachers to focus on different academic subjects and grade levels. Library time is integrated into the we
ekly schedule, as 
well as art, science, music and physical education, which are taught by specialists through a combination of district and 
parent funding. On the playground, children of all ages play together, supervised and partnering with staff to creat
e an 
inclusive and responsive social experience.
 
 
Mission Statement:
 
We are here to foster the development of creative, courageous, compassionate human beings who are committed to 
realizing their full potential, while supporting others to do the same.
 
 
We will provide a safe and nurturing learning environment where each student receives an appropriate academically 
challenging curriculum; develops a sense of personal responsibility; respects all others and practices good citizenship.
 
 
We will promote a po
werful cohesive partnership that actively involves students, parents, teachers, other school 
personnel, and the community in accomplishing our mission.
 
 
Student Outcomes:
 
Students will acquire and develop the basic skills and knowledge necessary to 
function independently and to pursue 
individual learning and interests.
 
 
Students will develop a sense of self
-
worth, will learn to value and respect others, and will be able to communicate 
effectively with adults and with one another.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic
al education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019

Kings Mountain School benefits immensely from its supportive family community. 
 
 
Our family volunteers participate in classroom activities, chaperone field trips, manage our school library, and a host of 
other opportunities through 
participation in our Parent Organization. KMES has two highly collaborative organizations: 1) 

Parents (KMAP): provides money for impr
ovements that cannot be supported by statewide education budget. Currently, 
KMAP funds more than 25% of the school budget.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School Safety Plan Overview
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern at Kings Mountain Elementary School. Our school safety plan is an ongoing 
process involving staff, parents, and 
local emergency professionals. The school is in compliance with laws, rules, and 
regulations pertaining to emergency standards. The plan is updated  and reviewed with staff annually. The committee 
meets as needed to review and modify safety procedures and 

preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster.  The key elements in the plan 
include emergency procedures for a wide variety of events, such as fire, ear
thquake, outdoor environment hazards, 
imminent threat of violence or gunfire, as well as evacuation procedures. The plan includes an Incident Command System 
(ICS), and communication protocols. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a monthly basis throu
ghout the school year. 
The plan also addresses school discipline rules and procedures. The plan is comprehensive and includes all school 
functions, including the after
-
school daycare and any evening events. Students are supervised before and during school 
by certificated staff, classified staff, and the principal. There is a designated area for student drop off and pick up. Visi

Kings Mountain Elementary School is dedicated to professional growth and development in support of our students 
academic, social and emotional success as 21st century learners. All classroom teachers participate in district staff 
development. Staff members
 
build teaching skills and concepts by participating in district, county, and state workshops 
throughout the year. In turn, they share their experiences and knowledge with their colleagues in regularly scheduled site 
meetings.  Focus areas are aligned with
 
the District Local Control Accountability Plan and the site's School Plan for Student 
Achievement. The focus of site staff training/development this year is Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports, and 
Social Emotional learning.  Credentialed staff
 
received training on Multitiered systems of support, PBIS, and continue to 
work with a PBIS coach developing Tier 1, classroom supports.
 
 
All teachers are members of KMES Leadership Team that meets monthly for an hour to reflect on student learning data, 
share new and best teachers' practices in classrooms, troubleshoot areas of weakness. Monthly data meetings are used 
to reflect and target student needs and work on classroom practices that support student engagement and progress for 
all.  Student achievem
ent data in conjunction with classroom assessments direct focus of professional development.
