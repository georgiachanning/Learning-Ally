By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 

condition. The overall summary of facility conditions uses ratings of exemplary, 
good, fair or poor.
 
 
The Williams Facility Inspection took place in August 2019. We received an overall rating of GOOD in all areas, with a score 
of 98.26% .  The report mentioned a wet fire extinguisher inspection tag was found to be out of date, that som
e classrooms 
contained bookcases or file cabinets not secured to the walls, a leaking sink faucet was found, and two classrooms had an 
extension cord plugged into a power strip.  All of these specific instances noted in the report have been corrected.
 
 
The report states that Dana Gray Elementary is a "very attractive and well maintained school."  Multiple improvements 
have been made to Dana Gray Elementary to maintain our school site in recent years. In the 2017
-
2018 school year, all 
classrooms at Dana G
ray were upgraded to include short throw video projectors and screens.  With funds from the 
California Clean Energy Jobs Act (Prop. 39), all of the light bulbs and fixtures at Dana Gray Elementary were replaced at 
the during the 2016
-
2017 school year.  In 
2011
-
2012 solar panels were put into place that complemented the architectural 
structure of the school.  Additionally, larger facility physical improvements were completed at Dana Gray as recently as 
the 2010
-
11 school year.  These included the floors, wal
ls, restrooms, and painting of the outside building. At that time, 
many classrooms were also supplied with new desks and chairs.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
One of our primary concerns as a school is to protect the students in the event of a crisis. We have monthly drills that 
adhere with our School Safety Plan. The School Safety Plan is reviewed with staff on a regular basis.  We have ensured 
that every room on our school site is outfitted with the School Safety Plan and an emergency back pack that has first aid 
supplies. In addition, we keep updated records of our students and their emergency contacts, as well as updated records 
of both our sc
hool staff and district staff. As a part of our safety plan, we include monthly practice drills for fire, earthquake, 
and/or lock down situations.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
The 2013

14 California Department of 
Education (CDE) budget package replaces the previous K

12 finance system with a 
new Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF). For school districts and charter schools, the LCFF creates base, supplemental, 
and concentration grants in place of most previously ex
isting K

12 funding streams, including revenue limits and most 
state categorical programs. For county offices of education (COEs), the LCFF creates separate funding streams for oversight 
activities and instructional programs.
 
 
The goal of the LCFF is to sig
nificantly simplify how state funding is provided to local educational agencies (LEAs). Under 
the new funding system, revenue limits and most state categorical programs are eliminated. LEAs will receive funding 
based on the demographic profile of the stude
nts they serve and gain greater flexibility to use these funds to improve 
outcomes of students. The LCFF creates funding targets based on these student characteristics. The Local Control 
Accountability Plan (LCAP) is an important component of the LCFF.
 
 
Und
er the LCFF all districts are required to prepare an LCAP, which describes how they intend to meet annual goals for all 
pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities identified pursuant to EC Section 52060(d). Each schoo
l 
district 
must engage parents, educators, employees and the community to establish these plans. Parental and community 
engagement of all stakeholders is critical to the development of the district LCAP. FBUSD continues to work with all 
stakeholder groups in holding 
various district and school committee meeting and forums designed to gather information 

goals and specific actions the district will 
take to achieve the vision and goals.
 
 

budget will help achieve the goals, and assess each year how well the strategies in the plan w
ere able to improve 
outcomes.
 
 
FBUSD is pleased to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program. Depending on 
the type of categorical funding a site may receive, District or school parent councils and committees are r
equired under 
certain requirements and guidelines. Such advisory committees in the FBUSD include the following:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
Site Level English Learner Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee (DAC)
 

 
District English Learner Advisor
y Committee (DELAC)

This section provides information on the annual number of school days dedicated to staff development for the most recent 
three
-
year 
period.
 
 
District wide teachers and administrators are given two of professional development in the beginning of the year. The 
individual site then gives an additional day of professional development (PD) in the beginning of the year and plans further 
PD o
nce a month during minimum days that are one to two hours long. In addition, throughout the year there are two 
staff meetings per month (one hour long). Many of these meeting focus on areas of professional development developed 
through the staff analysis o
f student academic and behavioral performance data.  We also allocate funding for professional 
development to occur during the year. This year we have added a teacher on special assignment (TOSA) to assist with the 
individual mentoring and the coaching of 
teaching staff. These professional development days assist with the continued 
focus on the implementation of Common Core State Standards.
