By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Lincoln Elementary School is a designated Historic Point of Interest constructed in 1936 located in the Northwest section 
of Pomona. The school is a source of community pride serving a diverse and growing student population of appro
ximately 
400 students in grades pre
-
K to 6.
 
 
Lincoln maintains 17 classrooms, a library, a cafeteria, an auditorium, and one multi media labs. Each classroom and the 
multi media lab are wired with Internet access, Smart Board/Viewsonic technology and/or ch
rome books, ipads. Lincoln 
is a 1:1 school where every student, from kinder through sixth grade, has their own chromebooks.  All students grades 3 
-
 
6 are also able to take home their chromebook in order to access student work, via technology, from home.  
Technology 
is used as a tool to enhance and support the academic achievement of all students. Academic programs are used to guide 
instruction and increase the educational development of students. Programs include Systematic English Language 
Development, Gu
ided Reading, Thinking Maps, Write from the Beginning, Accelerated Reader, Imagine Learning and a 
variety of other software programs are used to promote student achievement.
 
 
Lincoln serves as a feeder school for two Head Start programs that are now housed
 
at Lincoln. We take an active role in 
providing an effective transition for parents with children entering the school. Parents are provided with opportunities to 
attend workshops/trainings to acquire information regarding academic and instructional progra
ms and are invited to 
attend the spring Open House event on campus.
 
 
Vision and Mission
 
It is our vision at Lincoln Elementary School that all members of the school community will work collaboratively to provide 
each student the skills necessary to 
successfully participate in and contribute to a culturally diverse, global society. At 
Lincoln, students are expected to be socially responsible, self
-
motivated life long learners.
 
 
It is our mission to serve a diverse student population, recognizing indiv
idual needs and having every member of the school 
experience success in an atmosphere that promotes security, warmth, mutual respect and caring. The collaboration of 
teachers, parents and students provides the highest quality instruction and guides instruc
tion to meet the individual needs 
of all students. All students including GATE, English Learners, economically disadvantaged, Hispanic students and students 
with disabilities are expected to meet or exceed state and District standards in all curricular are
as.
 
 
Message from the Principal
 
Proposition 98, also known as The Classroom Instructional Impr
ovement and Accountability Act, approved by California 

public schools with a stable source of funding. In return, all public schools in 
the State of California are required annually 
to prepare a School Accountability Report Card and disseminate it to the public. The purpose of the accountability report 
card is to provide the public with important information about each school and to commun

achieving its goals. As you read our report card, I am sure you will get a clear picture of a school that is dedicated to 
improvement, a highly qualified staff that is professionally and personally committed to meeting the ne
eds of all students 
and a student body that takes pride in their educational successes. We are proud to be the Lincoln bulldogs!

As a school 
community, we take pride in promoting collaboration of all school community members as a means of creating 
a positive influence in the academic/social growth of our students. As a learning community, we encourage parents to 
volunteer their time in classroo
ms and also encourage active participation in the following site meetings/gatherings: 
School Site Council (SSC), School Advisory Committee (SAC), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) and Parent 
Teacher Association (PTA) meetings.
 
 
Our current PTA is 
very active in hosting family nights, student activities, School Smarts Academy for parents, etc. as well 
as fund raising to support school wide activities.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The safety of the students and staff is a primary concern of the Pomona Unified School District. All schools in the District 
are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials
. A current disaster preparedness 
plan is in place for earthquakes and emergency evacuations. To ensure the effectiveness of our disaster plans, we conduct 
monthly fire drills, surprise lock
-
down drills and twice a year earthquake disaster drills to ensure
 
maximum safety of the 
school community during the school day. All buildings within the District are in compliance with state earthquake 
standards.
 
 
A Safe School Plan has been reviewed, updated, discussed and site practice drills where conducted in order 
to make sure 
the site plan is effective throughout September and October of 2018.  Final approval by the faculty occurred on October 
10, 2018. It includes policies and procedures for disaster preparedness, student discipline, the components of a safe and 
o
rderly school environment, before and after school supervision, suspension/expulsion procedures, safety, child abuse 
reporting procedures, student dress codes, and student and staff sexual harassment training and procedures. A discipline 
policy may be foun
d at each school that seeks to insure a safe and orderly environment for students and staff.
 
 
To maximize our efforts in providing a safe campus, the Lincoln staff, including administration, teachers, office staff, 
custodian, and campus supervisors limit a
nd control unauthorized access of school grounds during the school day. All
