By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement
 
(Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achi
evement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entranc
e to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students t

s tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calc

scores.

The School Site Council or the Site Safety Committee is responsible for the development and updating of the school's 
Comprehensive Safety Plan. A Site Comprehensive Safety Plan Checklist is provided by the Pupil S
ervices Department to 
give guidance on what should be included in the School's Safety Plan. The Safety Plan is discussed with staff, evaluated, 
amended/reviewed/updated by January 31 of each year. The school's safety committee makes monthly safety inspecti
ons. 
A school Disaster Preparedness Plan that deals with a wide variety of emergency situations is incorporated into the School 
Safety Plan.  Earthquakes, fire, lockdown, and active shooter/intruder drills are conducted as required. The key elements 
of the
 
Comprehensive School Safety Plan include an assessment of current status of school crime; provisions of any 
schoolwide dress code including the definition of "gang related apparel"; safe movement of pupils, parents and school 
employees to and from school;
 
strategies in maintaining a safe and orderly school environment; visitors on campus; child 
abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to suspensions, expulsion or 
mandatory expulsion and other school designate
d serious acts which would lead to suspension or expulsion, notification 
to teachers, anti
-
bullying policy, discrimination/harassment, and school discipline rules and procedures pursuant to EC 
35291 and EC 35291.5. The school also has an assigned School Re

June of 2018, a group of teachers attended the 3

Day AVID Summer Institute. Our school
-
wide commitment of 
AVID implementation addresses our students' needs of organization skills, extracting and organizing content 
derived from text and lecture via 2
-
3 colu
mn notes, and AVID strategies to increase collaborative opportunities.
 

 
Teachers were released 1/2 day to receive PD on AVID Note
-
taking, Close Reading Strategy, and Student 
Engagement. After SBAC data analysis, it was determined that these three components
 
would help increase 
student achievement.
 

 
Teachers were released 1/2 day to analyze student achievement data and plan their instruction. Teachers 
analyzed DIBELS data, district writing scores, and MAC tests.
 

 
Staff meeting on Close Reading Strategy. One of 
the school's three instructional commitments that strengthens 
analytical reading skills. This directly supports Claim 1 on the SBAC.

August 2017, training on "Restorative Language" and "Mindfull
ness" presented by SAP Counselor and Principal. 
Taft's suspension rate is high (even though it decreased from the previous year), so the staff received training 
to strengthen relationships with students.

Student achievement data indicates that efforts wil
l be made to decrease the suspension rate. Data also indicates the 
need to decrease the distance from standard as measured on the SBAC mathematics assessment. After increasing student 
achievement in ELA the prior year, there was a slight decrease on the SB
AC ELA assessment (
-
1 point from standard). 
District assessments (Acadience) and state assessments (SBAC and ELPAC) indicate there is an achievement gap between 
student subgroups (poverty, Hispanic, African
-
American, Special Education) and ALL students. Ba
sed on this data, staff 
professional development will include the following:

year. First staff meeting in the August was focused on the 
importance of site practices that promote equity for our students 
of poverty, English Learners, minorities, and 
Special Education.
 

 
Classroom teachers will be provided release time to analyze student achievement data to inform instruction.
 

 
Staff will receive training on how to positively address challenging student behavi
ors as the school is in its first 
year of PBIS implementation.
 

 
All teachers will receive training on multiple Danielson Framework Modules throughout the year.
 

 
Select teachers will be trained on Restorative Practices.
 

 
Select teachers will be trained on AVID
.
 

 
All teachers will receive training on effective pedagogy when teaching students how to solve mathematical word 
problems.
 
Site identified training opportunities are provided during the instructional day as well as after school depending on staff 
needs and
 
the availability of training. Follow up, support, and monitoring are provided to ensure application of training 
received and alignment with student learning needs and site goals. There are 13 staff meetings scheduled, 15 team 
meetings, and weekly professi
onal learning community time.
