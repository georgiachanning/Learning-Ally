Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilitie
s); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

al development. A variety of parent classes 
were held on site, including 10 Educational Commandments and Parent Leadership through PLI and Parenting Partners.  
The PTA is actively involved in supporting programs to enhance learning for the Olive Street stu

Teacher compacts signed by every student, teacher, and parent.   Olive Street School also offers the assistance of 
our FACES to assist with parent outreach and translating.  Support for parent outreach is provided through T
itle I funding, 
which allows us to set aside at least one
-
percent for that purpose. Parents also participate in two parent leadership 
programs. One is Parent Leadership Institute and the other is Parenting Partners as discussed earlier.
 
 
Olive Street is 
co
mmitted to providing authentic leadership opportunities through engaging parents in decisions that impact our 
school.
 
 
In addition, we look for ways to provide education and training for parents though learning walks and coffee chats 
(Mathematics, English 
Language Arts, ELD, Social Emotional Learning, and various programs such as Accelerated Reader 
and Lexia Phonics). In addition, parents have the opportunity to learn and play healthy activities during lunch recess 
through the Padres en Acción program. Padr
es en Acción provides nutition classes and meetings for parents.

The vision of AESD is to
 
create an exceptional learning environment that engages, challenges, and supports all students 
so that they thrive and achieve their academic potential every year, while preparing them to pursue college and career 
opportunities to 
become competitive global citizens.
 
 
The vision for e²STEAM
-
D (equitable and engaging science,

empower school communities to integrate sci
ence, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics, and Dual Language 
Immersion through the process of critical thinking, communication, creativity, and collaboration to foster innovation not 
just for today, but the future.
 
 
Core Strategy:
  
In order to 
increase the achievement of all students and close the achievement gap, all professionals will 
build meaningful student relationships and collaborate in data
-
informed learning communities to ensure the engagement 
of all students in a rigorous curriculum.
 
 
Professional Learning is offered in a variety of flexible formats and structures to meet the diverse professional and

provided with on site specific professional development as needed through district curriculum specialist and off site 
conference attendance.
 
 
Job emb
edded professional learning is provided by a site instructional coach and/or facilitated 
through both peer learning opportunities. All schools have a full time instructional coach who facilitate a student centered 
coaching framework and maximize individual
ized professional learning for teachers through lesson studies, co
-
planning/teaching, PLCs, peer learning walks and provide professional learning.
 
 
Professional Learning areas of focused are identified through analysis of both formative and summative data.
 
 
All 
unduplicated student groups ELA and Math summative data as reported by summative and interim CAASPP test items 
indicate a gap of achievement from the standard met indicator.
 
 
To meet these identified students needs the following professional learning
 
has transpired:
