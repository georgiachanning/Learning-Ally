Principal's Message
 
 
In accordance with Proposition 98, every school in California is required to issue an annual 
Accountability Report Card. As the principal of Roosevelt Elementary, I welcome this opportunity 
to share this information with you. Roosevelt Elementary has an on
going tradition of placing a 
priority on student success. Our school population consists of students and staff with rich 
multicultural and ethnically diverse backgrounds. Our students, parents, staff, and community 
members join together to assure that all 
students succeed.
 
 
Each student has special talents and is given the opportunity to develop these talents at Roosevelt. 

intellectual needs are recognized, nurture
d and supported. Roosevelt Elementary is dedicated to 
using a challenging curriculum to ensure that all students have the opportunity to achieve at high 
levels. The mission of Roosevelt Elementary School is to guarantee equity and access to meaningful 
lear
ning experiences that prepare every student for success in middle school and beyond, enabling 
each student to function as a responsible citizen in a global society.
 
 
Roosevelt Elementary offers comprehensive instructional programs, which underscore the val
ue of 
living in a multicultural society. Students are taught to think critically, to take pride in their heritage, 
and to value the thoughts, beliefs, and contributions of many cultures. Roosevelt Elementary will 
respond to the needs of all students. Throu
gh the collaboration of school personnel and parents, 
Roosevelt will offer an essential education, using strategies that allow students to develop their 
capacities and skills so that they may achieve their full potential in a competitive society.
 
 
There is
 
a variety of opportunities available to each student at Roosevelt Elementary, including 
opportunities to participate in district

level competitions for oratorical recitations, mathematics 
performance, dance and music performance, and spelling performance.
 
Sixth grade students may 
also participate as members of the Roosevelt Elementary Student Council.
 
 
Adolfo Rodas, PRINCIPAL

award for the consistency and fi
delity that the team has demonstrated in promoting and encouraging a positive culture with 
students.
 
 
FOCUS FOR IMPROVEMENT
 

 
Meet SMART targets (ELA 31%; MATH 25%), and focus on monitoring student achievement. We will provide quality instruction 
to all stud
ents, and strive to make gains in English and Math.
 

 
Focus school improvement planning solely on increasing student achievement. Our efforts and resources are focused towards 
the most pressing student academic needs as shown by the data
-
driven needs assessm
ent. The school improvement plan 
includes measurable long
-
term goals and short term objectives as well as aligned strategies, activities, milestones, 
professional development plans, and budgets.
 

 
Each part of the school improvement planning process has been
 
carefully aligned with components of instruction and 
assessment so that evidence of student learning is our priority. Strategies and activities are clearly differentiated. We wil
l 
focus on improving daily instruction. During our Professional Learning Comm
unities, the focus is on interpreting the data, 
giving meaning to it, and identifying root causes.. Staff share knowledge gained from professional development activities. We
 
also discuss student mastery of standards, other outcomes, and possible interventi
on strategies based on student needs.
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which de
scribes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information a
bout SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members 
should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Roosevelt Elementary School is among the oldest of the schools in Lynwood and has 
served the community for many years. Several students have parents 
and grandparents who attended Roosevelt.
 
 
Over the years, Roosevelt has been remodeled and has experienced new construction. During the summer of 2003, the main office
 
was modernized, and 
a
 
fence was installed to surround the area, for safety purposes. In January of 2005, an additional, two
-
story building was completed on the north side of 
the campus.
 
 
In the 2006 

 
2007 school year, several portable buildings were removed from the campus. D
uring the 2007 

 
2008 school year, a teacher parking lot 
was constructed on site from which the portables had been removed. During the same year, an electronic marquee was mounted on
 
the wall outside of 
the main office. During the last quarter of the 2008 

 
2009 school year, two wings containing rooms 6 

 
11 and rooms 12 

 
17 received new roofs. One 
classroom received all new flooring during the 2009 

 
2010 school year; the process included asbestos abatement. Major improvements which occurred 
from 2011
-
201
2 were built. There was a need for an updated play area with approval of a state
-
of
-
the
-


-
2013 facilities were upgrade
d with school
-
wide painting, 
and new landscaping throughout our entire school campus. Additional school facilities improvements taking place in 2015
-
2016 with the renovation and 
replacement of open hard surface play areas.
 
 
All facilities at Roosevelt Elem
entary are maintained by a full
-
time custodian during the regular school day. Two night custodians clean and prepare the 
classrooms, restrooms and other buildings for the daily operations of each school day.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school bu
ildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical sys
tems, heating and vent
ilation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good
 
repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make thos
e repairs. The guidelines for this assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the si

Tool used for the assessment on the Web sit

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Oth
er local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The safety of all students and staff is our top priority for Roosevelt Elementary. Gates surrounding the school campus are lo
cked and secured during 
school hours. The site administrators, teache
rs, staff, and parent volunteers regularly monitor the campus throughout the school day. Students are 
supervised at all times, with additional staff overseeing safety during morning recess and lunch. After school, teachers esco
rt their classes to the front
 
of 
the school for dismissal. Transitional Kindergarten and Kindergarten students are released only to parents or caregivers in a
 
specified location. Parents 
are required to provide photo identification when removing students early from school.
 
 
The 
school welcomes parents and community members as visitors on campus. To ensure safety, all visitors must sign in at the schoo
l office and wear 
identification badges throughout the duration of their stay.
 
 
The school safety plan is revised every spring by t
he School Safety Committee. Revisions to the plan are shared immediately with all members of the 
staff. The key elements outlined within the plan include: 1) child abuse reporting procedures; 2) teacher notification of dan
gerous pupils procedures; 3) 
disas
ter response procedures; 4) procedures for safe entrance and exit from school; 5) sexual harassment policy: 6) suspension and
 
expulsion policies; 
7) dress code; and 8) discipline policies. The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations p
ertaining to hazardous materials and state 

 
disaster. Fire, earthquake, 
and lock
-
 
down drills are conducted on a regular basis thro
ughout the school year.
 
 
We have prepared the Plan & Procedure for Crisis Management/Prevention. It was designed to provide a framework for the school
 
to execute its 
emergency functions and assist the staff in following the procedure with the greatest poss
ible speed and safety. Regardless of the prescribed procedures, 
training, and instruction, we acknowledge that the sound judgment of the administration and staff is an integral part of safe
ty management.
