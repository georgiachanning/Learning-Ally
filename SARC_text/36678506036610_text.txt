About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to 
publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to pre
pare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consis
tent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more informatio
n about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school prin
cipal or the 
district office.

A constructive evaluation process promotes quality instruction and is a 
fundamental element in a sound educational program. Evaluations and formal 

 
Temporary and 
probationary teachers are evaluated twice
 
a year and tenured teachers are evaluated every other year.
 
 
Evaluations are conducted by the principal, who has been trained and certified for competency to perform teacher evaluations.
 
Evaluations are based 


and Organizing Subject Matter for Student Learning; Assessing Student Learning; Creating and Maintaining Effective Environmen

Due to the state fiscal crisis, additional funding from the State of California that would provide an opportunity to offer di

worked within the state 
fiscal crisis to provide an alternative plan of action for staff development, and has establis

school day with substitutes 
provided, after school, on
