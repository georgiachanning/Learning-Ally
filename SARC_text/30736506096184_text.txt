By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Deerfield Elementary is a TK
-
6 neighborhood school in the heart of Irvine, California. We are extremely proud to have
 
been selected as an outstanding elementary school by the State Department of Education receiving the California 
Distinguished School Award in 2006, 2012 and 2018 .  Deerfield has also been awarded the prestigious federal No Child 
Left Behind National Blue
 
Ribbon Award in the fall of 2007. Serving students since 1976 when Irvine was still steeped in 
its agricultural past, Deerfield has evolved into a unique educational experience that successfully achieves a top
-
quality 
education while addressing the challe
nges and benefits of teaching a substantial number of recent
-
immigrant students.  

 
nations.  Gather all Deerfield families together
 
in one place and you'll hear 32 different languages spoken.
 
 
Our Mission is that Deerfield students will attain high levels of achievement within a safe school environment that is 
staffed by highly
-
qualified individuals. Our vision is to foster success th
rough meeting the academic needs of students with 
regard to individual learning styles and instructional levels.  All students engage in a thinking, meaning
-
centered 
curriculum that is challenging, engaging, and meaningful for students. We focus on the Com
mon Core Standards and 
enrich the curriculum through depth, complexity, and differentiation to ensure each student reaches his or her full 
potential.
 
 

ularly impressive 

and art provide students with the foundations for lifelong enjoyment, involvement, and leadership. Student artwork 
adorns the corridor walls, and the vibrant, high
-
circulation library and state
-
of
-
the
-
art computer lab are nestled in the 
center of the school, incorporating the rich traditions of the past while fostering a vision of the future in child education
. 
Within 
the past two years we have also received grant funding to build a traditional garden as well as an aquaponics 
garden that provide active learning opportunities for our students. Additionally,  the use of technology as an instructional 
tool permeates every 
aspect of the school. All students, TK
-
6, enjoy our two computer labs where, on a weekly basis, our 
media technician and classroom teachers work collaboratively to teach word processing, research, technology 
presentation, and problem solving skills. Additi
onally, teachers regularly utilize chromebooks for authentic integration of 
technology during classroom lessons. Technology is used to deepen the curriculum and access information outside of 
class.
 
 
A focus on the development of character and leadership tr
aits is also a strong focus at Deerfield.  Our Positive Behavior 
Interventions and Support System (PBIS) focuses on the "Falcon Five" traits of exhibiting kind, safe, focused, respectful 
and responsible behavior.  Students are explicitly taught expectation
s for exhibiting these behaviors throughout the 
campus and are recognized for positive behavior.  Our 5th and 6th grade students also have the opportunity to serve on 
Deerfield's "Flock Together" team where we focus on developing servant leadership through
 
participation in spirit, service, 
library and Green Team committees.

While 40% of the student population comes from families where English is not the home language, Deerfield continues to 
produce standardized test scores above the state, county and even 
district averages. The school's Alternative Program for 
Academically Accelerated Students (APAAS) currently includes students formerly identified as Title I and English Learners.  
A well
-
rounded education encompassing academics, physical education, art les
sons, vocal and instrumental music 
education,  civic duties and service learning allows each student to find his or her strengths in a "safe to try" environment
.  
Programs available to assist individual needs include our Multi
-
Tiered System of Support for 
Students,   Title I, Gifted and 
Talented Education (GATE), Positive Behavioral Intervention and Support (PBIS) school wide behavioral support systems,  
a Speech/Language Program, and a Specialized Academic Instruction Program (SAI).
 
 
We believe that commun
ication between parents, students, and teachers is a continuous process and we strive to 
communicate clearly, effectively and in a timely manner. Indeed, involvement between the parent, student, and teacher 
is vital to the learning process of each child.  
We encourage parents to be involved with their children and with us in 
determining the goals for our school and in evaluating student progress.  We appreciate parents helping students acquire 
good study habits and social responsibility.
 
 
At Deerfield we re
cognize the changing nature of education and society, and we can witness a way of life where "diversity" 
evolves into a word with positive connotations.  One can discover how seeing to an individual's needs and acting upon the 
premise that all children are
 
capable produces astounding results
--
even when that individual doesn't initially speak the 
same language or have access to all of the advantages society has to offer.
 
 
Every student who graduates from Deerfield Elementary is prepared to meet the increasin
gly multicultural, ever
-
changing 
world.  The Deerfield family takes tremendous pride in allowing its children to start their lives with such a remarkable 
experience.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our focus each year is to ensure a safe physical and emotional learning environment for all children and adults at Deerfield 
School.  A part of our emphasis on ensuring a safe environment for our chi
ldren is training the staff in emergency 
preparedness, such as search and rescue techniques and stranger intruder response. Earthquake, lock down and fire drills 
including evacuation procedures are also conducted regularly to familiarize our students with 
effective emergency 
responses as well. Many of our teachers are trained in Medic First Aid to ensure that they are medically prepared for a 
disaster.  Deerfield has developed a comprehensive Safe School Plan. Our plan is evaluated yearly and amended, as ne
eded 
by the School Site Council or school safety planning committee. Key elements of the plan include: 1. Assessing the current 
status of school crime committed on the school campus and at school
-
related functions, 2a. Child Abuse Reporting 
Procedures, 2b.
 
Disaster Procedures
-
Routine and Emergency, 2c. Policies for Suspension, Expulsion and Mandatory 
Expulsion, 2d. Procedures for Notification of Staff Regarding Dangerous Students, 2e. Policies on Sexual Harassment, 2f.

Parents, and School Employees To and From School, 2h. Procedures that Create a Safe and Orderly Environment Conducive 
to Learning at School, 2i. Rules and Procedures on
 
School Discipline.  In addition, Deerfield has developed a positive 
behavior support program for students emphasizing the Falcon 5: kindness, honesty, respect, responsibility and safety.  
Additionally, through a collaborative process involving our staff, 
students, and parents, Deerfield has developed a Positive 
Behavior Intervention System (PBIS) to clearly define expectations of student behavior to foster an ideal emotionally 
intelligent learning environment for our students.

place of more than 40 specific funding 
categories, the new model has established three sources of state funding with 
increased local discretion to determine how best to spend those funds in the service of students.  All districts receive a 
BASE of per
-
student funding that varies slightly depend
ing on grade level.  All districts also receive SUPPLEMENTAL 
funding.  IUSD has used BASE and SUPPLEMENTAL funding to support the following programs:
 
 
Site Programs and Services:  1) Support professional learning and teacher coaching through induction prog
ram, content 
TOSAs and teacher mentor program , 2) provide summer school and summer athletic programs, 3) Allocating site funding 
and staffing to support student achievement through support of Professional Learning Communities (PLC) and site PLC 
coaches, 4
) Elementary P.E. paraprofessionals, 5) Support for English language learners, 6) Elementary science, music, and 
art programs, 7) Purchase textbooks and instructional materials, 8) Develop a technology rich learning environment 
including; Technology matchi
ng programs, Technology Maintenance fund and site technology support staff, 9) Maintain 
previously implemented class

Finally, CONCENTRATION grant funding equal to 50 percent of the base is provided to districts in which English
-
learners, 
low
-
income students and foster youth exceed 55 percent of the total enrollment
.  Irvine Unified School District is not 
eligible for concentration funding because its enrollment does not exceed the 55 percent threshold.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuo
us Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The Deerfield staff and the Irvine Unified School District are highly dedicated to continuous professional development to 
provide the most effective instructional program for our students.  The District and site have staff development 
days, as 
well as afternoon and evening workshops for teachers which total 30 hours in addition to ongoing staff development 
during staff and team meetings. We continue to develop research based instructional strategies and practices, as well as 
methods to 
differentiate instruction to better meet student needs through the Professional Learning Communities model. 

-
wide goals for improving student achievement include efforts to refine our instructional focus based on 
student achievement data 
and to intervene and support all students more effectively. We are actively engaged in 
implementation of the newly adopted Common Core Standards and trainings for best instructional practices, classroom 
management to best promote student collaboration, cri
tical thinking and academic risk
-
taking opportunities, and 
curriculum and assessment development are happening at all levels
-
administrative, teachers and support staff.  Teachers 
are supported during implementation through in
-
class modeling, teacher
-
princi
pal meetings, grade level and vertical team 
collaboration, and student performance data reporting. In addition, we will research, develop and utilize progress 
monitoring tools for tier 2 and tier 3 interventions. Another area of focus will be behavior and 
student social/emotional 
support and wellness. This year, the staff will continue to be trained on Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS) 
aimed at establishing the social culture and behavioral supports needed for Deerfield to continue to be an
 
effective 
learning environment for each student and to further support student academic achievement. Another area of academic 
focus is the  implementation of Thinking Maps/Step Up to Writing to provide students with an organizational structure to 
develop 
deeper levels of thinking and application to writing. Promoting and practicing emergency preparedness and 
campus safety is always an on
-
going focus at Deerfield.
