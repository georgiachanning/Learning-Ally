By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Students feel comfortable and safe on school grounds before, during and after school. During school hours, students are super
vised 
by school faculty and staff. The school facility includes sufficient classroom space to meet the needs of 
an enrollment of ap
proximately 
627 students. The playground sufficiently provides play areas for students with the assistance of staggered scheduling to fac
ilitate 
efficient use of the playground. To ensure optimal learning opportunities, faculty and staff coordinate classro
om facility usage to 
include flexible grouping and intervention instruction. The District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean
, safe, and 
functional. To assist in this effort, the district uses a facility survey instrument developed by 
the State of California Office of Public 
School Construction. The results of this survey are available at the Brea Olinda Unified School District Business Office. Bel
ow is more 
specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ens
ure that students are provided with a clean, safe and 
functional learning environment. 
 
 
 
Age of School Buildings 
 
 
This school has 27 classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library/media lab and a school office with staff lounge, adult restroom
s, teacher 
work
room and health office. The main campus was built in 1981. Portable classrooms and library/media lab were added soon 
thereafter. 
 
 
 
Maintenance and Repair 
 
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Facilities and Maintenance . District maintenance su
pervisors are proactive and 
conduct inspections at school sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working ord
er are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that 
emergency repairs are given the 
highest priority. As of January 2019, none of the eight emergency conditions cited in Education Code 17592.72 exist at this s
chool. 
Current Facilities Inspection was completed in January 2020 by the Principal.
 
 
A Facility Co
ndition Assessment was conducted on April 
27, 2018 by EMG with specific repairs and detailed assessment of the site's condition.

Cleaning Process and Schedule 
 
 
The District governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is 
available 
at the school office or at the District office and fulfilled by our full
-
time day and night custodians. The Principal wo
rks with the custodial 
staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the District to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The plan pr
ovides 
students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes the following requireme
nts of 
SB 187 within their safe school plans: current status of school crime; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures,
 
routine 
and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual harassment policy; pr
ovision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and school employees; safe and orderly school environment; and s
chool 
rules and procedures. The school annually evaluates and updates the plan. Safety procedures are reviewed 
with school and District 
staff in the fall, at the start of each school year. Development of the safety plan was a joint effort of District & school s
taff, School Site 
Council and PTA. 
 
Brea Police Department and Brea Fire Department were consulted in the 
development and review of our plan. 
Parents receive and have web access to our Parent/Student Handbook with information about our campus.
 
 
 
Our action plan has four primary goals. They are: 1) All students and staff members are provided a safe learning and
 
teaching 
environment. 2) All students are safe and secure while at school, when traveling to and from school, and when traveling to an
d from 
school related activities. 3) District programs and approved community resources are made available to students an
d parents. 4) Our 
school will provide the educational environment where students, parents, staff, and community members shall effectively 
communicate in a manner that is respectful to all cultural, racial, and religious backgrounds. The plan provides stude
nts and staff a 
means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. 
 
 
 
Pa
rents and visitors are welcome and required to check in at the school office upon arrival and obtain a visitors badge; visito
rs are 
required to return to the school office upon departure to sign out. During lunch, recess and before and after school, assign
ed staff 
members supervise students and school grounds, including the cafeteria and playgrounds, to ensure a safe and orderly environm
ent.
