By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Currently, we have 80 students and are growing. Our popular after school program, SHARE enjoys a excellent attendance 
on any given day.
 
 
We stress academic growth, customized intervention and accelerated academics for those wh
o need a faster pace. We 
concentrate on the basics; Math and English Language Arts. These are the subjects all students need to be successful for 
a future career. Students explore technology, science, robotics, STEM, student government and history. We are 
fortunate 
to have highly qualified teachers and paraprofessional aides in every classroom at our school. Our teachers and staff work 
to create students with strong self esteem, empathy and goals for success. Anti
-
bullying and standing up as a group is 
enco

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety Plan is 
updated each year and is available at the school office. The plan addresses potential local crises 
and reviews how school officials will work with local and regional safety officials in various crises. Regular monthly fire 
drills plus earthquake, intruder,
 
and evacuation drills and alerts, prepare students and staff for emergency response. 
Because of the very small staff
-
to
-
student ratio, and the rural nature of our school, students are very safe. Staff members 
are always aware of the location of students a
nd are cooperative in making sure students are fully supervised. All visitors, 
students and staff are required to to be screened before entering campus. They sign
-
in at the school office and are 
escorted to their location by school staff. No visitors are a
llowed to be in the school without direct supervision. 
Montgomery Creek School is a closed campus.

An aggressive Title I program serves all students in the schools, especially those who are struggling to achieve proficiency 
in all scholastic areas. For students with learning handicaps, a Resource Specialist 
Program is offered. All K

be fewer than 20 students. All grades have daily PE which is staggered, allowing for 1/2 class
 
at a time, to receive additional 
intervention/enrichment. We have a robust sports program and beginning music program.  We provide Social and 
Emotional lessons daily using positive discipline and second step and twice a week with a certified Skill Streami

Staff development days are held annually throughout the year. Teachers and support staff work together to create 
curriculum, develop plans for the 
year, and schedule enrichment activities. Annually, the staff takes three staff 
development days, two before school and one in January, minimum days are scheduled once a week for continuing staff 
development. All teachers are provided high
-
quality, targete
d staff development. Specific areas of staff development 
include instructional strategies in reading/language arts and mathematics, classroom management strategies, and special 
topics as they become available. Teachers are encouraged to develop a personal 
plan of training, designed to increase 
their abilities in the classroom. All staff development is designed to motivate high standards of teaching and to promote 
student learning success. Teachers receive staff development through participation in activitie
s sponsored by the Shasta 
County Office of Education, through independent conferences and workshops, and through in
-
house training. Release 
time is provided for teachers to attend staff development activities. As teachers return from training and workshops
, they 
share their new knowledge with colleagues through informal school
-
wide meetings and through classroom 
demonstrations. Classroom paraprofessional instructional aides receive staff development through the local junior 
college, through the Shasta Count
y Office of Education, and through regional workshops. The focus for 2018
-
2019 and 
2019
-
2020  is implementation and continuous review and improvement of our PBIS, and our school wide assessment, 
intervention and enrichment programs.  This process will be d
ata driven, conducted by staff teams and reviewed bi
-
weekly.
