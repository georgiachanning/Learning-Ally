School Description
 
Millbrook Elementary School, one of eighteen schools in the Evergreen School District, opened in 
September 1985. A portion of our facility, the multipurpose room, is shared (joint use agreement) 
with the City of San Jose for classes, after school programmi
ng, community activities/events and 
summer educational events. This includes a pre
-

-
school 
homework and recreation program, which is also available to Millbrook students through the City 
of San Jose. Our campus serve
s a student population that is ethnically, culturally, and linguistically 
diverse.
 
 
Common Core Standards and 21st Century Learning are pillars of our philosophy and include 
communication, creativity, collaboration and critical thinking into our instructio
nal program. We 
continue to build relevance between the academics of school and real world experiences through 
meaningful lessons integrating technology.  In recent years our teachers have implemented new 
curriculum programs in math and language arts. Seve
ral of our teachers are piloting science 
curriculum based on the Next Generation Science Standards. A history/social science adoption is 
looming.  As a school with a focus on the future, we are researching ways to transition to a global 
literacy focus wher
e the goal is to develop the ability of all students throughout our school to 
identify, interpret, analyze, synthesize, create, use, communicate, and share new knowledge using 
the written word, multimedia, and communication technologies with a worldwide au
dience. The 
Millbrook working definition of global literacy includes the following:
 
 
Global Literacy  is an understanding of how the world is organized and interconnected and the 
possibilities and constraints facing its people. Globally literate students a
nalyze and think critically 
about the world and their roles in it. They become fluent investigators of the world, celebrating our 
diversity as global citizens. This year, a focus of our character building program has been kindness.  
Our student recognition
 
and schoolwide events of giving are connected to displaying empathy.
 
 
It is evident, that Millbrook's global literacy specialty area, logically lends itself to our district's 
Profile of a Learner (POL) where the desired result is promoting students as lea
rners, 
communicators, collaborators,  critical thinkers, innovators, and advocates. Here, students are 
engaged in authentic learning that prepares them with the skills to be global minded citizens. This 
year we are focusing on the concept of kindness and h
ow that manifests in our actions and deeds 
as advocates.
 
 
Additionally, Millbrook School provides a family
-
oriented, nurturing, and safe place for students to 
learn, grow, and develop intellectually. Teachers, staff, and administrators continue to act on the 
principle that students come first. As we always tell o
ur students, it is important to have high 
expectations and set goals. This year is no exception. In addition to strong foundation skills, the 4 

Standards wi
ll be incorporated across the curriculum in our efforts to prepare our students for 
college and workplace. Through strategic, collaborative planning with teachers and parent leaders, 
we will meet the individual needs of all students. Additionally, we will 
address the academic 
challenges of those aforementioned standards as demonstrated by the California Assessment of 
Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) along with other equally critical assessment pieces. 
Working together, the sky is the limit in what 
we can accomplish.

Community & School Profile
 
Evergreen School District, located in the City of San Jose, is comprised of fifteen elementary schools and three middle schoo
ls. Once a 
small farming city, San Jose became a magnet for s
uburban newcomers between the 1960s and the 1990s, and is now the third largest 
city in California, behind Los Angeles and San Diego. The city is located in Silicon Valley, at the southern end of the San F
rancisco Bay Area, 
and is home to more than 1,000,0
00 residents.

grades kindergarten through sixth on a traditional calendar schedule.
 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountab
ility Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and A
ccountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data reported 
in
 
the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP,

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or t
he 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Evergreen School District held a Public Hearing on October 10, 2010, and determined that each school
 
within the district has sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California.
 
 
All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textb
ooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects 
for use in the classroom and to take home. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the district must be aligned
 
with the California State 
Content Standards, with final approval by the
 
Board of Trustees. Textbooks and supplementary materials are typically adopted according to a cycle 
developed by the California Department of Education. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the qua
lity, currency, and 
availabili
ty of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. The district does not have a formal textbook adoption
 
for Health or for Visual and Performing Arts.
 
 
The California State Board of Education adopted science programs at its November 2018 public meeting.  Evergreen will review 
materials in 2019
-
20 to 
determine next steps.  The California State Board of Education adopted Social Science materials at its Nove
mber 2017 public meeting aligned to the new 
California Framework.  The California Social Science standards remain unchanged.
 
 
Pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, a school district may utilize instructional materials not adopted b
y the
 
SBE, so long as the 
materials are aligned to state standards and a majority of the participants of any review process conducted by the district a
re classroom teachers who 
are assigned to the subject area or grade level of the materials being reviewed.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Millbrook Elementary School, originally constructed in 1985, is currently comprised of 38 permanent classrooms, an Speech roo
m, four Parks & Recreation 
rooms, a library, a multipurpose room, a staff lo
unge, and one playground. Major remodeling projects on all facilities were completed between 2005 and 
2007. A recent bond measure will allow us to move forward with Kindergarten Yard improvements.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 
Millbrook Elementary School provides a s
afe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district has adopted cleaning standards for 
all schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the school year with emphasi
s on classrooms and 
restrooms. 
A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
M
aintenance & Repair:
 

vy maintenance functions 
occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is a
dministered by the district to ensure that school grounds and 
facilities remain in excellent repair. A work order process is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. Emerg
ency repairs are given the 
highest priority; repair requests are comp
leted efficiently and in the order in which they are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
The State School Deferred Maintenance Program provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures 
for major re
pair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditio
ning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. In the Budget Act of July 2009, the State Legislature p
rovided school districts with flexibility in 
using these funds to meet general fund needs. In an effort to mitigate the effects of declining state revenues, the Evergreen
 
School District has taken 
advantage of this flexibility. The district will utilize bo
nd funds and other appropriate sources to ensure its facilities are clean, safe and in good repair.

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

ct Website and School 
Loop keep the public updated on 
opportunities for involvement at Millbrook Elementary School.
 
 
This is the 9th year of the Project Cornerstone ABC Reading Program and it has been quite successful. Parents are trained to 
read stories and conduct 
activities related to character skills once

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Millbrook Elementary School. Students are supervised before school, 
during recess, and after 
school by teachers and administrators. Lunch supervision is provided by noon
-
duty aides. We provide extra 
noon time supervision for our newly 
implemented full day transitional kindergarten and kindergarten programs. These supervisors have all been trained in mandated
 
child abuse and 
reporting as a prerequisite to their employment. All visitors to the campus mu
st sign in at the main office and wear a visitor

s pass at all times during 
their stay on school grounds. There is also a designated area for student drop
-
off and pick
-
up at the front of the school. 
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan was last reviewed and updat
ed in February, 2019 by the Emergency Response Team (ERT) and the Safety Committee. It will 
be reviewed again this winter with a revision submission date of February 7, 2020. Any and all revisions to the plan are imme
diately communicated to 
classified and 
certificated staff. Key elements of the Safety Plan focus on the following:
 

 
People and Programs
 

 
Place (facility)
 

 
School rules & procedures
 

 
Sexual harassment policy
 

 
Current status of school crime

are conducted on a rotating 
basis throughout the 
school year. Faculty has been trained in Run, Hide, Defend procedures. Several of our staff members have been trained in 
Therapeutic Crisis Intervention techniques. Millbrook's Comprehensive Safety Plan is available and can be requested to view i

Staff members build teaching skills and concepts through participation in conferences and workshops throughout the year. In a
ddition, we regularly meet 
as Professional Learning Communities (PLC's) to improve our practices in regards to CA Common Core State
 
Standards, Global Literacy, and 21st Century 
Learning.  For the past few years, the district has sponsored staff development days annually where teachers are offered a br
oad
-
based variety of 
professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strate
gies, and methodologies.
 
 
This year is no different in our efforts to continue the work. In addition, staff meetings, grade level meetings, and site in
-
service days are utilized for 
professional development.  Additionally, teachers have opportunities to at
tend conferences and workshops outside the district and even on
-
line for their 
convenience. The many structures of PD offered can accommodate all who are interested in taking advantage of improving and re
fining their craft.
 
 
Inservice days of professional 
staff development are provided in the Evergreen School District. One has traditionally taken place in August, when teachers 
return. The other takes place in late September. Thursdays are minimum days for students. The second and fourth Thursdays of 
the mon
th are devoted 
to deep, meaningful staff development work or site
-
determined needs that are timely and based on present topics of interest and implementation. A 
focus this year is English Learner Development (ELD).
 
Teachers may collaborate on the other rem
aining Thursdays, and often do so. They may also sign up for professional development at the district level.
 
 
Finally, for the 2019
-
20 school year, we have a team of teachers spanning attending the Santa Clara County Office of Education's "Access for All" 
training 
for the second year, specific to English language learner needs. This year, they will attend four full workshop trainings, wi
th follow up through the 2020
-
21 school year. This includes comprehensive training in the EL Roadmap publication from the 
CA Department of Education.
