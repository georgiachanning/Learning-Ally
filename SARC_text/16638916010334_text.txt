By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Corcoran Unified School District receives funds from the Williams Settlement; therefore district personnel are required to 
conduct an extensive facilities inspection.  The condition of the facilities and grounds are import
ant. In preparation for 
this report, the Director of Maintenance, Operations, and Transportation and the Chief Business Official provided the 
necessary information. The chart below shows the general condition of the site. Good repair is defined as maintain
ing 
schools that are clean, safe, and functional.
 
 
Bret Harte Elementary School facilities are in good repair. A complete modernization project for the interior of all 
classrooms was completed in August, 2016 prior to the beginning of the school year. Ther
e are minor plumbing needs in 
various classrooms, replacement ceiling tiles needed in various rooms and minor carpet and floor tile replacements 
needed from wear and tear. For a detailed report, please refer to the body of the School Accountability Report 
Card.  A 
complete copy can be found on the CUSD web page, at the district office, or at Bret Harte office.
 
 
All of the plumbing issues have been corrected. Painting, replacing ceiling tiles and repairing torn carpet will be smaller 
projects done throughout
 
the course of the school year.

At the beginning of the school year, the district office provides two days of training in Kagan and Imagine Learning. Through
 
the cycle of inquiry process, the staff at Bret Harte also felt a need to focus additional resources this year to continue 
profess
ional development opportunities for reading comprehension strategies and writing. Teachers will receive an 
additional ten days of instruction this year focusing on using the Writing Units of Study, as well as two days for the 
implementation of the new scie
nce adoption materials. Teachers receive additional professional development during the 
school year in the form of two hour blocks each Wednesday. This training will focus on Imagine Learning, Imagine Math, 
Data Cycles of Inquiry, Collaboration opportuniti
es, ELD strategies for instruction, Reading Comprehension and Kagan 
structures. Support staff will also receive training on handling difficult behaviors in the classroom, CPI training, and 
strategies to teach reading instruction to students during the Wedn
esday meeting time. New teachers work with mentors 
and the coaching staff to complete NTI requirements for the county. All teachers are supported by the academic coach, 
technology coach, resource teacher, reading instruction specialist and principal. They 
also have opportunities for 
professional development through TCOE and KCOE when requested.
