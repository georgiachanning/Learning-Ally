About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The current facilities opened in 1949 and to date includes three classroom wings, a mul
tipurpose room, an administrative office, and two sections of 
portable classrooms. Chabot Elementary School currently has eighteen  classrooms, a library,  a science lab, resource room, a
nd an onsite childcare facility 
that is housed in a separate portable
 
classroom. In addition, the Parent Club has designed and built a  kindergarten playground and with contributions 
from the Student Council and private sponsors have created an outdoor science center. All classrooms have wired and wireless 
internet access. 
 
During 
the winter of 2007, Chabot completed extensive modernization and retrofitting to update the school campus. In 2016, voters ap
proved Measure G which 
brought many improvements to the campus, including painted and updated classrooms, new blinds in cla
ssrooms and the MUR, a shade structure over 
some of the lunch tables, a new playground and replacement of the rubber bark with astroturf. More improvements are still pla
nned as not all of the 
classrooms have been renovated yet, eventually, the older portab
les will be replaced by the new portables.  Chabot's campus is maintained by a daytime 
custodial/grounds staff member and a night
-
time custodian. District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good 
repair and working or
der are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are
 
given the highest priority.  The lighting and sound systems as well as the curtains on the stage are due to be replaced this 
year.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority
 
4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessmen
ts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the 
University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement 
(Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Chabot Elementary School parents are very active in the 
school. Parent involvement can be seen in many aspects of the school including leadership, 
classes, fund raising, classroom volunteering, organizing book fairs and supporting many fun activities for children. The mos
t visible area in which parents 
help is 
the annual school play which involves countless volunteers. Parents are members of school leadership committees such as: Pare
nts Club, School 
Site Council, Parent Leadership, PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention System) , ELAC (English Language Advisory Co
mmittee) and Community Outreach. 
The Parents Club raises over $60,000 each year to improve programs on campus through an Auction, the Chabot Tigerthon, a Crab
 
Feed, and the yearly 
membership drive. "Fun"
-
raising events include: Bingo Night, the Sweetheart 
Dance, a Scholastic Book Fair, Shriek
-
a
-
Rama, Tigerthon, and Skate Night. 
Parents are also involved as classroom volunteers, chaperones, and instructors in the Music for Minors program. This year we 
added a School Smarts 
Class as well as a 10 week Black Mi
nds Matter course to our parent education opportunities. The school runs math night for families as well as Back to 
School Night and Open House. Chabot parents are involved in the school district's Strategic Planning Committee, LCAP committe
e and Equity co
mmittee.
 
 
Numerous programs and activities are enriched by the generous contributions made by the following organizations:
 

 
School Site Council
 

 
Student Council
 

 
Parents Club
 

 
Business Donations
 

 
Family Contributions
 
Parents or community members who wish to par
ticipate in site leadership teams, school committees, school activities, or volunteer on campus may

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Chabot Elementary School's Safety Plan
 
is reviewed and updated annually in October  by the School Site Council which is composed of the principal, 
certificated staff, classified staff and parents. Staff training is conducted at the beginning of each school year, in August
 
and addressed at staf
f meetings 
throughout the year. Each classroom has an emergency supply backpack and Chabot Elementary School maintains enough emergency 
supplies to sustain 
450 people for three days. Emergency drills are held monthly including fire/earthquake and lockdown 
drills. Chabot participates in the Great Shake Out 
in October which includes activating the Emergency Response Center, search and rescue, setting up the medical station and pra
cticing the release 
triangle.  After the drill, we review the safety plan and ma
ke improvements to it.  Information for parents regarding the emergency procedures are sent 
home in Tiger Tales.  Additionally, all staff are ALICE trained on how to react to an active shooter situation.
 
The school participates in 2nd Step Character educat
ion and is in the 6th year of PBIS where discipline and positive reinforcement are being reviewed. 
Chabot participated in a California MTSS (multi 
-
tiered system of support) initiative called SUMS (Scale Up MTSS Statewide) and received grants for 3 
years w
hich allowed us to collect valuable climate data.
