Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and communit
y members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and 
other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation
, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
At April Lane Elementary School, we believe all children are able to learn. April Lane provides children with a positive and 
challenging educational experience in a caring environment that develops self
-
esteem, self
-
motivation, physical wellness
, 
and responsibility. Our school strives to promote an enthusiasm for learning by recognizing and stimulating special talents 
in all students and providing every opportunity for maximum student achievement. The educational environment and 
teaching strategi
es are designed to meet the goals and objectives of a dynamic curriculum including Wonders and Go 
Math.   AVID strategies are taught to students in Kindergarten through fifth grade. Students are preparing to become 
responsible citizens by learning to care 
for themselves, others, and the world community in order to take their places as 
productive members of an integrated, democratic society. We believe education is a cooperative effort involving home, 
school, and community.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress 
[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or
 
programs 
of study.

April Lane School is fortunate to have an involved and supportive parent community that assists students and staff in the 
classrooms and throughout the school.   April Lane Parent Teacher Student 
Club (PTSC) regularly gives to the school and 
enriches the education of children.  Community organizations have also contributed to supporting the school through 
donations.  April Lane Elementary School is comprised of teachers and classified staff that do
nate their time in order to 
provide enrichment opportunities for our students.  April Lane hosts a variety of parent/student nights throughout the 
school year such as Cultural Night, Ice Cream Social, and Family Science Night in order or provide academic a
nd social 
activities that parents and students can do together. The English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) meets four times a 
year to educate, inform, and advise our parents of English Learners on the curriculum, instructional practices, and 
programs.  
We also offer English Classes on our campus through the Sutter County Library to our Farsi and Spanish 
speaking parents. Nurtured Heart is also offered to our Farsi, Spanish, and English speaking parents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
April Lane Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. A team of three 
full
-
time custodians ensures classrooms, restrooms, and campus grounds are kept clean and safe. A scheduled 
maintenance program is administered by Yuba City Unified School District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are 
well maintained. The Schoo
l Site Safety Plan was reviewed, updated, and presented to staff on August 9, 2019 for the 
2019
-
2020 school year by the Safety Committee, which consists of teachers, custodians, and the principal.
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of April
 
Lane Elementary School. The school is monitored at all times with 
security cameras and all gates are locked during the school day. The school is in compliance with all laws, rules, and 
regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake sta
ndards. The school's disaster preparedness plan 
includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire, earthquake, and intruder drills are conducted 
on a regular basis throughout the school year.  A committee of staff members have be
en trained in the Incident Command 
System for fire, earthquake, and intruder situations. This training  will continue throughout the 2019
-
2020 school year.
