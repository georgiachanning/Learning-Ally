About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
dist
rict office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructio
nal Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All Ross Valley School District students have access to high
-
quality textbooks and instructional materials pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the 
State of California. The Ross Valley School District establishes a
 
committee of teacher leaders for the review and adoption of standards
-
aligned curriculum 
materials; recommendations are then made to the board of trustees for approval. During the 2019
-
20 school year, the district is piloting science 
curriculum materials 
for adoption. During the 2018
-
29 school year, the district adopted TCI History Alive! as our middle school history/social science 
curriculum. The below table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Ross Valley School District passed a $41 million facility bond in November 2010 to 
accommodate increased enrollment and replacement and or 
repairs at Manor and at all other schools in the district.  Minor repairs will be made.
 
 
Ross Valley School District uses Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies and the least toxic method of pest
 
control possible as a means to control 
unwanted pests. In accordance with AR 3514.2 IPM strategy focuses on long
-
term prevention or suppression of pest problems through a combination of 
techniques such as monitoring for pest presence and establishing trea
tment threshold levels, using non
-
chemical practices to make the habitat less 
conducive to pest development, improving sanitation, and employing mechanical and physical controls. Pesticides that pose the
 
least possible hazard 
and are effective in a manner 
that minimizes risks to people, property, and the environment are used only after careful monitoring indicates they are 
needed according to established guidelines and treatment thresholds. ( California Education Code §17609; Food and Agricultura

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the S
tate priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education populat
ion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
alig
ned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that 
satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 

developed in coordination 
with Marin County emergency agencies suc
h as Fairfax Police and Ross Valley  Fire Department. Our plan includes procedures for earthquake, fire, and 
lock down drills and shelter in place.  The school community practices a variety of emergency drills on a scheduled basis. Th
e number of drills is 
determined by California Education Code.  Students are trained to play active roles in these drills.  School Administrators a
nd staff attend annual trainings 
to better prepare the school for unanticipated emergencies. The plan includes procedures for disas
ter preparedness and response. Our site's emergency 
plan includes a complete NIMS chart, training includes search and rescue, basic first aid, and student release. Our emergency
 
supply container is checked 
and re
-
stocked yearly.
 
 
Board policies on suspensi
on and expulsion, procedures to notify teachers of dangerous pupils, sexual harassment, school
-
wide dress code, procedures 
of safe ingress and egress of pupils and rules and procedures on school discipline are also components of the plan. The plan 
may be r
eviewed in detail at 
the school site.
 
 
The District has installed window film for safety and security at each site. All door locks have been checked and only requir
e a push button to lock and 
secure each room.  All door locks have been checked and only req
uire a push button or simple motion to remove a door block  to lock and secure each 
room.  In addition, the telephone system allows each school to call 911 and to contact the District in the event of an emerge
ncy.  Also, the walkies talkie 
system has been

The focus of 
professional development for 2019
-
20 is on creating opportunities for teachers to deepen their understanding of district initiatives while 
sharing best practices. We kicked off the year with an inservice on Culturally Responsive Teaching as a part of our E
quity and Inclusion initiative. Our 
October professional development day was led by a cadre of teacher leaders who introduced their colleagues to the History
-
Social Science Standards 
driving questions and the importance of including the counternarrative in
 
their teaching. Our final professional development day of 2019
-
20 took the 
form of a mini
-
conference in which teachers shared expertise on a variety of topics including Low Floor/High Ceiling Math Tasks, Sensory Int
egration 
Techniques, Examining Implicit 
Bias, and Tier One Strategies for the General Education Teacher. Additionally, we have a cadre of literacy coaches who 
are in their second year of working with their colleagues in supporting the implementation of Reading and Writing Workshop.
 
During the 20
18
-
19 school year, teachers received training on Implicit Bias and Compassionate Dialogue as a part of our district Equity Initi
ative. Teacher 
leaders facilitated a training on the NGSS Science and Engineering Practice of Modeling and phenomena
-
based instr
uction.
 
The focus of 2017
-
18 professional development was on the implementation of a new TK
