By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Mission Statement
 
Westmont School is committed to maintaining an atmosphere in which students d
evelop the desire to learn by working 
in partnership with parents, staff, and community. Our school provides a strong comprehensive education for all of our 
students in order to prepare for and value citizenship, employment, and further education. Through 
educational 
excellence we cultivate participation, enthusiasm, and success, all of which prepare our students to function in a rapidly 
changing world.
 
 
Our Mission at Westmont Elementary School, in partnership with the community, is to enable a learning en
vironment that 
encourages high expectations for success and mutual respect. Our goal is to enable our children to become productive, 
responsible citizens.
 
 
We will accomplish this by instilling a Culture of Universal Achievement.:
 

 
Provide a strong 
comprehensive scholastic education program.
 

 
Maintain a campus atmosphere and organize school activities that promote responsible, honest behavior 
directed towards developing citizens who perceive themselves as important participants in a democratic 
society
.

About Our School
 
Westmont Elementary School is a wonderful place of learning. Students thrive 
under the care of a dedicated staff and 
community.
 
 
We are proud to offer simultaneous biliteracy acquisition via our Dual Language Immersion Program. Native Spanish 
speakers and native English speakers work together in an integrated class, acquiring the g
rade
-
level school curriculum 
through Spanish and English. Research shows that English Learners in Dual Language Programs score higher on state tests, 
master more curriculum, learn more & better English, than ELs in other programs. African American, White, 
and, Special 
Ed native English speakers score higher on state tests. Student engagement is higher in Dual Language classes. Dual 
Language students become fully proficient in a second language at no cost to their English development. Learning in two 
languag
es develops inactivated brain areas and increases creativity and problem
-
solving skills.

Student enrichment opportunitie
s connect to College Readiness. Through a partnership with the Cal Poly Pomona Lyle 
Center for Regenerative Studies, Westmont students were mentored by six university students, or Lyle Center Fellows. 
They engaged in career counseling and various science
-
b
ased workshops. All students from grades 1 through 6 explore 
the Cal Poly University campus during inspiring college awareness tours that the Fellows design just for them.
 
 
Integral to instilling Total Literacy Connection, Westmont students practice and ce
lebrate reading each and every day as 
monitored by Accelerated Reader®. Our goal is for each student to read daily, within his or her individual Zone of Proximal 
Development at 85% comprehension rate. Students select from over 18,000 books during their wee
kly school library visits. 
Our average circulation rate is approximately 7000 books per month.
 
 
Every student explores mathematical concepts in a way that is structured to sustain productive struggle and thus ensure 
connectivity via ST Math. Progress is mo
nitored and celebrated regularly.
 
 
Over 90 Westmont students receive daily extended
-
day services focused on Reading, Mathematics, homework, Physical 
Education and content enrichment during The Learning Connection (TLC) after
-
school program. Students attend
 
TLC daily 
from 2:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Monday 

 
Friday.
 
 
Core, Benchmark and Strategic students identified through District
-
wide Assessments, Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early 
Literacy Skills (DIBELS), and the Diagnostic Online Reading / Math Assessment (D
ORA & ADAM) receive services as 
indicated by our Pyramid of Interventions during Universal Access as well as during the remainder of the school day, and 
before and after school tutoring. Teachers, the Principal, and parents, as members of and in cooperatio
n with the Student 
Success Team (SST) and the Special Education Team (SET) measure student Response to Intervention (RtI) to determine 
that special needs are addressed for individual students. Both academic and behavioral interventions are prescribed as 
ne
eded.

Safety: Safety of the students and staff is a primary concern of the Pomona Unified School District. All schools in the distr
ict 
are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials. A disaster preparedness plan is in 
pl
ace for earthquakes and emergency evacuations and all stakeholders participate in annual drills. All buildings within the 
district are in compliance with state earthquake standards. A discipline policy may be found at each school that seeks to 
insure a saf
e and orderly environment for students and staff.

A Safe School Plan has been adopted, and it includes policies on disaster preparedness, student discipline, the components 
of a safe and orderly school environment, suspension/expulsion procedures, safety,
 
child abuse reporting procedures, 
student dress codes, and student and staff sexual harassment. The safety plan was most recently approved by the School 
Site Council on January 18, 2017. We integrate three elements into our program to promote student well

Good first teaching
 
by our dedicated staff in the first line of defense in keeping our students safe. Our teachers and 
students have internalized a culture of universal achievement. We see problems as opportunities to learn and persevere. 
We plant the seeds for higher learni
ng. Each classroom has "adopted" a university that they learn about. Westmont 
students participate in university visits. Our after school program, TLC, provides a safe academic haven for students while 
their parents are at work. Students receive academic a
nd behavioral interventions as described in the About this School 
section of this document.
 
 
CHARACTER EDUCATION
 
It is our mission to give students skills to lead fulfilling lives, especially ability to make sound choices. We instill in s
tudents 
traits suc
h as kindness, responsibility and perseverance through various practices. The day begins with an uplifting 
message. The Words of Wisdom are read over the PA system by the principal or Student Council leaders. The school year 
launches with a series of lesso
ns designed to lay a strong foundation of reminders and guidance. Teachers lead weekly 
class meeting during which students discuss problems and solutions for issues that may arise on the playground and such. 
We also have integrated a mindfulness program

that combines stretching, 
breathing and learning life points to promote A HELATHY MIND, HEALTH BODY, HEALTHY LIFESTYLE.
