By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg

.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
Mission Statement
 
Valuing diversity and full inclusion, t
he mission of Cameron Ranch School is to ensure that each student becomes an 
informed critical thinker, strong communicator, and self
-
directed learner through personalized, rigorous instruction, 
utilizing technology, and modeling positive character traits 
in a safe, nurturing, respectful environment, in partnership 
with parents and community.
 
 
School Profile
 
Cameron Ranch Elementary is one of 33 elementary schools in the San Juan Unified School District.  The curriculum 
provided is aligned to the Common Cor
e State Standards.  The school supports cultural awareness on a daily basis through 
its diverse literature selections and other school activities.
 
 
As a full inclusion site for children with developmental disabilities, Cameron Ranch is dedicated to develop
ing the 
individual potential of all students.  We believe that each student has the right to be successful academically and socially.
  

together to share knowledge and ideas to provide a rich learning environment for students.
 
 
We base our school behavior and discipline on the Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS).  We implement 
responsive classroom strategies and structures t
o provide a positive community of learners in every classroom. Students 
learn social skills and problem solving through weekly Second Step curriculum lessons in our general education classrooms. 
We provide a tiered system of behavior supports including soc
ial skills groups, check
-
in/check
-
out, individual behavior 
charts and positive rewards.
 
 
The Cameron Ranch principal, teachers, and staff value diversity and excellence.  Our mission is to educate and inspire 
each student to succeed and 
responsibly contribute to a radically evolving world by providing innovative, rigorous, 
student
-
focused instruction and programs in a safe, caring, and collaborative learning community.
 
 
We are a Response to Intervention school, which addresses the individ
ual needs of each student.  We have implemented 
a scientific, research
-
based balanced literacy program with the belief that every student can learn to read and write.  
Within our balanced literacy program we differentiate instruction employing a number of 
strategies to meet the varied 
needs of individual students.
 
 
Cameron Ranch is a data driven school.  All staff members have been trained on using the Illuminate system and gather 
formative assessment information during daily instruction to target learning 
for each student. Illuminate provides teachers 
with information needed to plan focused instruction and provides internal accountability.  Teachers are able to measure 
and monitor student progress using this data so that instruction is precise and personali
zed.
 
 
We ensure that all students have access to core curriculum, all teachers are highly qualified, and interventions are checked 
frequently for proper placement of students.  Teachers provide rigorous instruction based on Common Core State 
Standards.

We
 
pay close attention to the culture and climate of our school.  We provide varied opportunities for our children to learn 
in an environment that is safe and fosters personal and academic growth.
 
 
Cameron Ranch staff holds high expectations for all stakehol
ders.  We practice the following beliefs:  that every person is 
unique and has equal worth, that every student can and will learn, and that diversity is a valuable asset that strengthens 
and enriches our community. Through these multiple beliefs we have be
en able to start closing the achievement gap.
 
 
We believe that parent involvement is the key to building a sound foundation that encourages academic and personal 
achievement.  Parents are invited to attend classroom visitations referred to as Family Day an
d themed activity mornings 
including Harvest Festival and Earth Day.  During Family Day, the parent shadows their student, thus developing an 
understanding of the classroom environment, how the instructional rigor is scaffolded for students throughout each
 
day 
and how they can support their child's educational experience.
 
 
Professional development occurs weekly at Cameron Ranch.  We provide time for grade level collaboration and 
professional learning communities.  We recognize the importance of ongoing teac
her learning and that it is directly linked 
to instructional practices and strategies.  In the past four years, we have based our professional development around PBIS, 
llluminate, Universal Access, Guided Reading, Critical Literacy, Running Records, and Wr
iter's Workshop.  This work will 
remain in place for all Cameron Ranch students, and for the current school year, staff is engaging in professional 
development around mathematics instruction and social
-
emotional learning, which includes the ongoing model o
f The 
Responsive Classroom. All of these trainings support classroom teaching strategies, school and class organization, 
balanced literacy instruction, intervention, conceptual mathematical understanding and assistance, as well as home, 
school and communit
y partnerships.
 
 
Cameron Ranch offers an after
-
school Bridges program.  Bridges After
-
School/ASSETs Programs provide homework 
support, enrichment and pro
-
social recreation in a safe and positive environment. The Bridges After
-
School/ASSETs 
Programs current
ly serve over 3,000 students, grades K
-
12, at 32 sites. Student success is supported through the 
implementation of each of the four components of the program: Homework support, enrichment/disguised learning, pro
-
social skills/recreation, and parent support
 
and empowerment. Strong relationships between program staff, school staff, 
parents and students are key! If you are interested in this program please contact the school office.
 
 
Principal's Message
 
Cameron Ranch seeks to provide a high
-
quality instruction
al program where staff utilizes strategies that target learning 
goals, integrating relevant technology and individualized assessment data to increase student proficiency. We seek to 
actively engage families and community as partners in the educational proc
ess, as well as identify, model, and integrate 
positive character traits and social skills instruction, to ensure all students become contributing, responsible, and caring 
members of our diverse community.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September, 2018
 
 
San Juan Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018 and determined that each school with
in the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standa
rds
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the te
xtbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended m
aterials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the quality, currency, and availability of 
the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional mate
rials used at the school. If you would like more information 
on the textbooks and instructional materials please visit our website: http://www.sanjuan.edu/Page/23485 In July 2009, 
EC Section 60200.7. The State Board of Education has adopted frameworks for 
ELA/ELD, Math, Science and Social 
Sciences, and has identified an approved list of instructional materials available for adoption. For more information

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Cameron Ranch was modernized and a new multipurpose room was added during the 2000
-
2001 school year. Expanded 
parking was provided at the front of the school, as well as a new ramp leading down to the resurfaced blacktop p
layground 
area. Two portable classrooms were totally remodeled. Currently there is sufficient space to house the student population. 
Discovery Club has its own classroom. There is a site custodial staff that cleans the building, along with district support
 
for 
major/minor repairs. The district provides gardening and landscape services on a regular schedule. Regular fire/emergency 
drills are held, and badges are required for all visitors and personnel. A major landscape and irrigation project was 
completed d
uring the summer of 2008 through Measure J Bond.  A low voltage upgrade which includes intercoms, fire 
and intrusion alarms, is scheduled for completion Spring 2014.
 
 
The Board of Education and the Superintendent's policy is to ensure that all students are provided with a safe and well
-
maintained learning environment. The board approved resolutions in 1998 and 2002 to adequately fund maintenance 
activities and preserve 
the repairs and improvements funded by two facility bond measures. The school buildings, 
classrooms and grounds are safe, clean and functional. An inspection of the facility was conducted in September 2019 and 
determined that there were no unsafe condition
s that required emergency repairs. District maintenance staff ensures 
that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
computer automated work order process is used to ensure efficient servi
ce and that emergency repairs and health and 
safety repairs are given the highest priority. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards and custodial staffing 
requirements for all schools in the district. This school meets the Board's standards f
or custodial staffing and cleanliness. 
The school's custodians are trained in the proper use of cleaning chemicals and Integrated Pest Management techniques. 
They are managed day to day by the Principal with assistance from the district's maintenance depar
tment. The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, with funding allocated for major repair or replacement 
of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electri
cal 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. Annually the district budgets $2 million dollars for deferred 
maintenance activities

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress 
[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or
 
programs 
of study.

Parents are a valuable asset to the entire school community.  Through the PTO, the school benefits from the beautification 
projects, assemblies, fundraising, and social opportunities such as ice cream socials, BBQ's, and parent programs. Parents 
are also a
ctive on the School Site Council and English Learner Advisory Council (ELAC) advising, exploring, and observing 
programs funded by Title 1 and LCFF money received from the state.  Each year, parents sign a pact with their student and 
the teacher pledging s
upport to the academic programs.  Many parents drive on field trips, assist with at
-
home tasks, 
volunteer in the classroom, serve as representatives to the District English Language Advisory Committee (DELAC) and the 

 
 
Monthly news
letters, weekly email blasts, our site website, Facebook, Instagram, School Messenger automated phone 
calls, Principal Coffee Chats and frequent teacher correspondence keep parents informed of events and activities, as well 
as student achievement results. 
Parents provide valuable feedback regarding our programs and their students' success 
through our monthly parent committees and Parent Survey which is given every winter.

a Community Safety Specialist assigned to this school within a geographic zone that includes nearby schools. In addition, 
via a part


school. The Deputy Sherif
fs are assigned to patrol a geographic zone either on the east side of the district or the west side 
of the district. They are assigned specific schools within their assigned zone and respond to this school, or others, as safe
ty 
needs dictate. The two CHPD
 
Police Officers are School Resource Officers (SRO) who work identified schools within the 
City of Citrus Heights and respond as safety needs dictate. The two law enforcement agencies will overlap response when 

fficers are dispatched to critical incidents via the Safe Schools Dispatcher, 
a law enforcement dispatcher or via a direct report from a school staff member, school visitor or other person. This school 
has a school safety team which reviews safety matters 
that may affect the campus. Our school safety team meets regularly 
to discuss safety issues, update our site emergency plan, and to take steps to be proactive in preventing various types of 
school
-
related safety issues. Community Safety Specialists and law
 
enforcement provides speakers to address students, 
staff and community groups on matters of school safety. Our safety team receives training, when requested, from Safe 
Schools or law enforcement. This school is responsible for updating our Comprehensive S
chool Safety Plan (CSSP) by March 
1st of every year per the Education Code. As part of the update, this school meets at least once per year with a law 
enforcement officer to review the CSSP, has the local fire department review the CSSP and we hold a commu
nity meeting 
to review the CSSP. The CSSP must be approved by the School Site Council before being submitted to the district safe 

site sp
ecific crisis response procedures and a district standardized emergency flip chart. This school conducts and keeps a 
record of all fire drills, lockdown drills, shelter in place drills and/or earthquake drills up to or in excess of what is re
quired 
by the 
Education Code.

Professional development is a key part of the continuous improvement process for educators. The goal of our quality 
professional development is to support the learning of teachers and paraprofessionals to positively impact student 
achievement.  Annually, t
eachers and site administrators participate in professional development in a variety of 
opportunities.  Seventy
-
five minutes per week are dedicated to staff collaboration and training planned by site leadership 
teams. The District also provides a cycle of 
continuous professional development for Administrators through Principal 
Networks as well as Leadership Academies.
 
 
The District provides professional development opportunities for teachers and administrators that support the 
implementation of Common Core 
State Standards in English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and the 
ELA/ELD Framework.  Specific professional development initiatives include: Culturally Responsive Practices, Critical 
Literacy, TK
-
2 Reading, Supporting Independence and
 
Engagement through Reading and Writing, Math to the Core, 
Expository Reading and Writing Course, and ELD Foundations.  District departments, Center for Teacher Support, grant
-

ing opportunities.  Professional 
development opportunities are voluntary for teachers and are provided throughout the year in a variety of formats: during 
the school day, after school, on Saturdays, and during summer and vacation breaks. Many teachers and 
administrators 
also take advantage of opportunities with Sacramento County Office of Education, California Department of Education, 
the college/university programs, state/national education organizations, and private educational institutes.
 
 
What grounds t
he professional development in the district is the District Strategic Plan and the Local Control 
Accountability Plan. Professional Development is further determined using one or more of the following: (a) student 
achievement data, (b) staff survey data, an
d (c) district
-
identified goals.  Professional development addresses the Common 
Core State Standards, teaching strategies, curriculum, assessment, technology, classroom management, safety, and 
leadership. Administrator training accompanies professional dev
elopment in district focus areas, providing 
implementation support for teachers on site.  Content
-
area coaches are available at some schools.  Additional classroom 
support is provided to new and struggling teachers by consulting teachers from the Center fo
r Teacher Support.
