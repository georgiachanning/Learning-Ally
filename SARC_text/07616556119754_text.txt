School Description
 
 
Message From Principal
 
At R. Paul Krey Elementary School students, parents, staff and community work together to ensure 
that each student receives a rigorous, comprehensive, balanced and integrated educational 
program in a safe and caring environment.  All children have the oppo
rtunity to develop their ability 
to think critically, solve problems, communicate effectively, work independently and 
collaboratively, take risks, make decisions, be creative and help others. With students as our 
priority, the staff will reflect on our tea
ching practices, share ideas and concerns honestly, 
communicate regularly with parents and the community, and model a lifelong joy of learning 
through our own personal and professional growth.
 
 
Welcome to Krey Elementary,
 
Brian Jones, Principal
 
Brie Estep,
 
Vice Principal
 
 
School Mission Statement
 
Members of the R. Paul Krey School community believe students learn best in a safe, comfortable 
place where they feel supported and inspired, are not afraid to take risks, and are empowered to 
be a part of their ow
n education. Student attitudes and behaviors will be shaped by our Character 
Education program and the CASH matrix. Our character education program is enhanced by various 
character traits modeled and taught in both the classroom and in assemblies.  The sta
ff believes in 
a preventative rather than punitive discipline plan built on the underpinnings of well
-
taught, 
rehearsed routines and procedures, child
-
centered instruction that is both multi
-
modal, and 
developmentally appropriate. Our C.A.S.H. matrix (Come
 
Prepared, Act Respectfully, put Safety 
First, are Hard Workers) teaches students our behavior expectations. Both parents and teachers 
believe the most valuable courses in the curriculum are those that impart students with the 
necessary academic knowledge 
yet at the same time offer students an opportunity for self
-
awareness, creativity, tolerance, and responsibility. Site
-
based leadership that includes parents, 
teachers, and administration reflect the decision
-
making process and goal orientation of R. Paul 
Krey Elementary School.
 
 
District Mission Statement
 
The Brentwood Union School District will provide an exemplary education to all children in a safe, 
student
-
centered environment designed to nurture the whole child and partner with families to 
prepare glo
bally productive citizens.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.
