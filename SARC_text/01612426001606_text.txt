Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

aligned textbooks  or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take 
home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a
 
cycle developed by the State Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the state 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection 
committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption. The table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

Hillview 
Crest Elementary School realizes the positive correlation between parent involvement and student success. For 
this reason, the school continually searches for avenues to involve parents and the community to participate in the 
education of its students. The
 
school greatly benefits from its supportive parents who volunteer in the classroom or in the 
administration office. Parents are encouraged to join the School Site Council (SSC) and the English Learner Advisory Council 
(ELAC), the African American Advisory
 
at Hillview (AAA), and the Parent Teacher Club (PTC). Families and staff participate 
in community building events such as Trunk or Treat, biennial Community Service Fairs, and Family Literacy Night. The 
school also coordinates and hosts workshops for pare

parents request such as parenting skills, mental health, nutrition, and financial education.

classroom is equipped with backpacks filled with emergency supplies. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a regular 
basis throughout the school yea

certificated staff and the principal. Classified staff provide supervision during lunch and break periods. There is a 
designated area for student drop off and pick up
. Visitors must sign in at the front office and wear a badge while on 
campus.
