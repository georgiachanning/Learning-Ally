About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish
 
a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a 
Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent wi
th data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about
 
the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents at El Portal have many opportunities for involvement and are highly visible on our campus. Parents and other relative
s of our students are actively 
recruited and seen working on 
our campus. They volunteer daily in our library and in our classrooms. Families at El Portal understand that it is the 
partnership between home and school which creates a strong and positive learning environment for our students. Parents and co
mmunity memb
ers are 
often found volunteering on our campus. Our local junior high and high school students also volunteer time on our campus. Whe
n augmented by the 
expertise and caring of the teachers and staff at school, we are able to ensure a safe and industrious e
nvironment for our children, every day.  On any 
given day, a visitor to El Portal will find numerous volunteers working in classrooms and around school to help accomplish ou
r goals for the week, the 
month, and the year.
 
 
Through our very active Parent Teac
her Association (PTA), parents sponsor many programs, including: Spring Fair, Red Ribbon Week, special grade
-
level 
programs, fund
-
raisers that support our field trips and assemblies, Science on the Go, Family Nights, Family Picnic, and class parties. Thes
e
 
are just some 
of the many activities that take place through our PTA. Room Parents also help throughout in planning special events for our 
children. Parents are also 
involved in our English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) and School Site Council (SSC).
 
Parent involvement on our campus is an integral part of the 
success of our campus programs.

development has been focused on the writing process. Several of our teachers have attended seminars in math, reading, and tec

Language Learners. All of our staff has been trained in Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD). One afternoon each wee

each grade level. As a professional learning community, we evaluate and revise our mission statement, create and update curri

student goals each year. Science, Te

their class. Staff development is provided to focus on how to teach and integrate STEAM subject matter, and how to make it re
levant and enga

our students to learn.
