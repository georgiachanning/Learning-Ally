About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
dist
rict office.

e extent to which textbooks 
and instructional materials have been provided to students.
 
The Board of Education adopted Resolution 2019/2020
-
18 which certifies as required by 
Education Code 60119 that (1) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials have been provided to each student, including 
English learners, that are 
aligned to the ac
ademic content standards and consistent with the cycles and context of the curriculum frameworks in the following subjects: 
history/social science, mathematics, reading/language arts, and science, (2) sufficient textbooks or instructional materials 
were pr
ovided to each pupil 
enrolled in foreign language and/or health classes, (3) laboratory equipment was available for science laboratory classes off
ered in grades 9
-
12, inclusive.
 
 
Textbooks and instructional materials are provided for each student for use i
n class and to take home. It was determined that each pupil in each school 
has sufficient textbooks and instructional materials that are aligned to the academic content standards in the core subject a
reas for the 2019/2020 school 
year. Additionally, suffic
ient textbooks and/or instructional materials were provided to each pupil for visual and performing arts.*Please note: In 
reference to materials not from a most recent State Board Adoption (SBE): In November 2017, the California State Board of Edu
cation ap
proved a list of 
History/Social Science programs for districts to consider for their new adoption. CVUSD elected to continue to use current Di
strict adopted materials 
while further studying program options provided on the SBE list to consider for a future 
piloting process. CVUSD reviewed current District adopted 
materials and determined that they meet current history/social science standards.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Chino Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) makes it a priority to maintain safe, clean, and effective school sites for our 
students, staff, and parents. The 
safety of students is of paramount importa
nce to CVUSD. In the morning, staff supervision is provided to watch the cafeteria, entrance gates, and 
playground activities. During lunch and recess times, noon ground supervisors and teachers monitor students to ensure student
s interact safely. At the 
e
nd of the school day, staff supervises student dismissal. The staff and student workspaces for this site are cleaned on a reg
ular basis by the school site 
custodial staff. In addition to regular cleanings, deep cleanings are scheduled and carried out durin
g breaks and vacation periods. The school facility is 
adequate and has sufficient classrooms, playgrounds, and staff spaces in order to operate efficiently. A recently completed s
chool improvement for this 
site was the expansion of the front parking lot th
at was completed in the 2019/2020 school year. Schoolwide security camera and keyless access system 
is planned for the 2020/2021 school year. To ensure sites are clean, safe and functional, Maintenance and Operations departme
nt staff conduct 
inspections at
 
the school sites on a continual basis. School sites may also enter maintenance requests by accessing the School Dude system. 
After the 
school site request is entered into the system, a work order is generated, and the Maintenance staff works diligently to
 
complete all work orders in a 
timely manner.  The Maintenance team utilized the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT), a survey instrument developed by the State 
of California Office of Public 
School Construction (OPSC), to record inspection results. The overall
 

completed on or before December 30, 2019.
 
 
In addition to the District inspection that took place on July 23, 2019, representatives from the San Bernardino County Super
inten
dent of Schools (SBCSS) 
conduct annual Williams visits to schools ranked in deciles 1
-
3 in San Bernardino County to evaluate their "good repair" status. The Williams inspection 
for this site occurred on September 4, 2019. Results from this inspection are i
ncluded below, and any associated repairs were completed by the end of 
December 30, 2019.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Prio

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the

procedures. Emergency supplies

ffice and all visitors must sign in before 
going onto the campus. In addition, all visitors must wear an identifying badge while on campus. To increase security, all ga

The Chino Valley Unified School District is committed to providing an environment that fosters health and safety, in both for
m and function. This 
commitment extends to the process of developing and maintaining a comprehensive Emergency and Disas

Safe Schools Plan and is evident from the individual site to the overall District. These plans delineate actions to protect a
ll students while they are at 
school. The plans are designed with the help of sec
urity staff members, local law enforcement, local fire, and emergency management, and public health 
officials as required by Education Code 32280
-
32282.
 
 
Plans are reviewed and updated yearly in accordance with Education Code 32286. These plans include pro
cedures to respond to critical incidents, such 
as fire, earthquake, or intruders. School personnel practice these drills regularly.
 
 
The primary purpose of the Chino Valley Unified School District Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan is to define 
roles and responsibilities at the 
site and between the site and district office management. The Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan establishes the minimu
m requirements for 
school and site plans throughout the District. This Plan meets the requirement
s of the Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) as mandated 
by California Code of Regulations, Sections 2400
-
2450, and the National Incident Management System (NIMS) as mandated by Government Code 8607. 
It also meets the requirements for earthquak
e preparedness found in Title 5 (California State Education Code, Sections 35295
-
35297).
