School Description
 
Powell Elementary School of the Arts is a place where school and community come together for 
the success of our children.  Part of the Azusa Unified School District, Powell is the "Arts Focused" 
elementary school in 
Azusa, using visual and performing arts to enhance and enrich the curriculum. 
Our school intentionally integrates the arts throughout the core curriculum to deepen and enrich 
student learning.  Every day in classrooms at Powell, students are acting, singin
g, and dancing their 
way through lessons. Our dedicated art studio provides students with regular opportunities to 
draw, paint, sculpt and create.  Each year we put on fall, winter and spring performances; and as a 
school of the arts, we produce a full
-
sca
le musical annually for which students, grades 1st
-
5th, are 
welcome to audition.  Through strategic arts partnerships, our students participate in a yearly 
ceramics project as well as special music opportunities such as World Music Drumming and a Young 
Com
posers classes.
 
 

data from multiple assessments, administrators and teachers look at how well students are 
performing according to state grade
-
level standards, id
entifying areas of strength and weakness. 
Teachers modify instruction to ensure students succeed in meeting grade
-
level expectations.  All 
Powell classrooms implement rigorous common core aligned curriculum in math and language arts.  
English learners rece
ive daily designated as well as integrated ELD.  All Powell students participate 
in WIN (What I Need), a structured response to intervention program in which students receive 
targeted, on level, daily instruction to enhance reading ability.
 
 
At Powell Scho
ol we implement PBIS (Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports).  PBIS is a 
proactive system
-
wide framework for creating and maintaining safe and effective learning 
environments in schools and ensuring that all students have the social skills needed 
to ensure their 
success at school and beyond.  Students are specifically taught what the expected appropriate 
behaviors look like in all areas of the school and are acknowledged and rewarded when they behave 
in accordance with these expectations.  Our expe
ctations: Be safe, be respectful, be responsible.
 
 
Leadership at Powell Elementary School is a responsibility shared among district administration, 
the principal, instructional staff, students, and parents. Beginning in the 2013
-
14 school year, 
primary lea
dership duties were assumed by Principal Jennifer Wiebe. Prior to her arrival, she had 
25 years of experience in education in the following positions: classroom teacher, adjunct professor 
and director of an educational non
-
profit organization. The principa
l oversees the day
-
to
-
day 
operations of the school.
 
 
Coordinating with the principal are teachers who meet in Professional Learning Communities to 
align instruction to Common Core State Standards. Staff members and parents participate on 
various committees
 
that make decisions regarding the priorities and direction of the educational 

goals. These committees include Powell Panther Parents, English Learners Advis
ory Committee 
(ELAC), and School Site Council (SSC).

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Parents and community members are very active 
in and supportive of the educational program at Powell School of the Arts!  At Powell, we are a family
-
oriented community. Parents participate in committee groups such as Panther Parents, ELAC (English Language Advisory Committe
e), and SSC (School 
Site Cou
ncil).  Parents lead and participate in two Families in Schools workshops each year called Reading Roads and Transition to Mi
ddle School. These 
are multiple week classes for parents taught by parents. We also host numerous family fun events such as our Spr
ing Picnic Day, the Fall, Winter, and 
Spring Performances, our School

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is the primary concern at Powell Elementary 

ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire, earthquake, and lock down drills are conducted on a regular basis 
throughout the school year. 
Annually, the school practices a co
mplete earthquake drill, which includes an entire school evacuation. A storage bin located at the school contains food, 
water, and other supplies for use during a disaster.
 
 
All visitors must sign in at the front office, wear identification tags while on t
he school grounds and sign out upon departure. Teachers are on duty before 
school, during recess, and noon supervisors are on duty during lunch and after school to ensure the safety of all our student
s. Teachers, staff, and 
administrators are trained and p
ractice lock down procedures that, in an emergency, can secure the entire campus.
 
 
A Comprehensive School Safety Plan was developed by the Safe School Committee in order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997
. The plan provides 
students and staff a 
means to ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. Key elements of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan include the 
following: monthly facility safety inspections; child abuse reporting procedures; teacher notification of dangerous pupils pr
ocedures;
 
disaster response 
procedures; procedures for safe entering to, and exiting from, school; sexual harassment policy; suspension and expulsion pol
icies; dress code; and 
discipline policies. The Safe School Committee evaluates the plan annually and updates th
e plan as needed.

Professional Development at Powell is delivered through weekly early release day PLC 
meetings, monthly staff meetings, TEAL Integrated Arts trainings, 
and intensive PLC days for certain grade levels.  Based on our areas for growth as seen in our student data, our primary area
s of focus over the past three 
years have been on Rigorous Writin
g, Integrated Arts, and Best First Instruction practices.  Teachers are supported through class observations and 
feedback, Teachers on Special Assignment provide support for planning, and they participate in PLC data protocols.
 
 
The district 
annually holds professional development days in which teachers are offered a broad
-
based variety of professional learning opportunities in 
curriculum and instructional practice in support of a continuous cycle of improvement. Professional learning opportun
ities include grade level and/or 
content
-
specific programming on full and partial days as well as early student release day opportunities. Student achievement data co
ntinues to be the 
determining factor in the selection of professional learning topics. The
 
primary areas of focus for professional learning in the last three years have been 
in the area of supporting teachers as it relates to math, and ELA/ELD, history
-
social science, and science curricula, content standards, frameworks, as 
well as the use of s
tudent data to improve instructional practice. Professional learning is developed and facilitated by district staff, Teachers
 
on Special 
Assignment, as well as consultants and coaches who specialize in content
-
area pedagogy. Professional learning is struct
ured in job
-
embedded workshops 
and professional learning communities which include collaborative lesson planning, lesson study, classroom observations and c
oaching support, and 
student work/data analysis. Professional learning for all teachers includes str
ategies and pedagogy to support all learners access rigorous, grade
-
level 

nt of academic language 
and literacy.
 
 
Beginning in 2017 
through 2020, all teachers participated in six days of systematic, district
-
wide professional learning with a focus on instructional 
strategies in support of our three student success drivers: academic discourse, collaborative practices, and cognitive rigo
r. In addition, several opt
-
in days 
of various ongoing professional learning offerings were held to differentiate among grade and content levels and included sta
ndards
-
aligned instructional 
practices in support of all learners, including English learners a
nd students with disabilities; college and career readiness; and social
-
emotional support.
