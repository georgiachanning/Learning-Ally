School Mission Statement
 
 
We believe all students can be successful academically if we take the time to address their diverse learning needs, challenge
 
them and 
provide timely interventions for students below grade level. 
 
 
We believe in building a strong bond between the school, h
ome, and community to provide a web of support for all students to ensure 
their academic success. 
 
 
We believe we must address the whole child by providing an emotionally safe learning environment for each student as well as 
multiple 
opportunities for crea
tivity and enrichment. We are implementing Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) school climate 
program. 
 
 
Finally, we believe in honoring the diverse cultures that make up the mosaic of Belle Air and ensuring that the students who 
leave us
 
have 
the skills and social capital to be career and college ready and ultimately successful and contributing members of the larger
 
community.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities);

To promote a safe and 
caring school climate, the Belle Air School community provides students with support and strategies to treat each other with 
respect and in a caring manner. To that end, all staff members reinforce the Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (
PBIS) 
model and discuss and 
reinforce positive character traits. Students also are taught to use conflict
-
management skills to help work through problems with their peers. A system 
of guidelines on appropriate and inappropriate behavior includes yellow and blue 
slips with respective consequences. Suspension is always a last resort 
and is only for those infractions enumerated in the Education Code. A Climate Committee/PBIS consisting of teachers and the p
rincipal meet monthly to 
address schoolwide behavioral matte
rs such as PBIS, the implementation of the character traits and to plan the monthly Super Student Assembly. 2010
-
202 the PBIS team is attending the PBIS Tier 1 program offered by the SMCOE.
