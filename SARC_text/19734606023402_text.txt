Welcome to Walnut Elementary's annual School Accountability Report Card issued in accordance with Proposition 98 to 
fulfill 
state and federal disclosure requirements. The report contains valuable information about academic achievement, 
staff, instructional programs and materials, safety procedures, classroom environments, and our facilities.
 
 
School Description:
 
Walnut Elementa
ry School is a welcoming educational environment reflecting the 21st Century world in which we live.  We 
are one of nine elementary, three middle, and two comprehensive and one alternative high schools in the Walnut Valley 
Unified School District.  Walnut 
Elementary meets the needs of our 668 students through innovative and supportive 
instructional programs.  We were recognized by the state of California as a California Distinguished School.  Our teachers 
meet in Grade Level Collaboration teams to embed Com
mon Core State Standards to build strong reading, writing, and math 
skills in their students. Intervention teachers assist those requiring more support in these areas.  As a Title One school, D
ata 
Days are used to develop goals for individual students afte
r a extensive review of all student data.
 
 
The original Walnut Elementary School was constructed in 1892.  The present facility, constructed in 1971, underwent 
modernization in 2005.  The main building houses the administrative office, multipurpose room, h
ealth room, a workroom, 
a staff lounge, the Elementary Learning Specialist office, the school psychologist office and counseling office, the Title I 
Specialist office, and one conference room.  There are also four first grade classrooms, the school library
, and a technology 
lab with desktop computers.  The kindergarten area has six classrooms, including a TK through First Grade class for students 
identified as moderate to severe needs.  Seventeen second through fifth grade classrooms surround the quad in ad
dition to 
classrooms for Intervention, Speech and Language, and Specialized Academics.
 
 
We are proud that Walnut Elementary is the first and only elementary school in the district to have the Dual Language 
Immersion Program in Mandarin program.  We have 
two classes in all grade levels, Kindergarten through fifth.  Students are 
taught 50% of their day in English and the other 50% in Mandarin.
 
 
The K
-
5 student and staff population is a reflection of our ethnically diverse community.  The student populations
 
are divided 
as follows:  1% African
-
American, 62% Asian, 24% Hispanic, , 4% White, 4% Filipino, and 5% two or more races.  There are 
three significant subgroups with 26% are identified as socioeconomically disadvantaged, 18% are identified as English 
Lear
ners, and 7% are identified as students with disabilities.  Parent involvement is one of the major contributors to our 
school success.  Community Club, School Site Council, and English Learner Advisory Committee are some of the organizations 
in which paren
ts and families can be involved.  Parents, students, teachers, support staff, and administration work together 
in an atmosphere of mutual respect and cooperation.
 
 
Technology is embedded both in our classrooms and our professional environments.  Classrooms
 
have LCD projectors, 
document cameras, and desktop computers to enhance learning.  We have Chromebooks available for all grade levels.  Our 
kindergarten classes each have 6 Chromebooks and six iPads.  Currently, 25 Chromebooks are shared in Grade 1, 25 in
 
second, 25 are shared in Grade 3, 70 are shared in Grade 4, and Grade 5 also has a full class set of 35 Chromebooks.  In 
addition, each grade levels in first through fifth have an iPad cart to be used primarily for Project Lead the Way, but also 
for 
other
 
additional applications.  Our technology lab is used by all students, with online programs such as Mind Institute ST 
Math, Accelerated Reader, and other programs including StarFall and Imagine Learning.  Last year we received a Mobile 
Chromebook Lab cart 
of 35 Chromebooks from our Community Club to be shared with Grades first through fifth, and this 
year we have received a second mobile Chromebook cart.
 
 
We have continued supporting "Genius Hour" for students in grades three, four, and five.  Students choo
se among STEAM 
activities such as folk dance, gardening and agriculture, drama, computer coding, school newsletter, yoga, leadership, and 
much more.  All students receive physical education and academic art.  Fourth grade receives music and song flutes and
 
fifth graders may choose to join band or choir during school hours, and an after school choir is also available for all fourt
h 
and fifth grade students.  The STAR (Success Through Awareness and Resistance) Program, facilitated by a Sheriff Deputy, is 
prov
ided for all the fourth and fifth grade classes.  After school, fee
-
based programs include Symphonic Strings, Success 
through Chess, and Lego Engineering.  Third grade has a Folk Dance class one time a week for a ten week program, and it is 
connected to ou
r social science curriculum.  We will also be starting a second grade theatrical arts class in the second half 
of the school year.
 
 
Each morning our school starts off with some words of wisdom as well as the Pledge of Allegiance.  Announcements include 
soc
ial and emotional learning growth and development.  Students learn integrity, empathy, social responsibility, and many 
more attributes.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every sch
ool in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local e
ducational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Addition
ally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
