Principal's Message
 
C
onley School was built in 1913 and is located in South Taft, California. The neighborhood 
surrounding the school is in disrepair but our school building is an amazing historical building that 
houses hard working students and dedicated staff. Conley School is one of four primary schools in 
the Taft City School District. Conley serves approximate
ly 300 students on average in the 
kindergarten through third grades. The staff at Conley School is committed to meeting the needs 
of our students by providing an effective instructional program that bolsters their academic, social, 
physical, and emotional 
growth.  Our staff and volunteers are  dedicated to making every students' 
day the best it can be.  Tremendous changes have been implemented in the areas of curriculum 
planning, staff development, student assessment, and intervention.  Conley School  has t
he Teacher 
Induction Program as well as mentor support for our new teachers.  We have a strong group of 
teacher leaders in each grade level who support the implementation and development of our 
curriculum and testing.  Conley School is proud that we were t
he awarded the 2016 CA Honor Roll 
Award for students achievement on our state test scores.  Conley School is currently under 
construction.  Our Kindergarten remains on the main campus and our 1st

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a 
School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Loc
al Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with 
data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about th
e LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or t
he 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Taft City School District takes great effort to ensure that Conley School is clean, safe, and functional. To assist in 
this effort, Taft City School District 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public Construction and approved by the Stat
e Allocation Board. The results 
of this survey are available in the District or school offic
e.
 
 
Conley School is a safe place for students and staff. Before and after school supervision is available. All visitors must ent
er the front entrance and check
-
in using the RAPTO Visitor Management System . Staff is trained to alert the office of visitors
 

 
 
The school facility provides sufficient space for students and staff to have an adequate learning environment. The school pla
yground and general areas 
are checked and cleaned on a daily basis to ensure a clean and safe envi
ronment. Conley School has a full
-
time and part
-
time custodian. Maintenance 
services attend to the grounds and the building on a daily basis and repairs are completed in a timely manner.

During the spring of 2012, a school bond passed for improvements to 
Taft City School District. During the 2013
-
14 school year, Conley School received 
modernizing to the existing adult and student bathrooms.  An adult bathroom was added and the new bathrooms meet ADA standard
s. The District also 
completed a district wide Ph
oto Voltaic project in which roof mounted solar panels and solar paneled  shade structures were installed on Conley's campus.
 
In 2016, many student desks were replaced with new ones and the stage was outfitted with new drapes. In summer of 2017, the S
afe R
outes to Schools 
made some improvements to one of the walking routes to and from school.  Additionally, crosswalks were improved and safety si
gnage was added. The 
student beds in the nurses' office have been reupholstered. Our school site is currently unde
rgoing improvements to our handicap ramps entering and 
exiting the building, fire alarm system and lighting.  We plan to return to our site when construction is complete in winter 
2020.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: P

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarte
r Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible s
tudents 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Parents of Conley Stu

 
Council (SSC), and the English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC). The PTO offers parents a way to become involved in fundrai
sing 
for student activities 
and special events. Meetings are held about every 6 weeks and all parents are sent notices of invite. . The SSC helps to cons
truct our School Plan and is 
an advisory board made up of the principal, teachers, parents, and community me
mbers. This group meets almost monthly. We have Parent Conferences 
two times a year and Student Assistance Meetings regularly. Additionally, parents are invited to school events such as awards
 
assemblies, kindergarten 
graduation, special days(Pioneer Day),
 
and field trips.
 
 
The ELAC serves our Spanish speaking parents; the principal, teachers, and parents serve on this committee. This committee is
 
also an advisory board 
and addresses special concerns for Spanish speaking students. Meetings are held almost m
onthly.  At the District level we have DELAC and District 
Advisory Committee.
 
 
parents are encouraged to participate in their child's learning through communicating with their child's teacher.  Many teach
ers use online resources to 
make communication easy.
  
Additionally, parents are encouraged to volunteer in the classroom and with special events.
 
 
For more information on how to become involved with the school, please contact Lisa Kindred, Principal, at: (661) 765

School Safety Plan
 
Conley School provides an 
environment that is safe and nurturing. School personnel supervise all school activities closely. We have staff on duty befor
e 
school at 7:45 and after school as well as coverage at ASES till 6:00. We teach and consistently enforce safety procedures fo
r th
e playground, classrooms, 
and all other areas. All visitors enter through the SECURE main entrance and all gates remain locked throughout the day. The 
main doors to the school 
are secure.  Parents and visitors ring a doorbell and be buzzed in to the buildi
ng.  Additionally, a camera is positioned for the staff to see who is entering 
the building. The main office clears all campus visitors through the RAPTOR Visitor Management System, and staff members imme
diately report the 
arrival of any unidentified perso
n on the school premises. All staff members, substitute personnel, and visitors wear identification badges.  Additionally, 
the school staff is provided with a District Safety Handbook detailing procedures for action in the event of an unsafe event.
 
We have
 
monthly fire drills 
and bi
-
annual earthquake and lockdown drills.  The most recent meeting on the school safety plan was held in August of 2019, preserv
ice day, for staff.
