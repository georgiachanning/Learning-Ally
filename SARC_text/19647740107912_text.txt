About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

We choose our textbooks from lists that have already been approved by state education official
s. For a list of some of the textbooks we use at our school, 
see the Data Almanac that accompanies this report.
 
 
We have also reported additional facts about our textbooks called for by the Williams legislation of 2004. This online report
 
shows whether we 
had a 
textbook for each student in each core course during the 2013

2014 school year and whether those textbooks covered the California Content Standards.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our school is ten years old. The buildings are in fair condition. Some repairs would benefit the school. We strive to keep th
e buildings clean and ready 
for student learning. Restrooms are monitored by
 
custodians and cleaned on a regular basis/or as needed. In addition, our campus monitors are 
monitoring the restrooms during recess times. A new exit gate was added last school year to create additional exit options fo
r students.
 
 
Additional storage space
 
for equipment and supplies would be an asset to the school. Currently, the multipurpose room is used to store equipment and 
materials.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for 
by the Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical sys
tems, heating and ventilation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is t
o determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for
 
this assessment were written 
by the Office
 
of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the six

Tool used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parent involvement takes on many roles at Helen Keller. Parents are given the opportunity to learn study skills to assist the
ir children in English language 
arts and math.They are actively involved in all school advis
ory councils (e.g. Chair and Co
-
Chair), school
-
wide assemblies, parent volunteer program, 
extracurricular activities (e.g. coach
-
folkloric dance group, track and field), office and library assistant.
 
 
Parents are also provided an opportunity to assist teac
hers in their child's classrooms. We have a community liaison that assist parents with  a variety of 
needs they may have concerning their child's academic, social, and emotional progress. Parents participate in a parent teache
r organization (PTO).

School Safety Plan
 
Student safety when t
raveling to school or  home is of the utmost concern for staff and parents. We ensure  safety on campus by locking all exit g
ates by 
8:45 am. All gates are monitored by  campus employees.  Parents have to enter through the school office where they are aske
d for picture 
identification.Emergency equipment is maintained on the campus. Teachers and staff review their specific emergency plan annua
lly by establishing safety 
protocols that are communicated to staff, parents, and students. Monthly emergency drills 
are held quarterly at the school.  A safety protocol was sent 
home to all parents to review. The grounds are monitored daily by the principal, the custodians, and the campus monitors thro
ughout the day.  Emergency 
contact cards are updated each school year
 
for every student. Emergency phone numbers and student addresses are updated when needed.Parent 
Volunteers assist staff at dismissal to support student safety. The school safety plan was updated by a team of staff members
 
and on January 27, 2017 
and appro
ved by the School Site Council team members.
