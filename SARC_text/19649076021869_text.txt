Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP
] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eigh
t and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant c
ognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Many 
individuals and groups provide support for the educational program at Kellogg Polytechnic Elementary School. 
Parents as members of Kellogg's school committees sponsored school fundraising events, classroom volunteer program 
and promote improved academic ac
hievement in the community. Some of the current groups we have at Kellogg where 
parents can get involved are the School Site Council, ELAC, and Title I parent groups. We also have formal and informal 
parent volunteers. The School Site Council is composed o
f parents and school staff and meets monthly to coordinate 
school program improvement. Many local businesses and individuals enrich our school program through direct donations 
of goods and services. Students also benefit from a significant number of parent
 
volunteers who share their special talents 
working in the classroom, planning special activities, and organizing other parents to help with school activities.
 
 
Some of the ways our parents are involved besides the formal committees are:
 

 
ELD Classes taught
 
by Cal Poly students to our Kellogg Parents
 

 
Cake Decorating Classes
 

 
Monthly Workshops around topics the parents are interested in such as: Diabetes, CPR, and Mental Health to 
name a few
 

 
The Kellogg Parent Garden Group
 

 
Parents help with school activities s
uch as: Winter Store, Read Across America, Day of the Child, Teacher 
Appreciation, and the Kellogg Community Yard Sales
 
 
 
Parents are an integral part of Kellogg Polytechnic Elementary School. The School Site Council, which is comprised of 
parents and staf
f members, develops the staff development programs through the Academic Plan for Student 
Achievement. We have 3 to 5 parent representatives as members of the District Advisory Council and the District ELAC 
and The  Parent Lead. Parent education is offered 
in technology and other classes that arise through parent requests, such 
as parenting classes, health, or disaster preparedness. Kellogg Polytechnic Elementary School has an Academic School Plan 
which addresses the strengths and weaknesses of the overall s
chool program. In addition, every four years, a Categorical 
Program Monitoring is conducted at each school.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety: Safety of the students and staff is a primary concern of the Pomona Unified School District. All schools in the distr
ict 
are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations 
pertaining to hazardous materials. Staff attended a training on 
October 10, 2014 and a disaster preparedness plan is in place for earthquakes and emergency evacuations and is reviewed 
annually. We have a Disaster Committee at Kellogg that is comprised of t
eachers, other staff and administration that 
meets after the Great Shake Out to debrief and plan next steps and revise anything in the disaster plan that needs to be 
updated. We hold practice drills to ensure that our staff and students are prepared and kn
ow the procedures outlined in 
the Disaster Plan. All buildings within the district are in compliance with state earthquake standards. A discipline policy 
may be found at each school that seeks to insure a safe and orderly environment for students and staff
. A Safe School Plan 
has been adopted, and it includes policies on disaster preparedness, student discipline, the components of a safe and 
orderly school environment, suspension/expulsion procedures, safety, child abuse reporting procedures, student dress 
codes, and student and staff sexual harassment.
