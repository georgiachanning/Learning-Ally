School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., 
California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/
literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California St
ate University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Stanford Avenue School is in the city of Oroville.  Because Oroville is a small rural community, there has been an allowance 
for one district Safety Plan to be developed.  A Crisis Response Plan provides the school 
administration a structure and 
direction when an emergency exists with disaster procedures that may include evacuation, lock
-
down, or other urgent 
needs.
 
 
Along with the district safety plan, there has been an analysis of Stanford's safety needs by a team 
of local and state 
leaders.  The team developed a plan that covers a range of ways to better support school safety.  For extra safety, Stanford 
added extra fencing in the student pick up area and has implemented more traffic controls.

Stanford Avenue school strives to reach each student with differentiated instruction and to do so we use small group 
instruction as well as other programs. First of all we have instructional aides in all of our Kindergarten classes for 3 hour
s 
each morning
. Additionally, we also support 1
-
3 grade with a shared instructional aide at each grade level. The grade level 
teams determine how to share the instructional aide in an equitable way.
 
 
Our site also uses i
-
Ready, which is a computer based diagnostic and a
ssigns lessons according to each student's individual 
needs. i
-
Ready is used to supplement for ELA and Math instruction.Teachers can track data, retrieve student reports, and 
provide additional target individual or small group lessons as needed. Other comp
uter based assistance programs include 
Lexia and MobyMax.

19 School Accountability Report Card for Stanford Avenue School

Stanford Avenue School has committed to the emphasis on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) 
with an emphasis on Wellness (Healthy Habits) and Environment (Recycling). Through the lens of WE STEM, the 
Common 
Core State Standards (CCSS) and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) will be a primary focus for student 
learning. In order to be successful in our efforts to implement WE STEM, Stanford Avenue School is applying five research
-
based best pra
ctices that have guided successful elementary STEM schools.  These practices include; leadership as the 
driver for change, professional capacity among teachers, a student
-
centered learning climate, strong ties to parents and 
community, and instructional gu
idance for teachers.
 
 
All students at Stanford Avenue Elementary School are provided with the textbooks and related materials for math, 
language arts, health, science, and social studies.  A continued focus will be on the continued implementation of CCSS a
nd 
NGSS school
-
wide.  The District has provided professional development for the understanding of CCSS for every teacher 
in the district.  The District supports District grade level meetings where teachers facilitate professional growth around 
Common Core 
State Standards.  Teachers are being guided in implementation of formative assessments as well as some 
teachers attending professional development around formative assessments. Time has been set aside an hour a week for 
grade level collaboration at the sch
ool site. The structured meetings support the Professional Learning Community (PLC).  
Grade level teachers discuss student achievement and strategies to address the CCSS and NGSS needs. Students may be 
given support as needed, avoiding getting stuck in int
erventions all year as a placement versus a specific service. Other 
professional develop for Stanford teachers and staff this year will include Trauma Informed Training and Nurtured Heart 
Approach training. These focus on giving the teachers the knowledge 
and skills needed to meet the needs of student 
coming to us with trauma and how to recognize and support students social emotional needs.
 
 
IReady, a district intervention for all students in Reading and Math has been implemented regularly.  Data is analyze
d each 
trimester to determine progress made towards CCSS needs and evaluate students with Tier 2 and Tier 3 intervention 
needs.We have improved our RTI system this school year with the inclusion of a push in model for our resource students. 
Special educati
on instructional aides are in general education classes during RTI times to lead small groups in interventions 
for students who qualify based on assessment results.  Our resource students are leaving the general education classroom 
less and the added exper
tise of our aides has increased flexibility to our program and service to our students.  Our system 
is in a consistent state of improvement and revision as we look at student results and provide the necessary instruction to 
improve student learning.  Stude
nts may require a few extra tutoring lessons or small group instruction focusing on a 
specific skill that may be exited from their interventions in one to two weeks.  Students with more severe needs require 
more formal and intensive groupings that typicall
y are assessed at the end of six weeks. Depending on the level of 
intervention needed will determine when students are assessed formally and exited from interventions. PBIS is another 
tool we are using. We are developing a culture of positive behavior thro
ugh student recognition and Tier 1 & 2 behavior 
interventions. While Tier 1 is universal, Tier 2 is more targeted. Data is tracked suing the SWIS data system. The goal is to
 
keep our interventions and continue to fine tune them in order to meet the needs o
f our students.
