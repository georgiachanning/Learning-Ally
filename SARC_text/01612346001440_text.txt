By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Schilling was constructed in five phases between 1960 and 2003.  In 1996, 
the voters approved a bond measure to enhance 

-
2007, 
the POD building was remodeled to house nine classrooms, resource areas and a new offic
e.  School facilities are safe and 
district maintenance personnel ensure that minor maintenance, repairs or upgrades are performed to keep the facility in 
good repair.  With the passing of the bond and Prop 39, the District have begun assessing all site to
 
address concerns.
 
District maintenance staff ensures that minor maintenance, repairs or upgrades necessary to keep the school in good 
repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. Monthly inspections are performed which includes general, 
elec
trical, mechanical and playground safety. A work order system is used to ensure efficient service and emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority.
 
The school has two full time custodians and one part time custodian, including a senior day custodian as
 
well as a night 
custodian. Custodial staff work year round to maintain a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.

The Schilling staff updates, reviews, and discusses 
their safety procedures in September of each school year. Practice drills 
take place regularly during the school year on a monthly basis and a wide scale disaster drill is implemented each year in 
the spring.  The school safety committee meets monthly to p
lan and support the implementation of the School Safety 
Plan. The Newark Police Department has also trained our staff and is working with the safety committee to 
revise/modify/and improve the safety plan. The police department will also train our parents o
n the drills and be a visible 
presence during drills and on action items related to the school safety plan.  The plan is updated annually and reviewed 
and approved by the School Site Council. Staff members then review the updated safety plan to ensure comm
on 
understanding and consistent implementation.  Additionally, Schilling has implementing PBIS (Positive Behavior 
Intervention & Supports). PBIS is a proactive approach to establishing the behavioral supports and social culture needed 
for all students to a
chieve social, emotional, and academic success.

Professional development and teacher evaluation promote quality instruction and is a fundamental element in developing 
a 
sound educational program. Staff members build teaching skills and concepts through participating in conferences, 
workshops, and cross site, site and grade level collaboration as well as various training throughout the academic year. All 
first and second y
ear teachers throughout the district participate in the Induction Program.  The teacher evaluation 

Evaluations and formal observations are design

criteria and Newark Unified School District policies. Temporary and probationary teachers are evaluated annually and 
tenured teachers are evaluated every other year. Teacher evaluations
 
are conducted by the school principal and ensure 
that teachers are engaging and supporting all students in learning, understanding and organizing subject matter for 
student learning, assessing student learning, creating and maintaining effective environme
nts for student learning, 
planning instruction and implementing effective learning experiences.
 
 
Schilling teachers participated in a variety of ongoing professional development opportunities focused on effective 
instruction in English Language Arts, Mathe

professional development to support the implementation of Common Core State Standards, Readers' Workshop, DRA2, I 
Ready, Writers Workshop, Data Teams., STEAM Program, Maker Spa
ce,  and Positive Behavior Intervention System (PBIS).  
The areas of professional development are determined through extensive analysis of student performance data and also 
in alignment with district wide initiatives.
