Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Beryl Heights School, founded in 1909, is located in South Redondo Beach. Beryl provides a disciplined learning climate 
for all students. Students, parents, and staff are encouraged to learn and work together, to take risk
s, and to stretch 
themselves beyond their expectations. Staff members support and encourage students, parents, and each other to accept 
and find the best in themselves and others. Beryl is a place where everyone learns and everyone teaches. An atmosphere 
o

feedback, implementation support, and encouragement.  Everyone takes responsibility for ensuring that each student and 
adult reaches his
 
or her full potential. Students are challenged, supported, and encouraged to set goals and take risks. 
There is a "can
-
do" attitude present in classrooms. A strong partnership between home, school, and community exists 
that recognizes in order for the sch
ool to be successful, each child must be successful. Following the six pillars of character 
is the way we approach students to make sure they are caring, responsible, respectful, fair, and trustworthy students. The 
school sees itself as one entity rather t
han individual classrooms. Everyone is dedicated to doing whatever it takes to 
ensure that each student is prepared to be the teachers, leaders, and dreamers of tomorrow.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement 
(Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate As
sessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement stan
dards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the Uni
versity of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The Redondo Beach Unified School District is focusing staff professional development (PD) in three main areas: effective 
instructional strategies aligned to California State Standards at schools sites; use of technology in instruction; and the 
supporting o
f the social, emotional, and behavioral needs of all students, particularly through the implementation of 
Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS) in all schools. While the current PD does focus on instructional and 
curriculum in mathematics, E
nglish, and science, the RBUSD is also developing PD for History Social Science standards.
 
 
The RBUSD is engaged in a multi
-
layered approach to delivering PD. The District provides PD through: teacher release 
time; conference attendance; one
-
day workshops;
 
mentoring; book studies; and after
-

elementary schools utilize weekly collaborative planning time through the implementation of a School Instructional 
Leadership Team and grade level leads.
 
 
Targeted teacher 
development activities are essential for increasing the quality of education to students. The below topics 
are a few of the professional development areas for this school year:
 

 
Reading strategies and understanding text complexity
 

 
MTSS and Tier 2 Interventi
on Strategies
 

 
Supporting students with disabilities through inclusive practices and co
-
teaching
 

 
Grade level articulation
 

 
Professional Learning Communities (PLCs)
 

 
Student mental health
 

 
Suicide prevention
 

 
Mastery Learning
 

 
Examination of student 
assessment results
 
The use of student data is critical to better assess and support individual student development. The District provides 
training on our student data management, Performance Matters, to analyze individual and aggregate student progress. 
El
ementary teachers and secondary math teachers receive ongoing training and support on diagnosing students learning 
targets and adjusting instruction to increase number sense.
 
 
Internal PD offerings are supplemented by partnering with external professional 
development organizations, including 

teachers and administration on instructional programs for all students.
 
 
Our new teachers are supported at 
school sites and at the District level through the Beginning Teacher Support and 
Assessments (BTSA) Program where each new teacher is mentored by a BTSA support provider. By working with BTSA, a 
new teacher receives support and resources to improve their t
eaching pedagogy.
 
 
Through the collective bargaining process, additional paid professional development days are included in the teacher work 
calendar.
