By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan was developed for Stratford School in collaboration with local agencies and 
District administration to fulfill Senate Bill 187 requirements. Components of this plan include child
 
abuse reporting 
procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe arrival 
and department from school, sexual harassment policy, dress code policy, and bully prevention policy.  The most curre
nt 
school site safety plan is reviewed annually and any changes or modifications are presented to the School Board by March. 
Annually, the plan is also reviewed,  discussed, and shared with school staff in September 2018 at a staff meeting. 
Components of t
he School Site Safety Plan were discussed at monthly staff meetings throughout the school year.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff 
Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Central Union School District combines efforts to provide training and curriculum development based on the California 
Standards which are aligned to the content of the curriculum frameworks for grades kindergarten through eight. Teachers 
within the Distric
t align classroom curriculum to ensure that all students either meet or exceed state proficiency levels. 
 
 


to focus on the Prof
essional Learning Communities (PLC). Grade Level Teams have worked to identify Essential Standards 
Districtwide to ensure that all students are achieving. The District continues to partner with Solution Tree to support our 
learning community process throug
h training and coaching for our educators. 
 
 
A Multi
-
Tiered System of Support (MTSS) Leadership Team was developed during the 2017
-
18 school year, and continues 
to be instrumental presently. This group began with a focus on the Social
-
Emotional and Behavio
ral needs of students. 
Based on their findings, they provided training on Connectedness to administrators and staff. An ongoing needs 
assessment was conducted at each site to provide information for next steps. Over time, we can expect to see continued 
imp
rovement in school culture as well as student achievement as a result of this research
-
based practice. 
 
 
Central partners with local County Offices of Education and content experts to provide staff training and coaching to 
support the full implementation a
nd sustainability of State Standards. This year, they included:
 

 
Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)
 

 
21st Century Teaching & Learning Capacity Building
 

 
English Language Development
 
Just as teachers differentiate for their students, the District strives
 
to differentiate learning for staff. To that end, it hosts 
several optional trainings each year as well as providing opportunities for staff to attend trainings outside the District. 
Teachers chose to attend those that best meet their needs for personal p
rofessional growth. Optional Trainings for 2017
-
18 focused on Student Engagement through the use of Collaboration and Cooperative Strategies in the classroom.

g skills improvement, First Aid/ 
CPR, English Learners, Technology and Reading Mastery. Classified staff acquire job

Newly credentialed and/or beginning teachers receive training on assessment, individualized support, integration of 
instructional technology, and advanced content from the California Teacher Induction Program which is the preferred 
pathway to a California 
Professional (Clear) Teaching Credential. The Teacher Induction Program is co
-
administered by the 
California Department of Education (CDE) and the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC). The Teacher 
Induction Task Force and State Leadership 
Team provide support and technical assistance to local Teacher Induction 
Program leaders. The Teacher Induction program provides standards
-
based, individualized advice and assistance that 
combines the application of theory learned in the preliminary teache
r preparation program with mentor
-
based support 
and formative assessment feedback. 
 
 
Sites also differentiate for staff based on the needs of their site, providing training through Staff Meetings, Instructional
 
Aides Meetings and additional site profession
al development including such topics as:
 

 
Math Model & Coaching
