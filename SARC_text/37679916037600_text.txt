By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
 
The District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and 
functional. To assist in this effort, the District 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. This survey was 
completed on 05/09/2019 and is available at the Facilities, Maintenance and Oper
ations office.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Facilities Description
 
This school has 12 permanent classr
ooms, one portable classroom, a library, a multipurpose room, and an administration 
building. The main campus was built in 1956 with additions made in 1978 and 1988. The school was modernized in 2002; 
the multipurpose room was built in 1999.

Maintenance
 
and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given th
e highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The school is cleaned every other night by a district cleaning crew. Work performed includes: sweeping, vacuuming, and 
mopping floors, emptying trash, cleaning sinks, filling dispensers, and dusting rooms,
 
as scheduled. Grounds are 
maintained by District groundskeeping staff. There is one full
-
time day custodian. The day custodian is responsible for 
daily restroom cleaning, cleaning eating and food preparation areas, daily grounds clean up, minor facility r
epairs, and 
special emergency clean ups. Carpets are shampooed and tile flooring is cleaned and refinished every winter, spring, and 
summer break. A thorough deep cleaning of all areas is done every summer. District administration works daily with 
custodia
l and grounds supervisors to ensure a clean, safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The District allocates funds for completion of deferred maintenance projects which consist of major repair or replacement 
of existing school building components. Typical
ly, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior paint, and floor systems..

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
incl
udes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. 
Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilitie
s); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
