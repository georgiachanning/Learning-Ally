By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Westside Elementary is
 
a small rural one school (Prek
-
8) district located in the western part of Fresno County. Westside 
Elementary is approximately forty
-
five minutes southwest of the city of Fresno. The surrounding areas are predominately 
ranches and acres of farmland with ma
ny Mexican immigrants providing the labor force behind the agricultural operations. 
Westside Elementary School provides educational services to the many children from those Mexican immigrant families.  
The school district strives to meet the many needs of 
the children, as well as provide enriching experiences. Our basic 
services include a free breakfast and lunch for all students and bus transportation to all of the outlying ranches. We are 
also a magnet for groups wishing to donate food, clothing, and scho
ol supplies to our students and their families. Westside 
Elementary School consists of a Superintendent/Principal, a vice
-
principal/programs director, a school secretary, and 
district business staff, twelve classroom teachers, one resource specialist, one 
English Language Development 
teacher/instructional coach.
 
 
The teachers are assisted by six instructional aides. In addition, there is a State Preschool on site.
 
 
Westside Elementary is committed to providing enriching, educational field trips for our 
students. These include the 
Fresno Chaffee Zoo, Big Fresno Fair, and Riverdale Pumpkin Patch and Ag Days for the Primary Grades. While progressing 
through grades 4
-
8, each student will at some time have the opportunity to visit Mission San Juan Bautista, R
egional 
Learning Center/"Five Mile Camp" in Sonora, Camp Ocean Pines in Cambria, the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and the Youth 
Educational Services in Disneyland. The students also have many other opportunities to experience other enrichment 
activities, such as
 
riding the Amtrak to visit the Train Museum on Old Town Sacramento. Westside Elementary School also 
provides numerous reward incentives for students as well. As rewards for academic accomplishments (Honor Roll), and 
Positive Behavior ("WILD"), students ca
n attend trips and programs that include trips to Artes America Case de Cultura, 
bowling, Fresno State Downing Planetarium, and Fresno Grizzlies Make the Grade. Westside Elementary School is also 
committed to the parents of the many students we serve. The 
school has developed an instructional English program for 
the parents within the district wanting to learn English. The school has purchased the Rosetta Stone program for the 
parents wanting to learn English. A district employee is currently leading a grou
p of twenty
-
five parents every Monday for 
two hours in the evening, in addition, the district also provides childcare for those parents needing childcare in the school
's 
library. Westside Elementary School is continually providing services, programs, and e
nrichment activities for the many 
students and families it serves to better ensure the opportunities for success.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in 
the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of 
the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully complet
ed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Westside Elementary School revises the school safety plan yearly. Parents may obtain a copy of the plan by
 
visiting the 
district office; a copy is readily available. The safety plan encompasses any sudden, unanticipated events that profoundly 
and negatively affects a significant segment of the school population and often involves serious injury or death (such 
as 
earthquakes, fires, intruders, suicide and suicide risk, and physical attack). The plan includes identifying what is a crisis
, 
who is in charge, procedures for general crisis intervention, training for the safety team, a phone tree, designated school 
si
te and alternative sites if needed, recordkeeping forms, and special safety codes. Westside also utliizes The Blackboard 
for mass information distributiuion.
 
 
The school safety plan was last reviewed, updated and discussed with the school faculty in Septem
ber 2018.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff 
Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Westside Elementary has provided opportunities for all teachers to attend various professional
-
development activities 
during the school year. Professional development for our HMH Reading/Language Arts program, 
"Journey's", "Collections"  
and Escalate English. Professional development will include continued training in this curriculum for teachers who have 
experienced the first year with it, as well as for the new teachers. Professional Development will continue 
in math, as well 
as student engagement strategies, and the roll out of the Next Generantion Science Standards 
-
 
for which our plan calls 
for purchasing additional supplies and materials in order to make science truly hands
-
on, STEM based. Finally, new Soci
al 
Studies Standards and Frameworks will begin to be introduced by the state, and we will set aside time for introducing 
teachers to those as well. Teachers are encouraged to attend Fresno County Office of Education workshops and in
-
services, Cullinan Educ
ation Center and High Point training. Westside Elementary devotes three days during each school 
year to staff development. Also, every first and third Tuesday are early release days. Teachers meet for grade
-
level 
discussion, and the vice principal schedule
s FCOE presenters in different areas of need.
