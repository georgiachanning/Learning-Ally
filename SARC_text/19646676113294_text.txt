Our school

wide theme is focused on our college and career bound Tigers!  This theme is supported 
through our growing AVID progra

courses in all grade levels.  (AVID, Advancement Via Individual Determination, is sponsored by both 
district and site funding.)  In addition to our AVID electives, we also provide a variety o

order to provide students with options as they pursue their personal best each day.  AVID gives 
support in the areas of writing, inquiry, collaboration, organization, reading, note

receive additional support from college tutors during their AVID elective class 3 times a week.
 
 
These additional electives include, AVID EXCEL (supports EL learners with language acquisition), 
STEM classes
 
(focusing on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), Band, PLUS (Peer 
Leaders Uniting Students), Band, Choir, Guitar, Art, Spanish I, Spanish II, Yearbook, Computer 
Literacy, Guided Study Hall, and Teacher Aide. Many of our students take advan
tage of extra and 
co
-
curricular activities on campus including sports, Campus Counselor Time, Robotics, GATE classes 
and enrichment activities, and CJSF (California Junior Scholastic Federation).
 
 
We are committed to the continual refinement of our electiv
es in order to further enhance the 
academic and extracurricular programs at NVMS so that all students are proud to call themselves 
Tigers as we support their unique abilities to attend college and pursue the career of their dreams.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every 
school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all loca
l educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Addit
ionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https:/
/www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, 
parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
General
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the Los Angeles County Office
 
of Education. The results of this survey are available at the school office or at the district office.
 
 
School Buildings
 
New Vista Middle was established in 1989 on a temporary site and moved to their current site in 1994. The main building house
s the fro
nt, health, and 


28 that are permanent and 24 that are re
-
locatable. We have 
4 science labs, 2 computer labs and a gym.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance
 
staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner
. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Pr
ocess and Schedule
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is 
available at the district office. 
The Supervisor of Operations works daily with the custodial staff to develop c
leaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
Although the State no longer requires a Deferred Maintenance contribution, Lancaster School District is still dedicated to ma
intaining the facilities for 
our students.  These expenditures would include but not be limited to roofing, plumbing, heating, air 
conditioning, electrical, painting, and flooring.  For 
the 2019
-
20 school year, the district has budgeted $940,000 for deferred maintenance projects.
 
 
New Construction
 
Security doors for the front entry to the school were installed in 2019.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
