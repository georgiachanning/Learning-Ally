Description
 
 
Hello Marshall  Family,
 
Over the years, I have met many of you and look forward to continue building a strong relationship 
in the upcoming year. This year all of our teachers are focused on developing positive relationship 
skills with all stud
ents. We will be working hard to create an environment where students will be 
able to feel safe, learn from their mistakes, and take risks to increase their opportunity for academic 
success.  We also want all of our students to become enthusiastic readers.
 
All of our students visit 
the library and dedicate time to make a good book choice. We ask that families make a reading a 
priority at home in order to grow vocabulary and comprehension skills. We need your support and 
involvement in helping make 2019
-
2020
 
a successful and fulfilling school year for your child!
 
 
We believe that all students are R.O.C.K. Stars. (Responsible, Optimistic, Cooperative, Kind and 
Scholarly).

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

We choose our textbooks from lists that have already been approved by state education officials. For a list of some of the te
xtbooks we use at our school, 
see the Data Almanac that accompanies this report.
 
 
We have also reported additional facts a
bout our textbooks called for by the Williams legislation of 2004. This online report shows whether we had a 
textbook for each student in each core course during the 2013

2014 school year and whether those textbooks covered the California Content Standards

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Thurgood Marshall Elementary School was built in 2007. Our custodial staff and maintenance personnel take great pride in main
taining our school 
facilities, classrooms, restrooms, and school grounds. In 2012 Marshall received a new playground for students t
o enjoy.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the
 
Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their s
tructural integrity, electrical systems, heating and ventilation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good
 
repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identif
ies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for this assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the si

Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca

The

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental

parents are an important 

g collaboratively with parents and the surrounding community to bring about 
student success. We strongly believe that success is the result of the entire school community working collaboratively to hel
p facilitate student 
achievement.
 
 
This year we started
 
a parent volunteer program that allows our parents to volunteer as a campus monitor and a classroom assistant. Parents partic
ipated 
in a one
-
day training. This program allows our parents and teachers to learn and work together for our goal: student succes
s.
 
 
Various parent classes are offered at Thurgood Marshall. We also hold an ESL Class for our community parents. This class is h
eld twice a week.
 
 
Marshall has two parent councils; School Site Council (SSC) and English Learner Advisory Council (ELAC).  Du
ring the meetings, parents and community 
members are updated on our academic programs as well as receive mini
-
training's on how to help their child at home in ELA and Math. Parents voice 
their concerns and give input as it relates to the success of our stu

on many occasions are asked to help in and outside of the classrooms.
 
 
We also have a Parent
-
 
Teacher Organization (PTO) that gives parents that opportunity to fund raise 
and coordinate student based school activities. 
Despite it's size, our Parent Center offers the use of two computers, printer and relevant school and community parent inform
ation. At Marshall, we 
value parent involvement and encourage all parents to volunt
eer in and out of the classroom.
 
 
Communication in English and Spanish is given to parents and the community via Aeries communication, monthly calendars, newsl
etters, flyers, and 
school website.  Please stay connected with us and follow us on Facebook (@Ly
nwoodMarshallElementary) and Instagram (@Thurgood Marshall

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Thurgood Marshall Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for all stakeholders. A school wide Code of Conduct an
d classroom expectations 
are in place that promote respect, cooper
ation, courtesy, and acceptance of others. Thurgood Marshall Elementary School is a closed campus. However, 
parents and community members are welcomed to visit our school. All visitors must sign
-
 
in at the front office and wear identification badges while 
on 
school grounds. During recess, lunch, breaks and before school, campus monitors, teachers, and administration monitor the cam
pus to ensure student 
safety. At the end of the school day, teachers escort students to designated pick
-
up areas for dismissal.
 
 
We have developed a Safety Committee that annually reviews our Safety Plan.  This Safety Plan is revised annually or as neces
sary to ensure it contains 
current information needed to maintain the safety of all students, staff members, parents and community
 
members on campus.We will continue to have 
review training that  address school
-
wide Active Shooter, fire drill and earthquake drills provided by our local sheriff station and school personnel.  Every 
teacher has an emergency kit that contains medical sup
plies and water. This kit also contains a tarp and a portable toilet.
 
 
Thurgood Marshall Elementary School conducts monthly drills to prepare for unforeseen emergencies. These drills ensure that a
ll students and staff are

safest and quickest routes to vacate classrooms and office buildings. Our safety plan contains information regarding procedur

documentation needed in the event of a safety concern.
