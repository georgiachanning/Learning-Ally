By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Troth Street Elementary has approximately 740 students, including two preschool classes and a special day class (SDC) 
that has been incorporated into an inclusion class.  Troth is located in a rural setting of single
-
family homes an
d small 
businesses.  We are proud to serve a diverse population.
 
 
Our educational programs are based on Common Core State Standards and guided by data analysis.  Our dedicated staff 
participates in on
-
going professional staff development to guide and build
 
on best practices.  We provide differentiated 
instruction for all students, including at
-
promise students, English Learners, special education (inclusion), and Gifted and 
Talented Education (GATE).  We have also adopted AVID practices as we work together 
to ensure our students receive the 
best opportunities.  Our Troth Street staff is dedicated to maintaining a dynamic learning environment which supports 
and ensures our students achieve and reach their highest potential.
 
 
The mission of the district is to 
educate each student to the highest level of academic achievement and prepare students 
to succeed in life.  Our goals at Troth Street as in all Jurupa USD schools include: developing an environment that is 
physically and emotionally safe that promotes posi
tive character traits. Goals also include that parents and the community 
actively participate in positive school and/or learning experiences.  Our goal is that all students experience measurable 
success in any program, increase the number of students eligi
ble for college and other post secondary options, increase 
the quality of interaction between teachers and students, and learn to live and work in a culturally diverse society where 
staff is representative of the cultures in the community.  This philosophy
 
along with parent partnerships ensure we 
develop a supportive culture in which all students Learn without Limits to become productive members of our diverse 
society.

Jurupa Unified School 
District conducts an evaluation of instructional materials to adopt materials that best meet the 
needs of students. The district conducts adoptions on a districtwide basis. The review process includes a committee of a 
majority of classroom teachers in the 
appropriate discipline (Education Code Section 60210). In addition, all instructional 
materials are in compliance with social content standards. When making adoption decisions, the adoption committee uses 
the content standards, the curriculum frameworks, t
he State Board of Education
-
adopted evaluation criteria, and the 
reports on each adoption as resources. The final decision for selecting and recommending textbook adoptions is with the 
adoption committee. The most recently adopted textbooks were selected f
rom the state
-
approved list.

Parent 
involvement is highly encouraged at Troth Street Elementary.  Parent advisory groups are in place and meet 
regularly throughout the school year to give parents an opportunity to be involved.  Advisory groups include SSC, GATE, 
Title I, and ELAC parent meet
ings.  In addition, students and families at Troth are provided access to community resources 
through a wide range of services.  Students who require additional support and assistance may participate in the district's 
Student Assistance Program, School and
 
Community Outreach, or our Troth Street Student Study Team.
 
 
The following include programs designed for parents and/or staff to continue to support parental involvement 
opportunities:  parent
-
teacher conferences, translation services during meetings, Par
ent Involvement Policy (Title I), 
Parent/Teacher/Student Compact (Title I), Academic Progress Reports, teacher phone calls, Remind text messages, Back 
To School Night, parent training with technology devices, AVID parent meetings, parent/student handbook, 
community 
volunteers, bulletins in English and Spanish to inform parents of events, Family Literacy, and parent broadcast messages 
are all tools used to encourage and promote our parental involvement opportunities. All communication to parents is in 
Englis
h and Spanish.  This year we will also include parent opportunities to be a part of the HERO presentation for parents 
as we work as partners. Continuing to build parental involvement opportunities is key as we work together to ensure our 
students thrive.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Troth Street School in accordance with Senate Bill 187, has safe school strategies that include information on the status 
of school crime and the following elements: safety school programs; child
-
abuse reporting procedures; disaster
-
response 
procedures; su
spension and expulsion policies pursuant to Education Code Sections 48900, 48915, and 49079; the 
District's Discipline Handbook and Sexual Harassment Policy; our school dress code; and procedures and rules for safety 
on the way to and from school, as well 
as during school hours.  The plan is updated every year and approved by our School 
Site Council in February.  Our site has emergency water, blankets, first
-
aid supplies, radios, flashlights, and tools 
recommended for disaster use.  The plan was discussed w
ith staff at the beginning of the school year in August 2019 and 
will be reviewed and updated once again in March of 2020.
 
 
Ongoing dialogue with staff continues as we focus on a safe and clean school environment.  Disaster drills were 
implemented and teac
her feedback was reported to administrator and safety coordinator.  The feedback was taken into 
consideration to make changes as we continue to refine our safety plan.  Each teacher is provided a copy of the safety 
plan annually and it is reviewed so all s
taff understands their role during an emergency situation.  An annual inventory of 
supplies is also held to replace/replenish essential materials to ensure safety.  In addition to this plan, Troth Street has 
implemented Positive Behavioral Interventions an
d Supports (PBIS) program.  Among its many functions, this program 
works to promote a positive, safe and productive school environment that ensures quality learning and enrichment for all 
students.

Student data analyzed through district benchmarks and SBAC reporting revealed student needs in English Language Arts 
and Math.  Primary intervention in grades K
-
3 has been a focus through district professional development and ongoing 
collaboration and mode
ling of lessons at the school site.  This addresses teachers' particular needs to continue to develop 
primary reading instruction.  In addition, progress monitoring of instructional focus has also been a target to formally 
measure growth of students.  This
 
school year we have also used staff meetings as continued professional development 
sessions.  Our AVID trained teachers have facilitated various AVID strategies and continued dialogue of best practices.  
Staff meetings have also included the discussion of
 
EL data.  We have implemented student goal sheets with two years 
SBAC data.  Teachers sat one
-
on
-
one with students and reviewed individual data regarding SBAC.  These goal setting 
conferences were also shared with parents.  Our staff meetings are held in 
different classrooms as part of the continued 
professional development model.
 
 
District
-
sponsored professional development has included math fun training.  Fish bowl strategies have been utilized to 
ensure teachers continue to grow professionally.  Continu
ous support and feedback has taken place by walk throughs of 
math fun strategies and practices.  The math coach has also modeled poster method at staff meetings and for individual 
teachers.  Technology professional development has also been on
-
going.  We h
ave discussed technology apps and how to 
incorporate technology in the classroom.  Our technology coordinator models lessons for teachers and assists with 
technology in the classroom.
 
 
The implementation of NGSS has been on
-
going through staff meetings, mi
nimum day collaboration, and district support.  
This year we have also offered enrichment classes for GATE students.  Since we are a large staff, we have continued to 
provide and support AVID conference training during the school year.  As we continue to a
nalyze data, we refine our 
professional development needs.
 
 
Our ongoing focus has also been the instruction of English Learners.  Fifty
-
five percent of our students are English Learners, 
therefore, discussing data to guide instruction has been present thro
ughout the year.  Data analysis includes being familiar 
with ELPAC and how CDE reports ELPAC data.  In addition, BELIEF training has been held during professional development 
time on minimum days.  The addition of English Learner newcomer classes has also 
been added as an intervention. In 
addition, this school year we have started Impact Teams as a formative process to guide classroom instruction.
