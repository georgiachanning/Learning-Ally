By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

environment in order to reach their highest potential.
 
 
Pauba Valley Elementary School Curriculum Goals:
 

 
Students will participate in activities which facilitate growth in civic and social responsibilities and foster 
appreciation for democratic 
ideals and our societal values.
 

 
A relevant and rigorous core curriculum, appropriate to the grade level of the learner, will promote essential 
knowledge acquisition.
 

 
Students of all ability levels will have access to the core curriculum. Instruction will b
e highly integrated providing 
examples of "connectedness" between disciplines.
 

 
A broad curriculum will provide experiences which will have a positive impact on the students' ability to use 
leisure time well; exposure to fine arts, physical education, and t
he practical arts will provide the basis for 
leisure pursuits.
 

 
All students will have access to core curriculum activities to foster, promote, and maintain proficiency in reading 
and math.
 

 
Students will be given numerous opportunities to develop their crit
ical thinking skills to be used as a tool for 
problem solving and heightened comprehension.
 

 
A high regard for wellness will be reflected in a curriculum which values physical and mental health.
 

 
Activities which enhance self
-
esteem and build positive regard
 
for others will be offered. Effective strategies for 
conflict resolution will be explored at all grade levels.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Pauba Valley Elementary School has 34 permanent class rooms and 10 portables. Our facilities include a library media 
center, and a multi
-
purpose room. Pauba Valley Elementary School also has an outstanding garden. Weekly c
lasses are 
held in the garden where students discover the various workings of nature along with digging into class garden plots. 
TVUSD's Maintenance and Operations division works diligently to ensure our facilities are clean and safe for students, 
teachers
 
and staff. The district follows a comprehensive preventive and deferred maintenance program to offset costly 
repairs and minimize disruptions to the instructional program. Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices 
and bathrooms are clean an
d well maintained.  Our school has one full time lead custodian during school hours, and a 
night crew that comes in and cleans the entire facility after school hours. In addition, between two and three times a year 
the carpets at each site are steam cleane
d.

includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for E
nglish language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linke

or the PTA President. Volunteer opportunities occur year round and include before and after school help as well as during 
the day in and out of the classroo
m. Volunteers are used for academic assistance, preparing materials for students and 
teachers and organizing our numerous PTA events. Pauba Valley also offers a volunteer program that encourages males

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School safety is a high priority for our school and district. Our school has a comprehensive School Safety Plan. The plan 
covers topics such as disaster response, safe ingress and egress and 
ensuring a safe and orderly environment. Additionally, 
the plan includes data on suspensions and expulsions as well as school and district crime data.
 
 
Our school is a closed campus that is fully enclosed by fencing. During the school day, visitors and vol
unteers are required 
to sign in at the front office prior to entering campus. In instances of an emergency, we use an automated telephone 
system to contact parents with pertinent information.
 
 
To better prepare our teachers, students and staff for emergenc
ies, our schools conducts fire, earthquake, and lock down 
drills regularly throughout the school year. Education Code mandates that all elementary and middle schools hold a fire 
drill each month they are in session as well as an earthquake drill at least f
our times during the school year.  In addition, 
we hold three lockdown drills each year.  In February and May of 2018, the students and staff participated in a full scale 
emergency drill, including search and rescue, first aid, sanitation set up and studen
t release.  Our full scale emergency drill 
for this year will January 2020.

District Commitment to Learning for All Students
 
 
The Temecula Valley Unified School District is committed to ensuring that each and every child in its care receives a 
rigorous, 
multifaceted educational experience preparing them for the demands of college and career.
 
 
TVUSD teachers engage in active staff development throughout the year by attending:
 
 
In
-
District training sessions provided by staff and consultants.
 
 
Site
-
based tra
ining sessions presented during staff meetings and committee/grade level meetings.
 
 
One on one training provided during formal observations and post observation conferences.
 
 
Staff members are sent to national and state conferences to fine
-
tune instruction
al practices in specific areas.
 
 
Teachers with specialized training are given opportunities to train their peers, and provide instructional support as teacher
 
leaders.
 
 
Standards Based Instruction
 
 
Staff development focuses on implementing the New State Standards and state frameworks in English
-
Language Arts, 
Science, social science, and Math, K
-
12. Routine district sessions bring teacher leaders and principals together to devise 
and refine the curri
culum and assessments. Teams began by identifying priority and supporting standards, grouping the 
standards into units of instruction, and crafting common interim and summative assessments, developing scoring rubrics, 
and discussing sound grading practices
 
for each course/grade. Leaders return to sites to facilitate their grade level/course 
teams in reviewing the work, suggesting resources, and providing feedback for the refinement committees.
 
 
Collaborative Teams
 
 
Teachers are divided into Professional Lea
rning Communities (PLCs) based on content area and grade level. All 
instructional staff participate almost weekly during professional growth time meeting in their PLC groups to align 
curriculum, refine teaching strategies, create assessments, analyze stude
nt achievement data and transition to New State 
Standards.
