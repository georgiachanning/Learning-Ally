School Description
 
Nestled in the East Bay hills of the San Francisco Bay Area, Vallejo Mill Elementary School takes 
pride in developing academic excellence and building community.  Vallejo Mill i
s tucked into a 
diverse neighborhood at the base of a large hillside where cattle still graze.  Although it is currently 
a transitional kindergarten (TK) through sixth grade school, throughout its history it has served 
students from preschool through junio
r high.  Like the community around it, Vallejo Mill Elementary 
changes and adapts to reflect the community it serves.
 
 
Vallejo Mill Elementary is proud of its academic excellence and high expectations for all students.  
We were selected as a 2015 
Honor Roll School by Educational Results Partnership (ERP) and the 
campaign for Business and Education Excellence.  For over 40 years, Vallejo Mill has served as a 
Spanish bilingual and dual immersion school.  We have refined our instructional practices an
d 
bilingual model to best meet the needs of our students.  Our students and students from across 
Fremont and beyond choose to participate in our Spanish Dual Immersion Program (SDI) in 
kindergarten through sixth grade.   Our goal is to prepare a diverse st
udent population participating 
in the program to become bilingual and bi
-
literate.   Our school
-
wide technological upgrades have 
allowed students to access the latest research
-
based software and on
-
line programs that support 
21st Century learning.   Additi
onally, students have the opportunity to participate in enriching 
before and after school activities, such as Safety Patrol, Band, Sports, Young Rembrandts Drawing 
Class,  Mad Science, and Chess Club, all of which promote positive social interactions and s
uccessful 
student outcomes.
 
 
Our entire staff sees its own continuing education and professional growth as key to educating our 
students well.  In particular, we value professional development that fosters community, refines 
practice, and most importantly,
 
increases student learning,  Our staff continues to participate in 
Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) or grade
-
level teams.  Our teams collaborate on a regular 
basis, analyze data, and share research
-
based educational practices to improve outcomes f
or all 
students.  The majority of our teachers are also trained in Guided Language Acquisition Design 
(GLAD). GLAD is a model of professional development in the area of language acquisition and 
literacy.  The strategies and model promote English language a

Vallejo Mill is a Restorative Practices School.  Training has been provided by the International Institute of Restorative Pra
ctices (IIRP) in 
support of creating and 
complementing existing school climate strategies and approaches that lead to an inclusive, equitable, and safe 
school environment for our school community.  It has helped us transform our school into a caring, respectful learning enviro
nment where 
students
 
and the broader community learn and grow.  Along with Eight Great Traits (monthly character traits), Cultural Competence 
lessons, and anti
-
bullying initiatives, our staff instills the values of character education through an ongoing process that is based 
upon 
clear agreements for behavior, social skills, acceptance of diversity, and reflection.  We envision a school community of res
pectful, 
responsible, and resilient life
-
long learners working towards their full potential. Our mission is to engage students
 
in high levels of learning 
and empower them to be active learners in a safe, inclusive environment.  We will encourage community members to take risks, 
think 
critically, work collaboratively, and find joy in learning.
 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condit
ion and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annua
l school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the Calif
ornia 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether 
schools have enough books in core classes for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State 
Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Vallejo Mill School was built in 1955.  The interiors of the buildings need to be painted.  We also have five portables that 
are in good condition.  We have 
one day custodian and 1.5 night custodians w
ho keep our facilities clean.  Each classroom and the restrooms are cleaned every day.  Our day custodian 
picks up litter daily.  District maintenance staff remove graffiti, make repairs as needed, and maintain landscaping on a mon
thly schedule.
 
 
In 2008

2
009, an additional staff restroom was built at the end of the third wing.  A new surface of asphalt was added to the intermed
iate/upper 
playground.  New drainage and an asphalt surface were added to the areas between the buildings.  An enlarged field, in t
he primary playground, opened 
for student use in March 2010.
 
 
During the summer of 2011, additional surface of asphalt was added to the playground and a wall ball court was built.  During
 
the 2012
-
2013 school year, 
a new playground structure was installed 
on the intermediate/upper playground. Vallejo Mill's PTA  funded the project.  With the passage of  Measure E 
Bond, the technology infrastructure was upgraded and completed in September, 2015.   In October, 2017, PTA raised over $30,00
0 from the Color Run 
towards a new and much
-
needed primary playground structure.  The new colorful primary play structure was installed in April, 2018 and provides for a
 
more safe and fun area for students to play.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district se
nt experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the Facilities 

 
questions you see on the 
School 
Facility Good Repair Status report.  Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date 
of the report.  Since that 
time, those conditions may have changed.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
There are many opportunities for parent and community involvement at the school.  Each school year, parents are invited to ta
ke positions on various 
school committees such as the Safety 
Committee, Safety Patrol, School Site Council (SSC), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), Spanish Dual 
Immersion Parent Group (Fremont SIP), and the Parent Teacher Association (PTA).  In addition to serving on committees and sch
ool events, parents a
nd 
community members are encouraged to be actively involved in all aspects of school life.
 
 
Parent  volunteers work in the classrooms directly with students and teachers to support academic growth and development, ass
ist with technology, and 
help office st
aff and the library technician.  Community members assist staff with monitoring our before and after school Student Safety Pa
trol and 
supervising students during their lunch time.   Parent/family engagement sessions are offered throughout the year as well,
 
such as Parent Cafes, 
community presentations, and a maker
-
space/coding event.
 
 
Vallejo Mill (VM) has a dedicated, generous parent group that coordinates community events and raises funds for classroom sup
plies, field trips, and 
major improvements to our 
facilities. The PTA and VM Community raised money to purchase and install a new, much
-
needed primary playground 
structure in the 2017
-
2018 school year.  Other major fundraising efforts, in most recent years, include providing chrome books for student use, 
backpack 
hooks outside of every classroom, and a digital marquee for enhanced school
-
wide communication.  Additionally, our PTA sponsors extra curricular 
activities, such as Family Fun Nights/ Movie/Bingo Nights, Multi
-
Cultural Night, and the school Talent
 
Show.  All their efforts in supporting our students 
and school are greatly appreciated!!
 
 
To find out how you can volunteer at our school, please look online at our school website or contact the school office.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Staff monitors the 
school grounds for 15 minutes before and after school, as well as at all recesses.  Parent or community volunteers serve as c
rossing 
guards at crosswalks in front of the school.  We have five to six noon supervisors who supervise students during their lunc
htime.  Visitors must sign in at 
the office and wear a visitor's or volunteer sticker throughout their stay.
 
 
We revise our School Safety Plan annually.  The last update was adopted in May, 2019.  The plan includes procedures for emerg
encies, exit routes, 
and 
inventories of emergency supplies.  We share the plan annually with the staff.   Copies are kept in the school office for par
ents and community members 
to view.  We practice monthly fire drills, and alternate emergency disaster drills, such as earthqua
ke and lock down procedures.  We hold training for 
staff on emergency procedures as needed.  Most teachers who have students with allergic reactions voluntarily take the traini
ng necessary to administer 
certain medications on study trips or emergencies.   
In August, 2018, our staff participated in Run, Fight, Hide (Dangerous Intruder) Training.  Two
-
Thirds 
of our staff voluntarily got CPR trained in September, 2018, which is good for two years.  Most teachers who have students wi
th allergies voluntarily 
par
ticipate in Epipen training on an annual basis.  The majority of our staff keep their certifications current.

Professional Development provid
ed for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. 
 
Below is the amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional
 
development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
2017
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations these days are sometimes reduced.
