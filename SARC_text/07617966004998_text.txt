By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Tara Hills: Committed to doing Whatever It Takes to ensure the success of every student. T
ara Hills Elementary School 
provides a rigorous, engaging academic program, using the state
-
required curriculum, research
-
based teaching strategies, 
and implementation of the California Common Core Standards. Our teaching staff and support personnel work t
ogether 
to create a calm, safe, and supportive environment. Tara Hills strives to serve all of the students' academic, social and 
emotional needs.
 
 
Tara Hills is aligned with our shared district focus of increasing student and teacher discourse, using mult
iple methods to 
solve math problems, using frequent and authentic formative assessments, teaching academic vocabulary, daily 
informational reading and writing, citing text evidence, and providing daily ELD. Our staff has numerous opportunities to 
participa
te in a variety of workshops that include the district focus on a monthly basis.
 
 
Tara Hills has implemented the Response to Intervention ISP model, whereby we support all students based on multiple 
measures of data. ISP provides intervention support and e
nrichment instruction within the classroom and in the learning 
center. Staff members collaborate at and across grade levels weekly, teachers observe instruction in other teachers 
classrooms, and they meet three times a year for academic conferences to anal
yze student data and plan instruction to 
ensure the academic success of every student. Staff meets with the after
-
school personnel and with parents to make sure 
that all students are successful and prepared for the next grade, and to be college and career 
ready.
 
Tara Hills is committed to teaching Reader's and Writer's Workshop. Students read and write independently in multiple 
genres for purpose.
 
 
In addition to academics, our students enjoy participating daily in organized activities facilitated by a Play
 
Works Coach. 
After
-
school students can participate in drama, and student leadership. Our students enjoy having the Lawrence Hall of 
Science on campus and conducting experiments, participating in movie nights, and family art nights. Tara Hills also serves 
120 students in the YMCA after
-
school program.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school us
es 
the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California
 
OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest prio
rity. The school personnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment
 
of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and ma
thematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CC
SS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or ca
reer technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priori
ty: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Tara Hills provides a number 
of opportunities for parents to be involved in the school environment and involved in their 
child's academic success.
 
PARENT INVOLVEMENT PROGRAMS: We have a newly formed PTA, and a garden club. We will also be working with the 
West Contra Costa PTA on a se
ries of educational classes for our parents. This year we will have our third round of Parent 
University Graduates.
 
 
PARENT VOLUNTEERS: Tara Hills' parents support teachers in their classrooms, in the cafeteria, on the yard, on study trips, 
and for special
 
events. We put on two drama productions per year that many parents participate in helping our students. 
Parents can come to our Tara Hills office, sign in, receive a visitor's badge and volunteer in the areas they desire or where
 
there is need. Parents ma
y also volunteer in the library, the office, the learning center, and the after school program. To 
become a volunteer at Tara Hills or within the district, please go to www.beamentor.com to begin the process of 
supporting the schools of WCCUSD.
 
 
ENGLISH LE
ARNER ADVISORY COMMITTEE (ELAC): The ELAC Committee meets regularly to support the English learner 
population. ELAC represents students as second language learners in all aspects of their educational process. Discussions 
include matters of finance, social 
and academic progress, reclassification of second language learners and materials and 
supplies to support English Learners and students' overall progress.
 
 
SCHOOL SITE COUNCIL (SSC): The role of the SSC is to give parents, faculty and staff more on
-
site de
cision
-
making ability 
by giving individuals the opportunity to work together in planning school program improvements. SSC is responsible for 
approving and monitoring the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA). Every elementary school must have a School
 
Site Council composed of five voting parents or community members, the principal, three classroom teachers, and one 
other staff member (Education Code Section 52852). The Tara Hills School site council meets regularly. SSC meetings are 
open to the public.
 
 
Monthly, our parents meet with the principal for coffee and discuss upcoming events and student and school progress.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of the School Site Safety Plan is to provide a unified 
template for school sites to respond and recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the disruption of normal school operations.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan guides a coordinated school staff response to an emergency, disaster, or event and 
aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over time and those that may occur without warning.
 
 
The objectives of the S
chool Site Safety Plan are as follows:
 
1.
 
Protect the safety and welfare of students, school staff, and visitors.
 
2.
 
Provide for a safe and coordinated response to emergencies.
 
3.
 

 
4.
 
Enable the District to restore 
normal conditions with minimal confusion in the shortest time possible.
 
5.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between sites and the District Emergency Operations Center (DEOC).
 
6.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between the District EOC and th
e Cities of Richmond, El Cerrito, San 
Pablo, Pinole, Hercules, and Contra Costa County Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
 
7.
 
Provide for the orderly conversion of pre
-
designated District sites to mass care sites, when necessary.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safe
ty Plan is updated annually.  Our school safety plan was last annually reviewed, updated, 
and discussed with school faculty and a student representative in January 2020.  A copy of the Comprehensive School 
Safety plan will be available for review on the di

Tara Hills is implementing our shared district focus of increasing student and teacher discourse, using multiple methods 
to solve math problems, using frequent and authentic formative assessments, teaching
 
academic vocabulary, daily 
informational reading and writing and citing text evidence, and providing daily ELD and the posting EL instruction. Our 
staff is participating in a Teachers' College Workshop Model collaborative network that is providing trainin
g that includes 
our district focus. The staff has numerous opportunities to participate in a variety of workshops that include the district 
focus, and AR on a monthly basis. Quality instruction and instructional leadership are at the heart of the district'
s 
achievement efforts. To ensure this, the Academic Support Division engages teachers, administrators, and other personnel 
in ongoing professional development focused on improving teaching and learning. Training is provided to principals and 
other administ
rators to improve their ability to provide strong instructional leadership and guide teaching and learning at 
school sites. The principals, in turn, provide support to teachers through staff conferences, weekly collaborative study and 
planning, academic co
nferencing, peer observations, and individual coaching based on ongoing classroom observations. 
Teachers and other staff are provided with both on and off
-
site professional development in all CA Common Core 
Standards
-
based curriculum content areas. Beyond 
the content areas, professional development is provided in English 
Language Development, differentiated instruction, educational technology, and data analysis to meet the needs of all 
students. A primary goal of the professional development program is ensu
ring that all students are served by skilled, highly 
qualified teachers and that teachers are supported by strong, knowledgeable instructional leaders.
