School Description
 
We are the Roadrunners of Monterey Hills School (MHS). We serve the historical section of the Altos de 
Monterey in South Pasadena.  The school 
is attractively located and maintained, making it a favorite of MHS 
parents and community members to use on weekends and late afternoons. Our playground area is surrounded 
by tall pines and hills interspersed with grass lawns and blacktop playground sectio
ns. Protective fencing and 
gates at two strategic points in the front of our school were added during the summer of 2013.
 
 
MHS is one of three elementary schools, and a couple of years ago, MHS commemorated its 50th year as a 
school in South Pasadena Unifi
ed School District. We are proud to be a California Distinguished School, 
awarded to us in 2008, 2012 and just recently in 2018 by the California Department of Education. We were 
also a recipient of a Gold Ribbon Award in 2016.  Our most recent award was b
estowed upon us this year as a 
National Blue Ribbon School in 2019.   Our school is in the top 10 percent of all California elementary schools 
based on the annual state testing results. We use our California Standards to guide us in preparing our students 
to be college and career ready and are continually striving to build our instructional strategies to meet the 
needs of our student demographics and state and federal accountability mandates. Our school population this 
year is approximately 690 students.  W
e are the smallest of the three elementary schools, which has allowed 
us to support students through specialized programming from throughout the district, including a Special Day 
Class, Transitional Kindergarten classes, and the Spanish Dual Language Immer
sion Program.
 
 
Unique to our site is our special day class program that services all three SPUSD elementary schools for 
students in 3rd
-
5th grade. This program is supported by a psychologist, a speech therapist, occupational 
therapist, and adaptive physica
l education teacher.   Our Special Education Program is integrated with our 
regular education program and our SDC teacher, RSP teacher, and general education teachers work to provide 
effective mainstreaming opportunities and push
-
in and pull
-
out services i
n the least restrictive environment.
 
 
MHS also provides the instructional program for those students in the district who are eligible to participate 
in the Transitional Kindergarten (TK) program.  We have had the program at our school for the last seven 
years 
and worked to create the district TK report card.  The district provides an Extended Daycare program with 
before and after school daycare as well as a Kinder
-
care program that serves both our morning and afternoon 
kindergarten students.
 
 
We have impl
emented a Spanish Dual Language Immersion Program at our site and currently serve about 130 
students, K
-
4th grade.  Our goals are to develop bilingual, multi
-
cultural and academically proficient students. 
Teachers are working with the administration to com
plete a master
-
plan to ensure these goals are met. We 
have one dual immersion classroom from kindergarten to fourth grade and will continue to add a class a year 
until we have implemented a kindergarten through 5th
-
grade program.
 
 
The MHS PTA provides enri
chment experiences for all students by funding two field trip bus costs and any 
related admission charges. Some grade levels take additional outings to enhance the instructional program.  
Students take walking field trips in the community, take the local m
etro to attend plays, and visit museums.  
Our fourth
-
grade classes take a unique overnight field trip to Dana Point that includes reenacting crew 

 
MHS fifth graders take a week
-
long field trip at a science camp and experience an integrated instructional unit 
that covers earth, life, and physical science standards.  The PTA also provides funding for technology, cultural 
assemblies, and playground equ
ipment/improvements.   Fundraisers such as Wish Night, a jog
-
a
-
thon, box top 
collections, and several other events are scheduled annually to provide funds for an array of needs. Our parent 
volunteer base assists with school
-
wide special events (field trips
) as well as weekly time in the classroom.
 
 
The mission of the Monterey Hills Elementary School community is to assist all students in realizing their full 
academic potential and personal social development resulting in responsible, independent, and motiva
ted 
learners.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only el
igible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with

20)
 
Parents have many opportunities to participate at Monterey Hills School. Parents  are  active members 
of  our School Site Council and are recruited to 
serve.   Over 90% of our parents  attend  fall  and  spring  parent
-
teacher  conferences  as  well  as  the  Back
-
to
-
School  Night  and  Open  House. Parents  
contribute  their  talents  through  conducting 
science assemblies, visual and performing arts activities, art projects, and volunteering in the classrooms 
and on field trips, as chaperones.
 
 
The PTA is quite active.  Along with many programs they also raise funds for extra
-
curricular activities and typ
ically raise well over $100,000.  These funds 
support individual classrooms as well as grade level activities in five different areas:  cultural  arts,  academics,  physic
al  education,  technology  and  
community service. The South Pasadena Educational Fo
undation (SPEF) raised over $850,000 district
-
wide to support various programs.  Our PTA 
contributes to our school program both through volunteer time and financial contributions.

shared with and updated by the staff during a faculty meet
ing.  MHS has emergency fire drills on a monthly basis, lockdown and drop drills bi
-
annually, 
and annually participates in the Great California Shake

Four staff development days are scheduled into the school year to address both site and district level needs. These professio
nal development days are 

 
and Strategic Plan, goals which ensure academic achievement for all while closing the achievement 
gap for statistically significant sub
-
groups. Staff development is selected to address district strategic goals.
 
 
During the 2017
-
18 school year, the focus w
as on the ELA/ELD standards and the curriculum which was selected to deliver instruction: Benchmark 
Advance/Adelante curriculum.   The MHS staff, along with the other two elementary school staffs, participated in examining th
e curriculum and learning 
diffe
rentiated grouping techniques.
 
 
During the 2018
-
19 school year, our three days will be used in two ways.  Our first day included additional time to examine the Benchmark 
Avance/Adelante ELD and intervention curriculum and develop a curriculum map reflectiv
e of Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards.  
The second two days will be devoted to Covey Training on The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.  This training addresses co
mmunication and 
collaboration; independence and interdependence; and the i
mpact individuals have on an organization.  The training will provide a foundation and 
common language for our staff as we continue to work on creating a school climate of mindfulness.
 
 
During the 2019
-
20 school year, the focus has been on social
-
emotional
 
learning, technology integration, writing instructional strategies, and NGSS.
 
 
Additional staff development has been/is delivered at monthly faculty meetings, monthly professional development meetings; du
ring grade level release 
time and through attendanc
e at various conferences. All teachers at every grade level participated in Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI) training 
provided by the UCLA Math Institute. Recent topics that have been addressed include the evaluation of student writing, the ex
amination
 
of multiple 
measures, differentiated learning strategies, Thinking Maps, Project Lead the Way, Project
-
Based Learning (PBL),  and Common Core State Standards.
 
 
Teachers are supported through their Path I (feedback after formal observations) and Path II pl
ans (these plans plan address teaching standards agreed 
upon by teacher and principal).  Additionally, grade
-
level meetings, data analysis meetings, and peer planning meetings allow teachers to learn from 
their peers.
