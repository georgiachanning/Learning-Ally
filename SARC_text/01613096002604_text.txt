By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

We encourage you to be a part of the exciting learning activities at Grant School. Families can volunteer in many ways: 
assist in the classroom, join the Parent Teacher Association (PTA), atten
d School Site Council (SSC) and School Advisory 
Council (SAC) meetings, be a part of the English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), or lend a hand on special school wide 
projects. Please join other families in our Family Center which is open every morning,
 
except Tuesday, from 8:45 
-
 
10:30. 
Family involvement is not only welcomed, it is essential to the success of our school. We are also pleased to offer many 
workshops for our families on a variety of topics (Parenting skills, computer/employment skills, fi
tness and nutrition, 
literacy, learning about the common core state standards and more!)
 
 
We know our school is special and are so grateful to be a part of this wonderful learning community!
 
 
Sincerely, Joshua Jackson

The San Lorenzo Unified School District teachers and staff will collaborate with families and the community to cultivate 
safe learning environments and ensure equitable opportunities and o
utcomes for all students.

informed and socially responsible advocates 
for equity and social justice as a result of their education, experience and support from educators, familie
s and the 
community
 
 
Grant School Vision and Mission Statements
 
 
Equity
 
 
To become an actively anti
-
racist community we will:
 

 
Have a clear and focused lens that admits racism exists at Grant School and to bravely acknowledge that having 
conversations aroun
d race will be uncomfortable.
 

 
Understand how our behaviors and practices are linked to our expectations of student achievement.
 

 
Clearly define classroom, school
-
wide and community strategies that will accomplish the task of helping to heal 
the effects of r
acism.
 

 
Gain and improve skills and strategies to teach students of all races, cultures and language backgrounds by 
creating new tools, improving old tools and remaining flexible.
 

 
Use authentic data to identify achievement gaps.
 

 
Consider diversity and langu
age abilities when hiring new staff and develop the multilingual skills of existing 
staff.
 

 
Understand that our moments of discomfort are also our moments of greatest learning.
 
Math 
 
Our mission is to provide a high quality, challenging 
and accessible mathematics education to our students. 
 
 
We believe the following:
 

 
Learning mathematics is maximized when teachers focus on mathematical thinking and reasoning.
 

 
Learning mathematics is enhanced when content is placed in context and is connec
ted to other subject areas 
and when students are given multiple opportunities to apply mathematics in meaningful ways as part of the 
learning process.
 

 
Computational skills and number concepts are essential components of the mathematics curriculum.
 

 
It is ou
r responsibility to enable all students to formulate, analyze, and solve problems proficiently.
 

 
Students use diverse strategies and different algorithms to solve problems, and teachers must recognize and 
take advantage of these alternative approaches to he
lp students develop a better understanding of 
mathematics.
 

 
The assessment of mathematical understanding must be aligned with the content taught and must incorporate 
multiple sources of information, including standardized tests, quizzes, observations, perfo
rmance tasks using 
rubrics, and mathematical investigations.
 

 
Use of scaffolding for linguistic needs of students.
 

 
Students will be able to explain their thinking by writing about their work in math.

Literacy 
 
Our mission is to provide a high quality, ch
allenging and accessible literacy education to our students.Grant School has 
long embraced proven practices in literacy instruction and we continue to gain expertise as we adopt the Lucy Calkins et 
al's work in reading and writing workshops as it aligns wi
th the CCSS in English (Pathways to the Common Core). Grant 
School has a balanced literacy program that includes English Language development, differentiated instruction, flexible 
and need
-
based guided reading groups in reader's workshop model (minilesson,
 
independent work, conferencing, partner 
and whole group share, and strategies teaching) writer's workshop with a focus on specific and timely feedback given 
during conferences, word work and spelling, phonemic awareness, explicit teaching of comprehension
 
strategies, use of 
nonfiction and fiction text, book talks and instruction in how to write for multiple purposes and for multiple audiences. 
Our literacy program includes intervention for the struggling readers and writers and we have fully implemented th
e 
Reading Recovery program. We know that children who achieve proficiency in reading by third grade are far more 
successful in school and we are committed to early intervention and using best practices in literacy and ELD to close this 
achievement gap. We 
use Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark assessments and monitor our students' progress with 
assessment walls for reading scores and writing prompts which are scored collaboratively using common rubrics aligned 
to the CCSS. As well the TSAs monitor performance an
d progress with literacy profile reports tied to the grading periods. 
We love reading and writing at Grant School and we work hard to spread that joy to our students! We believe that literacy 
is the key that unlocks doors. It is accomplished with the high 
expectations and the understanding of how children learn 

 
 
English Language Development 
 
Our mission is to provide a high quality and accessible ELD education to our English learner students. We believe English 
learners acquire language with teachers using strategic instruction based on language proficiency levels. We know that EL 
students benefit from leveled questions around content based on language levels and we know that ELD is woven into all 
content areas a
nd throughout the day. We aim to immerse our EL students in rich literacy environments and expect 
students to practice oral language in all contexts. We strive to teach academic language and use scaffolds and strategies 
to link students with content. We kn
ow that children learn English by talking with partners, small groups (heterogeneously 
and homogeneously grouped), and in the whole group. We expect during ELD time that EL students will do at least half of 
the talking in the classroom, giving students amp
le time to discuss and deepen their learning and teachers time to listen 
in and assess to impact instruction. We embrace professional development and collaboration to help us grow in our 
understanding of ELD and how language is acquired. We look to learn m
ore about the ELD standards of the CCSS. Programs 
such as SEAL charge us to do the work to move our English Learners through the proficiency levels. And lastly we know 
that our workshop model in teaching reading and writing and our math instruction can be 
tailored to build language and 
include all ELstudents, regardless of proficiency level. We strive to give access to our English Learners to academic 
excellence and in doing so, continue to close the achievement gap for them.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents, guardians, and members 
of the community participate in various organizations that emphasize working 
collaboratively with staff members. Grant Elementary has an active PTA that supports the instructional program and 
provides extracurricular activities. The SSC and ELAC participat
es in establishing goals, identifying strategies for meeting 
goals, building a budget that supports the school plan, and monitoring it on an ongoing basis in accordance with the District
 
School Board policy.
 
 
Many parent involvement activities and celebrat
ions are held throughout the year. Volunteerism is valued. Parents are 
encouraged to volunteer and be involved in ways they would like to contribute. Informational events and written 
communications suggest ways for parents and guardians to support their ch

classroom communication from teachers, and weekly envelopes/folders keep families well informed of all activities. An 
inclusive community is built by sponsoring school wide events. These events include, but 
are not limited to: Parent 
Education Nights, Family Literacy and Math Nights, Open House, Science Nights, STEM Nights, SEAL gallery walks, cultural 
festivals, school

" 
mornings where families and staff share information and learn together.
 
 
In addition, we are thrilled to provide our Family Resource Center which opened its door December, 2010. The Center 
offers many resources and classes for families. We offer the Scho
ol Smarts Parent Academy where parents and family 
members learn about the school system, growth mindset, navigating school meetings, and how to support their student 
in school.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Grant School and its staff is committed to providing a safe, clean and 
academically rigorous environment. We believe that 
in order to learn students must first feel safe. In our classrooms, teachers are skilled at conducting class 
meetings/community circles as well as having high expectations for student behavior. Grant Schoo
l is implementing the 
practice of Restorative Justice as a way to serve children in developing two very important resources needed for academic 
success. First, students will develop the emotional resource of being able to choose and control emotional respo
nses and 
second, for students to have frequent access to adult relationships and role models who are appropriate, nurturing and 
supportive. To support these efforts, teachers and staff have been trained in the Toolbox Curriculum 
-
 
a social/emotional 
curric
ulum that empowers children in developing the tools they need to be successful both academically and 
socially/behaviorally. Such daily restorative practices correlate directly to a safe school environment.
 
 
There is an Emergency Operations command structur
e in place, and all staff have specific assignments in case of an 
emergency (such as first aid, search and rescue, emergency student dismissal, food/shelter, and safety). A flow chart of 
assigned duties and a description of duties has been distributed to a
ll staff. There is a freestanding metal storage shed 
housing  two 50
-
gallon drums of water, first aid supplies, and other emergency supplies. Furthermore, each teacher has 
an emergency backpack in his or her classroom with special emergency supplies.
 
 
Thro
ughout the year, the staff receives disaster preparedness training. In addition, there is regularly scheduled disaster, 
fire, shelter
-
in
-
place and intruder drills rehearsed each month. The knowledge gained from our training, research, and 
drills has been i
ncorporated into the School Safety Plan. This plan includes information about child abuse reporting, sexual 
harassment policy, dress code policy, the Grant School Code of Conduct, and the District wide Safety Plan, as well as 
disaster preparedness. The Sch
ool Safety Plan is available for review on the school's website.
 
 
The School Safety Plan was most recently reviewed, updated and discussed with school faculty in September of 2019.  
Electronic copies of the plan have been shared with all members of the sta
ff.  Several hard copies are available on campus 
for reference.

Professional Development for New 
Teachers:
 
Through participation in the East Bay Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) Induction Program, the District 
secures support providers to work with our new teachers. Through this BTSA Induction Program, new teachers are also 
afforded the opportuni
ty to take university level courses at a reduced tuition cost. This program offers training to new 
teachers for two years, as they sharpen their skills as educators. The induction portion of this program leads them to 
acquiring their clear credential throu
gh the Commission on Teacher Credentialing. Grant currently has one teacher 
accessing this program.
