By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or
 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
pr
incipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

For English
-
Language Arts, the teacher and scholars use Houghton Mifflin 
Common Core materials to supplement their 
instruction. However, a Reading Workshop approach based on Daily 5 and CAFE is used with an emphasis on classroom 
libraries and self
-
selected reading materials. For Grades TK
-
1, Zoophonics is used to teach decoding
 
to beginning readers. 
Learning A
-
Z and iReady Reading are also used as resources for all grade levels.
 
 
For mathematics, Go Math! is used. However, teachers supplement this program heavily to meet the needs of all scholars. 
Also, iReady Mathematics is als
o used at all grade levels. For science, FOSS Kits are used with its strong correlation with 
the Next Generation Science Standards. They also use resources such as Little Bits, VEX Robotics, and zSpace to enrich 
their scholars' experiences in science. For 
social studies, historical fiction literature, research, as well as field trips, enrich 
the scholars' experiences.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
When opening as a new school in 2015
-
2016, GOALS Academy obtained a Certificate of Occupancy issued by the Orange 
County Public Works. The school conducts monthly emergency drills, 
alternating among earthquake, fire, and intruder on 
campus scenarios. The most recent Safe School Plan was approved on June 3, 2019, by the School Site Council, as well as 
the GOALS Academy Governance Committee. It will be revisited in January 2019. During
 
the 2017
-
2018 school year in 
partnership with the Anaheim Police Department, there was a refinement in how the school plans to respond to an 
intruder on campus, and these modifications have been included in each updated Safe School Plan. Some details incl
ude 
the following:
 

 
Staff members will provide support for arrival and dismissal of scholars at the north (pedestrian) and south 
(vehicle) sides of the school
 

 
Gates will be locked during the instructional day, with pedestrian access on the north side 
controlled by a 
combination lock
 

 
Staff, parents, and volunteers will be given badges for ease of identification
 

 
Teachers, instructional assistants, and the director will be equipped with communication devices when outside 
of their classrooms with their sch
olars (e.g., walkie
-
talkies and/or cell phones using Slack)
 

 
Through the support of instructional assistants, the adult:scholar ratio during breakfast, recess, and lunch will 
be no more than 1:30
 

 
All GOALS Academy staff will be first aid and CPR trained and
 
certified
 

 
Illuminate (the school's Student Information System or SIS) is used to track various forms of data associated with 
physical safety
 

 
The building and grounds will be kept clean, well maintained, and safe through the efforts of staff and the 
purcha
se of supplies
 

 
The building will be supported by the necessary utilities
 

 
The school will be covered by the appropriate insurance
 
The complete Safe School Plan can be accessed on the school's webpage at http://goalsacademy.us/.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018

During the instructional day, each classroom has the support of a credentialed teacher, as well as a highly 
qualified 
instructional assistant. There is also a Teacher on Special Assignment (TOSA) for Tier 3 support, as well as an education 
specialist to provide academic support to scholars under IEPs. Volunteers and fieldwork college students are also 
welcomed t
o further decrease the adult:scholar ratio. This staffing and infusion of volunteers permit greater 
differentiation, individualization, and personalization of instruction for each scholar. Additionally, teachers offer tutorin
g 
after
-
school on an as
-
needed 
basis to provide both individual and small group support.
 
During the 2016
-
2017 school year, GOALS Academy became a member of the El Dorado SELPA, which specializes in 
meeting the needs of public charter schools and their Special Education scholars. Becaus
e of the small size of our school, 
the Special Education staffing configuration is composed of both part
-
time and full
-
time educators. There is a full
-
time 
assistant director who specializes in Special Education, as well as a full
-
time education specialist
. There is a part
-
time 
speech/language therapist and occupational therapist. Other needed services are contracted through Specialized Therapy 
Services (e.g., nurse, psychologist, etc.) and Western Youth Services (e.g., counselor).

After school, most of GO
ALS Academy scholars are involved in one of three after
-
school programs. The Little Labs Program 
for Grades TK through 2 is a fee
-
based, after
-
school enrichment program that focuses on enrichment in the arts and 
science, homework support, and physical fitn
ess. Fees are waived if families opt to volunteer instead or if there are special 
circumstances. The Big Labs Program for Grades 3
-
6 offers a vast array of electives for scholars to choose from in an 
elective format with three 50
-
minute sessions per day. T
he electives are taught by experts in their fields, and scholars may 
sign up for new electives each trimester. The GOALS for GOALS Academy (GFGA) Program is funded through an ASES 
Grant. In addition to homework support and athletics, including ice hockey, 
scholars build a sense of team spirit and 
community involvement. All three programs run from 3:00 to 6:00 p.m., with GFGA requiring a commitment of three hours 
per day, five days per week.
 
GOALS Academy also offers a full
-
service breakfast and lunch progr
am, with the majority of the scholars qualifying for the 
free/reduced meal program. After
-
school snacks are provided to all scholars participating in after
-
school programming.

increased to tend days of professional development for the 2019
-
2020 school 
year. These professional development days 
occurred prior to the start of the school year in order to avoid nonscholar days during the school year. The teachers 
received a stipend for attending the ten extra day. Primary areas of focus for the three most re
cent school years include:
 

 
The Daily 5 in Reading
 

 
CAFÉ in Reading
 

 
Zoophonics

METHODS
 
 
In addition to the pre
-
service professional development each summer, GOALS Academy teachers participate in ongoing 
training in the school


collaboration time (i.e., Think Tank Me
etings), teachers develop and analyze curriculum across the grade levels, discuss 

review professional literature and research regardi
ng curriculum and pedagogy. Teachers are also provided substitute 
teacher coverage (i.e., guest teachers) so they can be involved in professional development offerings outside of the school. 
Examples include Kindergarten Workshops, Zoophonics Trainings, Re
ading Workshop Sessions, Special Education Sessions, 
ELPAC Administration, CAASPP Administration, etc.
 
 
SUPPORT DURING IMPLEMENTATION
 
 
In 2019
-
2020, four of the eight GOALS Academy classroom teachers have Clear Credentials. The four newer teachers have 
Preliminary Credentials and are participating in the Teacher Induction Program provided by the Orange County 
Department of Education (Year 1). Two GOALS Academy teachers, the assistant director, and the director serve as Teacher 
Induction Support Providers
.
 
 
The assistant director, who also coordinates the Special Education Program, observes, coaches, and evaluates the 
instructional assistants. With the support of the assistant director, the director observes, coaches, and evaluates the 
certificated staff. 
She conducts informal and unscheduled classroom observations at least once a week and provides 
feedback as needed. She also conducts formal observations two times a year, and she also completes mid
-
year and end
-
of year evaluations for each certificated sta
ff member.
