By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg

.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Established in 1950, Orange Grove Elementary School is located in the western portion of the Whittier City School District. 
Currently, the school's enroll
ment is approximately 380 students, with 96% of the population being Hispanic or Latino. 
Approximately 16% of our students are English Language Learners; 19% of our school population are students with 
disabilities. Orange Grove is a school
-
wide Title 1 sch
ool with approximately 77% of our pupils qualifying for free and 
reduced
-
 
priced lunch. All teachers and support staff at Orange Grove are highly qualified.  All students have access to 
standards aligned instructional materials and there is a process in pl
ace for teachers to order materials when needed.
 
 
Orange Grove School is a learning community of highly
-
qualified, dedicated staff, students, and parents who work in a 
team effort to increase student achievement. Our staff is currently working on increasin
g reading and math achievement 
throughout the school day. Teachers offer a Balanced Literacy environment where students provided instruction in English 
Language Arts (Reader's and Writer's Workshop,Word Work, and Shared Reading). Our school recognizes the 
importance 
of literacy.  This year's instructional focus is Reading, implementing the mini lesson and enhancing teacher time with 
students when they confer while students are reading independently.    Students who require additional support in 
Reading are 
grouped according to needs in the Response to Intervention (RtI) time.  Teachers are trained to provide 
support to all students in this area and meet every 6 weeks to discuss progress  with the goal of moving students according 
to their reading growth.  We
 
currently participate in Data Reflection Meetings where the Principal and Instructional Coach 
meet with teachers twice a month to monitor student progress by discussing assessment results and identifying what are 
the next steps for instruction for those w
ho are achieving and are not achieving grade level standards.   Eureka Math is 
implemented for Mathematics instruction daily in grades Kindergarten through fifth grade. STEM opportunities are 
provided to students throughout the school day.  Positive Behavi
or Intervention and Support is a focus on campus at 
Orange Grove.  Students are taught behavior skills to maintain a safe and health learning environment for all. Orange 
Grove serves as an effective and exciting place where all children can learn the acade
mic and social skills needed to be 
productive and successful scholars.
 
 
The mission of Orange Grove Elementary School is to cultivate a positive learning environment by collaboratively teaching 
a rigorous, enriched curriculum that educates and prepares all
 
students to become life
-
long learners who are critical 
thinkers, problem solvers and socially responsible citizens.
 
 

Science.  Our exp
ertly trained staff will utilize best practices in order to provide an innovative, differentiated, and enriched 
curriculum, which will incorporate state
-
of
-
the
-
art technology, the arts, and innovative STEM curriculum.  We will continue 
to foster an effecti
ve partnership among our staff, students and parents through collaboration, timely communication, 
and parent workshops so that all students will become life
-
long learners, critical thinkers, and socially responsible citizens.

materials aligned with the State Standards. Currently, all teachers in grades K
-
8 have access to math curriculum that 
supports teaching the CA Common Core Ma
th Standards.  Elementary grades use Eureka Math curriculum, which includes 

CPM curriculum includes student textbooks, online textbooks 

Reading and Writing Units of Study to support reading and writing instruction for all teachers in grades K
-
8. The Reading 
and Writing Units of Study are aligned to the standrads and were designed to 
match the rigor of the new CA Reading and 
Writing Common Core Standards. The District also purchased classroom libraries for each grade level to support the 
diverse reading abilities in each classroom. Curriculum was purchased to ensure students acquire th
e foundational reading 
skills needed for early literacy skills. Phonics, Spelling, & Word Study System by Fountas & Pinnell was purchased for grades
 
K
-
3 to help students attend to, learn about, and efficiently use sounds, letters, and words. In addition, C
lassroom Shared 
Reading materials by Fountas & Pinnell were purchased for grades K
-
2 to help build a strong early reading foundation. A 
process is in place for schools to order materials at the beginning of each school year for all students. In addition, t
here is 
a process to order additional materials throughout the year to address the changing needs of a schools student population, 

cla
sses so appropriate materials can be ordered.  Our school complies with the Williams Law; every child has an 
appropriate textbook for all academic subjects requiring textbooks. Students are allowed to take textbooks home  to study 
after school when needed.
 
The school uses district and categorical funds to provide supplemental materials for classrooms 
including classroom library books, as well as materials for intervention and ELD. Finally, WCSD has an established a 
thorough process for examining new instruc
tional materials as they become available. With the full implementation of 
the California State Standards, the District will use the process to examine, explore, pilot and adopt new curriculum 
materials aligned with the CCSS, with input and feedback from t
eachers, administrators and parents. Based on the 

to ensure that the most appropriate materials are identified for our students.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Established in 1950, Orange Grove School is located in a residential setting. We have a beautiful Wonder of Reading library. 
 
The students enjoy an abundance of field space and blacktop areas during recesses and physical education activities.  
Orange Grove
 
also has a Reading Garden that is kept up by the Dad's Club.  This area allows the classroom to be held 
outside in a nice area with grass space for the students to read and collaborate with each other.
 
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning st
andards for all schools in the district. Orange Grove has an eight
-
 
hour 
day custodian and an 8
-
hour night custodian. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school. The school facilities 
are well maintained and are cleaned on a regular basis.
 
 
The safety of our students is our number one priority.  All visitors are required to report to the school office upon arrival
; 
staff members supervise students prior to school beginning, during reces
s and lunch times, and at dismissal times as well. 
The front of the school was redesigned to be in compliance with ADA laws access and fencing was installed to ensure a 
single point of entry.  A new roof was installed in the summer of 2014 and the building
s were painted in the Summer of 
2016. The Solar Array, which is provides energy to our school, was installed in Spring of 2017 and provides shade for our 
students on the playground.  In 2018, contractors have updated the Internet conduit and to replace the
 
speaker system 
to communicate with the school  and classrooms during the school day.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety Plan is updated and reviewed by both the certificated and classified staff on a yearly basis as well as 
when the need arises.  This year, the Safety Plan was reviewed with the staff at the August 12, 2019 opening meeting and 
submitted to 
the District Office by October 24, 2019.  The School Site Council, Teacher Leadership Team and Law 
Enforcement reviewed the plan and approved it.  If there are changes to new protocol during the school year, the Safety 
Plan is revised and the updated plan 
is submitted to the District Office.
 
 
At every staff meeting, the staff addresses any safety concerns.  There is also a Safety Needs log so employees can indicate 
safety concerns in a timely manner.
 
 
Our earthquake bin contains necessities such as blankets
, flashlights, water, and food items. An inventory of the bin is 
completed yearly.  In our earthquake bin, every classroom has a supply of earthquake kits for their students.  Every 
classroom has a "Lock Down" bucket that contains needed supplies and mater
ials in the event a lock down takes place 
and the students must remain in their classrooms for a period of time. Classrooms also have an Emergency Rolling 
Backpack with emergency kits in the event of an emergency.
 
 
Orange Grove School is committed to the s
afety and security of each student. To maintain these conditions which 
contribute to the best possible learning environment, the School Safety Plan includes the following elements:
 
 
1.
 
School Crime Assessment: Orange Grove School provides compiled school crime information each month for the 
California Safe School Assessment as mandated by the State of California. This information is analyzed at each 
school site to determine what steps ma
y be taken to reduce incidents of crime.
 
 
2.
 
Child Abuse Reporting: Teachers and other school employees are trained yearly to understand the process of 
reporting child abuse as mandated reporters.  They are required by law to report any cases of suspected chi
ld 
abuse or child neglect. Reports are investigated by the Department of Social Services to determine if any follow
-
up on the report is necessary.
 
 
3.
 
Disaster Procedures: In order to ensure the safety of students and school personnel, the school safety commi
ttee 
has created a comprehensive Disaster Preparedness Plan. Emergency drills are held once a month and evaluated 
for effectiveness.
 
 
4.
 
Suspension and Expulsion Policy/Procedures to Notify Teachers of Dangerous Pupils: Guidelines are indicated for 
suspension
s and expulsion and if a student is deemed dangerous because of behavior at school or behavior 
outside of school which has been dealt with by county juvenile authorities, the teacher(s) of the student will be 
promptly notified of the status of the student.
 
 
5.
 
Suicide Prevention, Intervention & Postvention Procedural Guidelines:  Guidelines are indicated to support 
students in need for the prevention of suicide.
 
 
6.
 
Sexual Harassment Policy: Orange Grove School strictly adheres to district policies, which prohibi
t sexual 
harassment or discrimination of any kind. The sexual harassment policy is distributed to each student at the 
beginning of the school year, and employees are advised of their duty to take prompt action if they become aware 
of any incidents of sexua
l harassment.
 
 
7.
 
Student Release Procedures: Orange Grove School strictly follows our student release procedures, which includes 
releasing students only to individuals identified on students' emergency release cards and verifying these 
individuals by photo I
D.
 
 
8.
 
Visitors and Volunteers:  All visitors and volunteers must report to the school office, sign in and sign out, and wear 
a pass for identification while on campus.

School Wide Dress Code: Orange Grove School believes that a clearly defined dress code co
ntributes to a positive 
learning environment. Students at Orange Grove School participate in common dress. The primary standards for 
student dress and grooming include that the student should be neat and clean at school, and the student should 
not wear clo
thing that compromises safety, modesty, or disrupts school activities.
 
 
10.
 
Safe and Orderly Environment: Orange Grove School believes a safe and orderly environment is necessary to 
ensure a positive learning experience for all students.  Orange Grove implemen
ts PBIS (Positive Behavior 
Interventions and Support), a school
-
wide positive behavior approach to maintain a safe, nurturing climate for all 
students. Students are awarded for demonstrating behavioral expectations in different settings at school.  
Teacher
s, aides, and the administrator consistently supervise and interact with students to reinforce good 
behavior and safety standards.
 
 
Finally, a strong partnership exists between our school and local law enforcement. Local law enforcement agencies provide 
on
going support to the school and coordinates with school and district personnel to ensure students safety in case of a 
campus or neighborhood threat.
