By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Plumas Avenue Elementary School was constructed a
nd opened for the 2004
-
05 school year, and the facility is in very 
good condition.  All Plumas Avenue Elementary staff work diligently to ensure that our campus is clean, safe, and 
functional.  A District
-
Wide Work Order process has been established to gua
rantee efficient response time/service and to 
make sure emergency repairs are given the highest priority by district maintenance staff. The custodial and maintenance 
staff also keep the campus clean, with the vegetation maintained, the grounds free of tras
h, and the site graffiti free. The 
principal works closely with the custodial staff to ensure that all school facilities are kept clean and free of safety hazar
ds. 
In November 2019, the principal and custodian conducted a  FIT (Facilities Inspection Tool) 
of the school campus. We are 
proud to report that our facilities received a "good" rating with an overall rating of 98.9%.
 
 
In July of 2014, the school was repainted resulting in clean, like
-
new, beautiful campus.
 
 
In 2014
-
15 the transitional kindergarten 
and kindergarten rooms (1 and 2) were both re
-
carpeted and tiled. Also, the 
office, adjacent bathrooms, health office, and counseling offices were re
-
carpeted and tiled, and the floor underneath was 
sealed to eliminate any moisture from below.

In 2015
-
16,
 
the cafeteria/gym floor was replaced and sealed underneath to eliminate any moisture from below, and the 
roof above the kitchen was repaired to prevent leaks from heavy rains.
 
 
In 2016
-
17, the computer lab was also be re
-
carpeted/re
-
tiled, and the floor w
as sealed to eliminate moisture.
 
 
Each year classrooms with aged/worn carpet and linoleum are identified to receive new floor covering.
 
 
During the summer of 2019, the final gates were installed, so now the school is sealed off from the front, back and sid
es, 
keeping it safe from vandalism when school is not in session.

includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education populati
on and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the re
quirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Plumas Avenue 
school staff considers parental involvement an essential component of our school community. Parents 
are encouraged to help shape our school site's instructional program and categorical budgets via the School Site Council 
(SSC) and the English Language Advi
sory Committee (ELAC).  The Plumas Avenue School SSC is an active group active 
consisting of five elected parents, three teachers, one classified staff member and the principal. A new Parent Booster 
Organization is being organized in 2019
-
20 to support the
 
students and staff in a variety of ways, including helping with 
Dr. Seuss Day, Family Movie Nights, seasonal celebrations/activities and other school
-
wide events.  In addition, the Plumas 
Safety/School Climate & Culture Committee works with families to ga
ther input on keeping all students and staff safe, as 
well as making the school a safe and welcoming place and hub of the community.  Parents are always encouraged to 
volunteer in their children's classrooms, to assist with special activities, to help at s
chool
-
wide events, and to attend special 
events/activities, such as Books and Breakfast, Parent Paint Nights, Open Computer Lab, weekly school
-
wide assemblies 
(focused on building a positive school culture and climate
-
including social
-
emotional learning) a
nd other events focused 
on family engagement (both educational and just for fun). Outside agencies, including the University of California 
Extension and Hmong Cultural Center provide classes and offer support to further help families support their children
. 
Communication to parents is provided in English and Hmong, and families are notified of meetings and events through a 
monthly newsletter, written invitations/flyers, personal phone calls, recorded phone calls, texts, emails, social media and 
on the marqu
ee in front of the school.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Thermalito Union Elementary School 
District (TUESD) has a district
-
wide Comprehensive School Safety Plan that is 
updated annually, Pursuant to Education Code 32280 

 
32289. Our vision is to empower all stakeholders in order to create 
a safe and challenging environment where all students and
 
staff can be safe, and can grow academically, socially, and 
emotionally. We will provide an environment which allows for the development of attitudes that promote healthful 
physical, social, academic, and mental habits. This will be accomplished by encour
aging pride in self achievement, respect 
and responsibility toward self and others, recognition of students and staff, and positive relationships with young people.

At the Plumas Avenue Site, the number one focus is on safety, and our school safety goal i
s: "To ensure all students feel 
safe at school." School
-
wide behavior expectations have been adopted and are posted throughout the campus focusing 
on the three ideals of being Safe, Respectful and Responsible. Students are encouraged to keep these expectat
ions in 
mind throughout the school day and are recognized for their positive behaviors with PRIDE tickets (which can earn them 
Pizza with the Principal) and ongoing accolades from staff. In additional monthly character traits are taught, posted, and 
encour
aged at assemblies and in class, and a special celebration is held at the end of each month honoring students who 
have exemplified the character trait.
 
 
A Safety/Culture/Climate Committee made up of classified and certificated staff meets multiple times a 
year to evaluate 
the school climate and and to work together to provide the safest experience possible for students and staff. All visitors 
to campus are required to check in at the office where they receive a bright, yellow sticker identifying they are ap
proved 
to be on campus.The student pick
-
up procedure has been modified requiring those picking up students to wait at the front 
of the school behind the locked gates, until the dismissal bell rings. Staff members are also posted at various places on 
campus
 
(front, back, and sides, including the hallways and playground) to further ensure student safety before and after 
school. Eight cameras have been installed to provide additional security, both during and outside of school hours. Iron 
fencing has also been
 
installed across the front and sides of the school, and most recently, during the 2019 summer, 
additional gates were installed to close off the classrooms from the playground area, addling additional security to the 
school for when it is not in session. M
uch positive feedback has been received from the school community showing 
appreciation for the additional safety measures.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
Plumas Avenue School and the Thermalito Elementary Union School District are committed to providing 
supplemental 
services to our English Learners and students falling below grade level in English language arts/literacy and math. We have 
several programs in place to support our students, in order for them to be successful (funded by Title I and LCFF):
 

 
SST

 
(Student Success Team) 
-
 
This team meets one day per month and on an as needed basis (before and after 
school) to review and discuss the best approaches to meet the needs of struggling students (academically and 
socially/emotionally/behaviorally). Throug
h this process, a team of teachers, specialists, the principal, and 
parents of the students of concern meet to review strategies and practices already implemented and to look at 
interventions, supports and new strategies to help students be the most succes
sful.
 

 
Based on performance data in reading/language arts and math, our Reading intervention teacher (along with 
classroom teachers) selects students for targeted intervention groups that meet daily for focused instruction. 
These groups are flexible and cha
nge periodically, according to assessment data and student needs. Small group 
instruction takes place throughout the school day.

Accelerated Reader Program (AR) 

This supplemental program is used to encourage independent reading at 
increasingly higher instructional levels, using quizzes to assess comprehensi
on and vocabulary development. 
Currently the web based version called Renaissance Place is used.
 

 
In addition to classroom teachers providing 'First Tap' of English Language Development (ELD) Instruction to EL 
students, an EL Intervention teacher offers an 
English language support class for those students performing at

Number of school days dedicated to St
aff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Over the past several years, Plumas Avenue Elementary School and the Thermalito District has provided opportunities for 
staff to participate in a variety of professional development activities focused on 
improving instruction for all students. 
These opportunities include instruction in Wonders English Language Arts/English Language Development (ELA/ELD) 
Curriculum, Expressions Math curriculum, Thinking Maps, Systematic Instruction in Phonics, Phonemic Awar
eness and 
Sight Words (SIPPS), Common Core
-
Aligned Instructional Strategies, Freckle, i
-
Ready, and Being a Writer, as well as training 
in trauma responsive systems of support to become more aware and more responsive to the role trauma plays in both 
the liv
es of students and staff.
 
 
For the years 2017
-
2018, 2018
-
2019 and 2019
-
2020, Thermalito Union Elementary School District has provided several 
days per year of staff development for all teachers. All grade levels have worked hard to develop common pacing gu
ides 
and assessments aimed at improving instructional practices to better support ALL students. Plumas Avenue has developed 
a guiding coalition of teachers to lead our development, as we move forward in implementing a professional learning 
community model.
 
As a site and district, we have worked closely with BCOE (Butte County Office of Education staff), 
Dennis King and Solution Tree to help navigate this process.
 
 
In 2018
-
2019, we continued to utilize established district grade
-
level planning days to contin
ue our work developing and 
implementing math and ELA common pacing and planning guides as well as common formative assessments. Our Plumas 
site has developed a plan for weekly Collaborative Teacher Time (CTT) for grade levels to collaborate, look at specif
ic data, 
and improve instructional practices. In 2019
-
20, grade level teams continue their weekly CTT time for 45 minutes each 
week and share data, look at common formative assessments, discuss and model best practices, and develop intervention 
plans to me
et the needs of all students (below, at and above grade level). All grade levels have committed to providing 
twice
-
weekly grade level math interventions based upon the data reviewed at the weekly CTT meetings. Our Guiding 
Coalition is starting to examine b
est practices in utilizing this collaboration time and is also pursuing continued training in 
Trauma Responsive Systems of Support.
 
 
In addition, a District Reading Specialist/Coach was hired in 2018
-
19 and provided valuable training to both classified 
(pa
raprofessionals) and certificated staff in the areas of dyslexia and dyslexia screening, guided reading techniques, SIPPS, 
and phonic/phonemic awareness instruction. The District Reading Specialist/Coach has provided valuable coaching 
support to our teache
rs and developed targeted instructional practices to improve student achievement. In 2019
-
20 many 
teachers have enthusiastically taken advantage of the additional support offered by the District Specialist.
 
 
The Thermalito Union Elementary School District 
(TUESD) calendar and schedule provide 36 minimum days (in addition to 
the weekly CTT time), in order to provide teachers time to collaborate for the purpose of analyzing student assessment 
data, designing intervention groups, and planning for future instru
ction. Opportunities for peer support are built into the 
grade level planning meetings, and opportunities for principal support are also available via instructional feedback and 
tailored professional development.
 
 
Lastly, a multitude of professional develo
pment opportunities are offered throughout the year by the Butte County Office 
of Education, the California Department of Education and many other outside organizations. Staff members are 
encouraged to explore the array of opportunities available and are s
upported and encouraged to take advantage of 
conferences, workshops, seminars, and collaboration opportunities that will support them in building their expertise.
