Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in 
which data were collected:
 
January 2020
 
 
All TK
-
12 students have current standards
-
based textbooks in math, science, history/social science, and English/language 
arts. With each curricular cycle established by the State of California, the Conejo Valley Uni
fied School District (CVUSD) 
Board of Education adopts textbooks within the timeline provided. Standards
-
aligned books for grades 9
-
12 are approved 
locally. Textbooks in grades K
-
8 are selected from lists of books and materials approved by the State Board 
of Education. 
Sufficient standards
-
based textbooks and instructional materials have been purchased for all students in English, math, 
history/social science, science, health and foreign language. In addition, annually, sites receive specific science 
supple
mentary funds to be used for consumable laboratory expenses and/or equipment.
 
 
The process of selecting textbooks and materials involves the formation of a committee charged with the responsibility of 
reviewing current state standards and frameworks, analy
zing student data, writing courses of study (as required) and 
selecting and maintaining current instructional materials. The goal of such district
-
wide committees comprised of teachers 
and administrators representing all targeted grade levels, is to achiev
e high academic standards for all of our TK
-
12 
students. Each major subject area, such as math, science, history/social science, foreign language and English/language 
arts, is reviewed and adopted under the guidance of the California Department of Educatio
n and State Board of Education. 
The committee submits its recommendations to the Board of Education for final approval. The recommendation to the 
Board includes the basic textbook materials as well as supplementary materials within the subject. On October 
1, 2019, 
the CVUSD Board of Education approved a resolution for the 2019
-
2020 school year declaring that the Conejo Valley 
Unified School District has provided each pupil with sufficient standards
-
based textbooks and instructional materials 
consistent with
 
the cycles and content of the curriculum frameworks.

Each fall, a team that consists of all or many of the following personnel, inspects each school in the Conejo Valley Unified 
School District:  Site Administrator, Director of Maintenance and Operatio
ns, Director of Planning and New Construction, 
and the Assistant Superintendent.  A facilities evaluation is completed documenting the condition of the school in a variety 
of areas including the cleanliness of restrooms, condition of roofs, paving and walk
ways, HVAC systems, landscape 
maintenance, etc.  Any observed condition that represents a threat to the health and safety of students and staff is 
annotated for immediate correction.  Notes include items that could improve the utility, appearance, sustaina
ble 

Major Projects List.  The projects included on the final Major Projects List are based upon a priority assessment of all 
identified Dis
trict schools' needs and the funds available to address those needs.  The Board of Education approves the 
final list in the spring, so the majority of the projects detailed are completed the following summer.  Funds available 
through participation in the S

annual Major Projects List each year.  The District revises and submits a Five
-
Year Deferred Maintenance Plan to the Office 
of Public School Construction and has had no r
equired contribution to the Deferred Maintenance Fund since the 2008

09 

ity 
continues through the current school year.  Deferred Ma
intenance Program projects will be prioritized and financed with 
carryover funds from previous budgets or as augmented by future funds.
 
 
The District provides 2 full

time custodians at Conejo Elementary and they follow District
-
defined cleaning standards a
nd 
schedules to ensure that the school provides our students and staff with clean, healthy, and attractive learning 
environments. Conejo Elementary was opened in 1958.  Sited on 12.5 acres of land, the school has 30 classrooms, a 
multipurpose room, a libra

and upgrading underground utilities, restrooms, doors, and improving accessibility under ADA. The current capacity at 
Conejo is 590 students. The District Site Inspe
ction Team assessed the school on 12/26/19.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
