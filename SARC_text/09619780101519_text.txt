By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Since opening on August 18, 2003, Pleasant Grove has established a reputation for academic excellence and is a source of 
community pride. Pleasant Grove is located thirty miles east of Sacramento, California in the beautif
ul foothills of El 
Dorado County and is currently enrolled with 487 sixth, seventh, and eighth grade students.
 
 
At Pleasant Grove, our primary goal is to help all of our students be successful. All programs and policies are established 
to accomplish this g
oal.  In order to support this, Pleasant Grove couples our certified school
-
wide AVID program and 
practices with Positive Behavior Incentives and Supports (PBIS).  To support students on a path of career and college 
readiness, AVID brings research
-
based st
rategies and curriculum to educational institutions in elementary, secondary, and 
higher education. As a result, policymakers and educators now consider AVID's mission to be an essential strategy for 
closing the achievement gap and for making college acces
s and success available to all students. By implementing school
-
wide AVID strategies, we provide all students with methodologies that develop their critical thinking, literacy, and math 
skills across all content areas. Our AVID program focuses on skills an
d behaviors that promote academic success and 
provide intensive support with tutorials and strong student/teacher relationships, while also supporting peer 
collaboration, and a rigorous education. Our PBIS program, helps to foster and develop student's soc
ial emotional skills 
and successes.  For example, students are recognized and rewarded for their positive choices, taught or re
-
taught social 
skills as needed, and provided with various types of behavior supports.  The school
-
wide AVID and PBIS programs wo
rk 
together to develop the whole child both academically and socially.
 
 
In order to support the transition into middle school sixth grade from elementary, we core our students together. Core 
scheduling allows sixth graders to have the same teacher for hist
ory and language arts, the same teacher for math and 
science, and an additional teacher for PE. This reduces the amount of transitions and teachers from six different teachers 
down to three to four depending on each sixth graders' schedule.
 
 
The school day
 
is broken up into seven 50 minute periods of Math, Science, English, History, Physical Education, an elective 
and a lunch period. Elective options include: Band, Choir, Computer Science, Spanish, Leadership, Speech/Drama, Health 
and Fitness, Project Lead 
the Way (PLTW) Design and Modeling, PLTW Medical Detectives, Game Design, Art Exploration, 
Math or Reading Intervention, Study Hall and Advancement via Individual Determination (AVID). The staff has high 
expectations for the quality of work from students. 
Each student can expect to be treated fairly, to work and socialize in 
a safe environment, to be challenged, and to be properly instructed and evaluated by highly qualified, caring teachers. 
Middle school students rely heavily upon social affiliation durin
g a period of rapid physical and socio
-
emotional 
development as they establish a sense of self, while still needing adult guidance and connection.  We believe that middle 
school students are highly malleable, so they need adults with whom they can connect 
and who lead them in a positive 
direction by tapping into their interests to motivate positive relationships and strong educational habits.
 
 
Students with special needs are provided specialized academic instruction through several support programs. The 
Res
ource Specialist Program provides help for students in the areas of mathematics, reading and language arts, history, 
science, and electives.  This support is provided through multiple pedagogical practices: direct instruction, collaboration 
with the classr
oom teacher, team teaching, and paraprofessional support integrated throughout the school day and 
disciplines.  Special Day Classes (SDC) also serve our students who meet certain special education criteria. The class size i
n 
our SDC program is small to all
ow for individual attention; however, students can be fully integrated into mainstream PE 
and some elective classes with their general education peers.

Additional support is provided by a full
-
time counselor, a nurse, a full
-
time 
psychologist, a district EL Coordinator,  and a 
county speech/language specialist (2 days/week). A Learning Support Team is in place to support students who may be 
struggling academically or socially.  Tutorial instruction is available during lunch periods
 
and intervention aide supports 
are integrated into the classroom setting to provide support for students within the general education classroom setting.
 
 
To support our English Learner students we meet with each student one
-
on
-
one, each 
trimester, to establish and reflect 
on goals and discuss needs, areas of improvement and growth. In addition, aide support is available within the general 
classroom setting, as our English Learner students are fully integrated into general education classe
s.
 
 
Communication with parents is a key component to student academic success. It is critical to provide a format where 
students, teachers, and parents can communicate to support the development of student
-
centered learning and student 
self
-
advocacy. Pleas
ant Grove uses an online grading program, Jupiter Grades, and a classroom informational system, 
Google Classroom, to provide a format for more effective communication between all stakeholders. Through these 
interactive and engaged practices, parents have a
ccess to up
-
to
-
date information on student grades and upcoming 
assignments to support their student's academic success. Additionally,  progress reports are available three times a year 
through the Aeries Portal mid
-
trimester and report card grades are avai
lable through the Aeries Portal at the end of each 
trimester.
 
 
Pleasant Grove promotes a positive learning environment where all students are held to high academic standards and are 
recognized for positive behavior and hard work. Positive behavior and achi
evement are recognized through honor roll, 
student recognition assemblies (Student of the Trimester), compliment calls and letters home to parents/guardians, PUMA 
Pride Awards, and presidential awards.  There are also opportunities for all students to part
icipate in the California Junior 

leadership and to help to maintain a positive school climate.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
School buildings and grounds at Pleasant Grove provide a clean, positive environment that is conducive to teaching, 
instruction, and learning.  Staff and student restrooms are clean and well maintained. Floors, walls, roofs, and plumbing 
are maintained on 
a regular schedule.  All efforts to ensure building safety, cleanliness, and adequacy have been 
successful.  Rescue School District custodial and maintenance personnel work hard to keep the campus clean, safe, and in 
good working order.
 
 
While our facility
 
is still fairly new and in good working order, a district deferred maintenance program is in place to repair 
or replace major areas of the campus, such as roofs, black top, carpet, stucco, and heating/air conditioning units when 
eventually needed.
 
 
The fa
cilities at Pleasant Grove Middle School are in very good condition.    Recently added garden area was completed, 
courtesy of an Eagle Scout Project and a grant.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achi
evement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entranc
e to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents and students believe that Pleasant Grove provides a positive learning environment and the students are 
challenged in all academic areas.  Positive behavior and achievement are recognized by positive teleph
one calls, e
-
mails, 


is reco
gnized through the Honor Roll.  Eighth grade students are eligible for Presidential Awards for Academic Excellence.  
A committee of parents, teachers, students and administrators reviewed other middle school discipline policies and 
created a parent/student
 
handbook for Pleasant Grove. Again this year, the committee will review the existing policy and 
may recommend additional revisions.
 
 
In addition to academic recognitions, students are recognized for positive behavior with our Puma Pride Awards. This is 
pa
rt of our Positive Behavior Intervention Supports program also known as PBIS.  Additionally, through PBIS, students with 
qualifying merit counts are recognized at various times throughout the year.  The PBIS program is in the initial phase of 
incorporating
 
Best Practice Rules lessons to establish positive, clear, and regularly communicated expectations for 
students.
 
 
Each year, Pleasant Grove's Safety Committee reviews policies, assesses needs, and explores ways to make our school a 
safer place and improve 
the physical and cultural climates.  The Pleasant Grove Safety Committee consists of ten members: 
Both classified and certificated staff.  The school Safety committee meets tri
-
annually throughout the school year and the 
plan was last reviewed and updated 
in November 2019.  Our school Safety Plan is also reviewed by our school's Site 
Council. Physical improvements, leading to a safer school environment, have been made to our parking lot, asphalt courts, 
and play fields and we have evaluated, revised, and im
proved policies related to campus supervision, anti
-
bullying 
programs, and positive recognition events.
 
 
Pleasant Grove has several programs to further promote a positive climate and help students feel more connected to the 
school and their community. A WE
B (Where Everybody Belongs) program is in place to assist all new students in a positive 
transition to our school. Pleasant Grove students function in a safe, positive environment. Pleasant Grove recognizes that 
positive behavior and appropriate activities
 
will stimulate a healthy, productive school climate.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
All Rescue schools receive equal allocations, per student, of LCFF Base Funding.  This funding helps support students by 
providing instructional materials, supplies and other needs.  Funding for support services, such as maintenance of buildings 
and ground
s, utilities, and student transportation, is budgeted for at the district level and provided to each school site 
based on the varying needs of the individual school.
 
 
In addition to the Base Funding described above, schools in the Rescue Union School Distr
ict receive Supplemental funding 
roughly proportional to the number of unduplicated pupils (English Learners, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged, and 
Foster/Homeless Youth) they serve.  Furthermore, school sites receive allocations from other state and federa
l categorical 
programs, including Title I and Title II.  The purpose of these categorical programs range from improving the quality of the 
total instructional program for all students to addressing the unique needs of special groups of students.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Thirty Eight Early Release Professional Development/Teacher Collaboration Wednesdays are scheduled throughout the 
school year.  During these meetings, teachers work to analyze assessment data and target key standards.  In addition, they 
plan, develop and i
mprove effective instructional strategies.  Staff development related to instructional practices, 
curriculum, technology, Common Core State Standards, and other educationally related matters are provided for all 
teachers.
 
 
Teachers receive professional dev
elopment and will work collaboratively on a regular, ongoing basis to target key 
standards, analyze formative assessment data and develop effective instructional practices.  Teachers and administrators 
regularly attend conferences and workshops to learn ab
out and implement the most effective instructional practices.
 
 
Additionally, we provide two days for parent conferences, one and a half days for report card preparation and 
collaboration, and IEP/504 transition and collaboration days between the middle sch
ool and high school.
