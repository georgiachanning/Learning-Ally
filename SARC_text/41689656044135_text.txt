School Description
 
Encinal Elementary School, located in Atherton, California is a public elementary school serving a 
diverse group of 
approximately 635 students from grades K to 5 composed of 12% ELL, 6% IFEP, 
and 3% RFEP students. Encinal offers a variety of services, supports, and learning experiences and 
has strong parent support through an active Parent Teacher Organization (PTO). Ju
st over 11% of 
our student population are English Language Learners speaking a myriad of world languages.  
Encinal Elementary received the California Distinguished School Award in 2017 for significant 
improvement in state assessments in mathematics for stu
dents with disabilities, low SES, and 
hispanic/latino students. A spotlight on Encinal School was featured in San Mateo County's 
"Achievement in Motion" report highlighting best practices for student achievement. Encinal 
School also received an Exemplary V
isual and Performing Arts Award for our work in art, theatre, 
dance, and music.
 
 
We know that Encinal is a powerful learning community with a proud history. We are also a school 
that is consistently reflecting and learning, setting our sights on new ways t
o best serve our 
students.  As we head into 2020, we are taking the opportunity to take stock of the best of who we 
are today and who we want to be in this next decade. We are currently revising our mission 
statement and we are developing a learner profile
 
that will highlight the critical skills we believe 
our students will need to thrive now and and in the next decade.  We aim to launch our new mission 
by January 2020.
 
 
The K
-
5 Spanish Immersion strand at Encinal is one of the most distinctive aspects of t
he school. 
Students enter the program in kindergarten and learn in Spanish every year through fifth grade. 
Continuing our efforts to embrace cultural diversity and expand our focus on global understanding, 
our K
-
5 World Language Spanish FLES program also i
ncludes three Cultural Arts week celebrations 
throughout the year.
 
 
Students from neighboring communities are welcomed into the school via the Tinsley Volunteer 
Transfer Program, part of the San Mateo County Office of Education.
 
 
Encinal is 
especially proud of is its full inclusion Learning Centers that provides services to students 
with significant physical and learning needs. Students, who are given instruction through our two 
fully staffed classrooms, receive support from a team of occupat
ional and speech therapists, one
-
on
-
one assistance, the school counselor, and school administration.
 
 
Encinal teaches social emotional learning (S.E.L) for all students through our robust S.E.L program. 
Each year Encinal focuses on three themes. This year 
we are highlighting inclusion, gratitude, 
perseverance through lessons in each classroom, assemblies and workshops, and messaging on 
ENTV. Themes are determined each year based on prior student climate survey data and through 
parent input from PTO, School 
Site Council and our annual parent survey. In addition to the year 
long themes, all students are taught how to resolve conflicts peacefully through tools such as the 
"Go to 5", "Talk
-
it
-
Out" and the Four Square Apology. We will continue deepening understan
ding 
and implementation of Restorative Practices through classroom community circles and on
-
site staff 
development. Monthly Awesome Me assemblies highlight students who are following the Encinal 
Way: using kind words, including others, and caring about how
 
others feel.

Now in 
it's third year, our makers space provides integrated learning activities and new technology that include sci
ence, technology, engineering, 
math and art learning experiences. This year we adding sewing machines and mobile carts.  We continue our annual ENgineering 
Week 
that also brings in many parent volunteers to assist.
 
 
At the core of all of our work is Encina
l's commitment to close our achievement gap and to continue our equity work.
 
 
Encinal uses ParentSquare as a secure and safe school
-
home communication network that is Children's Online Privacy Protection Act 
(COPPA) compliant.  Parents will see posts (mess
ages, photos, calendar items, event sign
-
ups, etc.) from their children's teachers and 
school administrators. In addition, teachers use Seesaw as a digital learning platform where parents can view and comment upo
n their 
child's work.
 
 
In addition to the co
re academic subjects, all students attend enrichment classes in world language music, art, library, PE, and a wide 
selection of after school activities. All students learn music, PE, and art from credentialed teachers. 4th and 5th grade stu
dents are 
provid
ed the opportunity to begin instruction in string or band instruments. Students demonstrate their learning several times a ye
ar 
through music performances including the Winter Sing, Spring Musical, and Encinal's Talent Show. The PTO also a variety of af
ter
 
school 
activities ranging from chess and cooking to Mandarin and Lego Club. Encinal students receive a great well
-
rounded education!
 
 
The students also receive a variety of opportunities to participate in many community field trips sponsored by the PTO. F
ifth graders get 
a rare look at the life of an ancient mariner with the ship trip aboard the Balcutha, a ship built in 1886 and presently dock
ed in San 
Francisco's famous Fisherman's' Wharf. Later in the year, the Fifth Graders also experience the diverse 
environment of California's 
wilderness by participating in the YMCA Outdoor School at Camp Jones Gulch. Other grades also visit great sites such as the C
alifornia 
Academy of Science, Sanchez Adobe, Marine Science Institute and Hidden Villa Farm.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Encinal School campus includes a large playfield and blacktop area, classrooms, an art room, two multipurpose rooms, and 
a science lab, as well as 
administration and conference areas. W ith support from our commu
nity, Encinal School was fully modernized in 2000. In 2006, the community approved 
a $91.1 million bond measure to improve district facilities. In the fall of 2010, a new state of the art fourth and fifth
-
grade complex was completed at 
Encinal School, the 
final phase of the campus reconfiguration to become a K
-
 
5 school. The new work consisted of multipurpose building and new 
classrooms. In addition, existing classrooms saw further modernization with new windows, doors, and upgraded FA system. In th
e summer
 
of 2014 the 
carpet in 7 classrooms was replaced and in the summer of 2015 carpet, ceiling and lighting upgrades are planned for another 7
 
classrooms as part of our 
on
-
going modernization efforts. The Encinal campus also includes a sizable school garden. E
ach class maintains a plot throughout the year. Garden lessons 
are coordinated with the California State Standards for the grade level and managed with the help of parent volunteers. The D
istrict takes great efforts 
to ensure that all schools are clean, sa
fe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the Director of Maintenance and Operations and the site Principal conduct 
regular walk
-
throughs to identify and prioritize necessary maintenance projects. The District maintenance staff keeps the school in good
 
repair and 
working order by completing necessary tasks in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repair are 
given the highest priority. Cleaning standards for all schools in the district have been esta
blished. The Principal and Director of Maintenance and 
Operations work closely with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school. The Distric
t annually sets monies aside 
for long
-
term maintenance projects. The distric
t's complete maintenance plan is available at the district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.

students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they receiv
ed a score or not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi

School Safety Plan
 
Encinal's Emergency Site Operation and Safety Plan is updated annually through the office of the 
Associate Principal and approved by our School Site 
Council.  Our latest school safety plan was approved October 2019. This
 
Emergency Plan addresses Encinal School's planned responses to emergency 
situations associated with emergencies and/or disasters. It
 
is designed to be read, understood, and exercised prior to an emergency and integrated into 
the
 
Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS).  A parent safety meeting that highlighted our school plan was held December 
4, 2020 in 
collaboration with Athe
rton PD.
 
 
The plan has been written to encompass most potential emergency situations on school grounds. Situations may occur where stan
dard methods and 
practices may be modified for such circumstances. Nothing contained in the plan should be
 
interpreted as
 
an obstacle to the experience, initiative, and/or 
ingenuity to adapt to the complexities which exist under emergency conditions. Site and Classroom Hazard surveys are conducte
d at the beginning of 
each school year.
 
 
Encinal School follows the San Mateo Co

the campus. Encinal School conduct drills every year in order to be prepared for a situation where this is a dangerous person
 
on campus or in the
 
neighborhood. Drills are scheduled with our School Resource Officer from the Atherton Police Department. Our Student and Pare
nt Handbook is provided 
to each parent at the beginning of the school year and includes an outline of the Big Five Protocols as we
ll as school rules and behavior expectations. All 
staff review these protocols at the beginning of the school year and all teachers review the rules and expectations with stud
ents at the start of each new 
school year.
