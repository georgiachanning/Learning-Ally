All students progress is monitored with the goal of masteringgrade level Common Core Content. 2019 SBAC data shows that over 73% of our students in grades3-5 met or exceeded grade level standards. All grades utilize common assessments to determinemastery of content and to plan next steps in instruction. Students not at grade level receive responseto intervention targeted instruction weekly and may qualify for double dose support in Language Artsand/or math working with Riviera's three hourly intervention teachers. Guided reading, CognitivelyGuided Instruction in math, technology programs including ST Math and Reading A to Z providedifferentiation opportunities in the classroom. Differentiation and individualized student support is keyto student's achievement and our model practice addresses this need! For the past three years,Professional development focus areas include Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), CommonCore English Language Arts and Math Instruction. Best instructional practices focus on anchorstandards in ELA, CGI math practices, experimentation and technological application across thecurriculum. Small group time is a model practice that allows weekly targeted instruction for half of theclass, while the other half participates in enrichment and experimentation in the Visual and PerformingArts (VAPA) Lab and Technology Lab. Teachers utilize professional learning community time to planinstruction, align assessments, monitor students progress and to plan next steps in instruction.  Gradelevels construct academic goals and instructional goals and monitor implementation progress eachyear.

California Assessment of Student Performance andProgressThe California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress(CAASPP) System includes the Smarter Balanced SummativeAssessments (SBAC) for students in the general educationpopulation, and the California Alternate Assessments (CAAs) forstudents with the most significant cognitive disabilities.  Only eligiblestudents may participate in the administration of the CAAs.  CAAsitems are aligned with alternative achievement standards, which arelinked with the Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  CAASPPresults are a measure of how well students are masteringCalifornia's standards in English language arts/literacy (ELA) andmathematics, and are given to grades three through eight and gradeeleven. SBAC tests assess student performance in ELA/Literacy andmathematics utilizing computer-adaptive tests and performancetasks, and CAAs test items are aligned with alternative achievementstandards which are linked with the Common Core State Standards(CCSS).The CAASPP results shown in this report include overall resultscomparing the school, district and state scores as well as theschool's overall score in each applicable subgroup. Results areshown only for subgroups with ten students or more taking the exam.For those categories that are blank in the tables, no students metsubgroup criteria.
