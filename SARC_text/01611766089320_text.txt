About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is 
required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (
LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported i
n an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa
/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members shoul
d contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year
 
2019

The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core cla
sses for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California Conte
nt Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Brookvale has a science lab with state
-
of
-
the
-
art technology and lab equipment. The lab includes lab stations and provides the necessary instructional 
materials to have a complete, work
able lab. Our science prep teachers provide standards
-
based instruction in science, and all students in grades one 
through six receive science instruction. Transitional Kindergarten and Kindergarten students receive science instruction with
 
their classroom
 
teacher.
 
 
Brookvale has updated its multipurpose room to include appropriate seating for students at lunchtime including a sun shade st
ructure to protect students 
from sun exposure.  Our facilities are used on a regular basis by outside agencies, and we d
evelop regular partnerships with community agencies.
 
 
During the 2017
-
18 school year, the school updated its infrastructure for technology so that the whole school is wireless and utilizes a high
 
speed wireless 
system.  We replaced carpet in some of the cl
assrooms during the summer of 2012 and replaced the library carpet during the summer of 2013.   The 
Brookvale PTA works with the principal and has been instrumental in improving the exterior of the school by providing benches
 
and a memorial garden. 
It also
 
removed the ice plant in the front of the school and provided additional outdoor seating and picnic umbrellas for aesthetic v
alue and shade. In the 
summer of 2008, Brookvale school completed many renovations for overall school improvement, including a new
 
fire
-
alarm system; new door locks; new 
roofing and shingles; a new heating, ventilation, and air
-
conditioning system; energy
-
efficient windows; new flooring; new restrooms that are compliant 
with the Americans with Disabilities Act; a new reception area i
n the front office; new cabinetry in the staff room; and exterior lighting for safety and 
visibility. In the summer of 2009, we resurfaced the blacktop and new tables and an improved eating area were provided for st

funded a new fen
ce in the front of the school to ensure improved student safety.  During the summer of 2017, FUSD added on an 8 classroom win
g to 
the campus to support the enrollment growth in the district.  The facilities are state of art with LED lighting, green propos
a
l classrooms and state of the 
art technology and materials.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by 

Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report. Since that time, those
 
conditions m

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cog

School Site Council (SSC), site leadership team and safety committee annually.  The las

2019. In the 2019

20 school year, the Brookvale safety staff was trained in trauma care and  first aid procedures in the event of mass casualit

to include school wide discipline procedures and strategies to prevent serious discipline issues on campus.  
Every year, Brookvale participates in the "GREAT SHAKEOUT" to practice earthquake and safety procedures.  Brookvale has hired
 
yard duty personnel 
to 
help secure campus safety and has implemented an electronic visitor sign in system to ensure that the school is aware of ever
yone who enters the school 
campus.  Brookvale works closely with the Fremont Police Department to ensure that their safety plan 
is appropriate and effective in preventing and/or 
responding to safety issues on campus.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take 
some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach.  Below is the 
amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 day
s
 
2017
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations these days are sometimes reduced.
