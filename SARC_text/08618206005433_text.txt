Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Welcome to Pine Grove Elementary School, Home of the Panthers. Our vision and mission is to "inspire all students to 
attain their full creative and academic potential by recognizing, valuing, and developing each student's 
strengths and 
talents."  We strive to meet the needs of all students with rigorous and relevant learning opportunities while providing a 
positive and inviting school climate for students and families. Teachers work collaboratively in Professional Learning 
Communities to analysis data and plan lessons based on identified targeted growth needs. Our goal is for students to 
become academically, socially and emotionally prepared for the next level of their learning as 21st Century citizens.
 
 
Description:
 
Pine Grove is located in Del Norte County, the most northern county in California. We are one of eight elementary schools. 
We are surrounded primarily by single family homes, three mobile home parks and a very large low income apartment 
complex. Most eithe
r students ride the bus to school daily or their parents transport them, very few students walk or ride 
their bikes to school. Pine Grove's current enrollment is 322 students in grades Transitional Kindergarten through fifth 
grade. This year we have 15 cla
ssroom teachers, a school counselor on site three days a week, and a part
-
time credentialed 
physical education teacher. Pine Grove also houses a preschool program and a Head Start program each serving students 
ages 3
-
5 years old and both offering an am and
 
pm session.  Our After School program provides approximately 90 students 
daily with academic support, enrichment activities and a meal.
 
 
Our goals for this year include increasing student achievement while closing the achievement gap between our English 
o
nly students and students within our targeted subgroups, improving school climate, increasing student attendance and 
providing more opportunities for family engagement. Our Professional Learning Community collaboration time is focused 
on improving teaching
 
practices in reading, writing and mathematics through the use of BeGlad strategies, Step
-
Up to 
Writing, guided reading instruction, MTSS implementation, and Kim Sutton math strategies. We use a variety of 
assessments including California State Summative A
ssessment, Interim Benchmark assessments, Aimsweb assessments, 
district writing assessments and a variety of teacher designed assessments to identify targeted lesson goals. Teachers are 
able to provide small group intervention instruction daily when their 
other students are either participating in PE or in the 
computer class. Technology is integrated throughout academic instruction across CORE subjects to better prepare 
students, enrich their learning opportunities, promote digital citizenship and provide i
ndividualized targeted practice to 
meet the variety of educational needs.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Asse
ssment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] 
and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standar
ds [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University,
 
or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Our School Safety Plan was reviewed and approved by our School Site Council on October 23, 2019. On November 19, 
2019, the Comprehensive Safety Plan, Crisis Response Team and Classroom Buddies charts was shared with staff during a 
staff meeting.
 
Our staff protocol in any emergency is to  keep the kids safe and call the office. Regular emergency drills 
are conducted monthly. Pine Grove has a large number of new staff members this year so we are reviewing procedures 
and protocols on a regular basis
. The details of what to do in a specific type of emergency are outlined in our safety 
handbooks. This includes a description of emergency notification systems, map of the school and evacuation routes, Crisis 
Response Team assignments and buddy classrooms.
 
The types of emergencies covered include bomb threat, lock down, 
threat of tsunami, flood, earthquake, severe weather (shelter in place), gunman on/near campus (lock down), fire, off 
campus evacuation and emergency dismissal (on or off campus). The plan a
nd emergency handbooks are updated each 
fall and reviewed with faculty, School Site Council, and presented to family members in January. These handbooks are 
kept in Red Emergency Backpacks located in every classroom.  Class lists and student emergency cont
act lists are also 
stored inside the red backpacks.
