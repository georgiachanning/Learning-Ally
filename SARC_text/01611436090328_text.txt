W
e are proud to present our annual School Accountability Report Card for the 2019
-
20 year. We 
publish this report every year to share important facts about our school with the public we serve. 
It is our 

about our teachers and support staff who help make learning possible. In this report, you will find 
information about our teachers, students, test scores, resources
, and finances. Many qualities 
contribute to making a public school successful, and no single report can fully describe them all. 

alongside data for other school
s at the same grade level in the district and state. We believe that 
viewing the facts about our school compared to other schools in the district and state provides the 
most insight.
 
 

s about our students, and 



 
including 
how much we spend per studen
t compared to the district as a whole and the state. Open 

responsibility we take seriously. We hope this report will generate a dialogue between members 
of our communi
ty and school leadership. We invite you to join us in this discussion. To get involved 
at our school, please contact our school office.

DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district
 
and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Intern
et access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use 
restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a 
workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a 
workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abo
ut the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal
 
or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instr
uctional Materials (School Year 2019

Williams legislation calls for the schools to have enough books in core classes for all students and asks districts to reveal
 
whether those books are 
presenting information outlined in the California content standar
ds.  Textbook materials are adopted by the school board following a rotating adoption 
cycle for subject specific state adopted textbooks and instructional materials.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district administers a scheduled maintena
nce program to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well maintained and in good repair. A work 
order process alerts district personnel of any maintenance needed to be performed and ensures that emergencies are given the 
highest priority.
 
 
Safety i
ssues are the top priority for Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors inspect school sites continually 
and complete repairs 
in a timely manner. They use a work order process to ensure an efficient, prioritized repair process. The dist
rict maintenance staff has indicated that 
100% of all toilets on school grounds are in working order.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facil
ities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System
, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and gr
ade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive
 
disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

School Safety Plan
 

 
Washington Elementary was constructed in 1952, and has since received extensive remodeling and retrofitting. The campus 
covers two acres and consists of 14 permanent classrooms, seven bungalows across the street, a library, two staff rooms, a ca
fetorium, 
a large playground, 
an art room and a science room and an English language development classroom. We also have a dedicated parent space.  During 
the summer of 2008, 
electricity producing solar panels were installed on the roof of the main building. This pr

supports teaching and learning through its ample classroom and playground space.  One unusual feature of the playground is ou
r mature forest, which 
includes 4 play structures as well as pl
atforms and logs for students to explore.
 
 
The safety of students and staff is our primary concern. We have a full time Campus Security Monitor who is stationed in the 
McKinley Avenue zone to 
monitor traffic between the bungalows and the main 
building.   A variety of people visit the campus to volunteer in the classrooms and participate in 
school events. During lunch, recesses, and before
-
and
-
after school, staff members, administrators, and safety officer supervise students and school 
grounds t
o ensure an orderly, safe environment. The school is always fully compliant with all rules, laws, and regulations concerning 
state earthquake 
standards and hazardous materials. Earthquake and fire drill are held monthly, and intruder drills are held at lea
st once a year.
 
 
Safety procedures, including elements of our Comprehensive Safe School Plan, are reviewed with school and district staff at t
he start of each school year. 
The plan was last updated and reviewed with school staff in spring 2019.  It contain
s information for the health and safety of students and includes 
emergency plans and procedures, as well as contact information, goals, and  student expectations.
