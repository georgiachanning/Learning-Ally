By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Camerado Springs Middle School is a school that is a safe and positive place to be, a place where students and staff are 
proud to belong.  It is a place where students and teachers are respec
ted and valued, where teachers and staff work as a 
team to support our students and each other.  Camerado Springs is a 6
-
8 middle school located in Cameron Park, CA.  The 
current enrollment of Camerado Springs Middle School is approximately 520 students.  
Camerado Springs Middle School 
opened in September 1976 as the first middle school in the Buckeye Union School District.  The campus had a full 
modernization of the facilities in 2007
-
2008, improving classroom facilities, technology upgrades, and improving
 
the 
grounds to make it ADA compliant. In the Spring of 2017, Camerado Springs was recognized as a Gold Ribbon School by 
the California Department of Education and in the Summer of 2019, Camerado Springs became an International 
Baccalaureate (IB) candidate
 
school.
 
 
We are dedicated to creating a learning environment that enables students to achieve their maximum potential in 
academic performance, critical thinking skills, expressive talents, physical development, social and emotional growth, and 
use of tech
nology.  At Camerado Springs we have high expectations for student achievement.  We are committed to 
providing students with a solid academic background in a safe and supportive environment.  We challenge students 
through an academic curriculum that requir
es them to apply skills and knowledge to meet district and state standards.  
Our intent is to build an academic foundation that will allow students to be successful in high school and beyond.  In 
addition to academics, students participate in an active exp
loratory program and have access to a variety of extra
-
curricular activities that include clubs, after school events, and sports.  Students in the middle grades need to become 
increasingly responsible and independent as they prepare for high school. We hel
p students develop responsibility by 
providing binder reminders and online grades accessible to students and parents so that students can track their own 
academic progress. We recognize students for responsible citizenship and academic achievement. When st
udents are not 
acting responsibly, the student, parent and teachers meet to clarify the situation and develop a plan to assist the student.
 
 
While we emphasize academics, we understand that early adolescence is a time of change, and students need guidance 
and support to succeed. During the middle grades, students need to feel included, welcomed, safe, and secure at school. 
We have a consistent and well
-
communicated discipline plan and a reward program in place for students who exhibit good 
behavior.
 
 
Studen
t safety is made a priority with regular drills and safety practices.  These are coordinated with local emergency 
responders to ensure their effectiveness.  The emotional safety of students is also a priority and is addressed in a number 
of ways.  There is
 
no tolerance for bullying, teasing or the like.  Students work to create an environment that is positive 
and safe.  They play an active role in speaking against bullying and teasing in positive ways. Teachers also reach out to 
students to build relationsh
ips that create connectedness to the school while our counselor assists individual students 
who struggle both academically and emotionally.
 
 
Camerado Springs strives to develop a community of inquiring lifelong learners through a rigorous curriculum.  We o
ffer 
challenging programs with high expectations that are based on student needs. Our program encourages intercultural 
understanding and diversity in order to help create a more peaceful community as we prepare for an increasingly 
connected global society.

The Camerado Springs community, which includes students, staff, families, and community members, truly believes that 
every child can reach their full potential.  We work together in a collaborative manner to provide an education that will 
nurture and 
build the academic strengths of each child.  Our dedicated and innovative teaching staff shares in leadership 
responsibilities, knowing that solid research based planning is the key to a quality academic program.
 
 
Camerado Springs strives to be a 
school where all students are welcome, safe, respected and challenged to achieve.

however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievem

scores.

part of the Parent Teacher Organization (PTO). Parent edu
cation opportunities are offered at various points in the school
