Mission statement
 
Canalino Elementary School provides our students with a motivating and thought
-
provoking 
educational program that meets the needs of the whole child. We encourage all students to reach 
the
ir highest potential as confident, respectful, problem

long learners. We achieve this 
through strong and unique connections between school, home, and community.
 
 
Classrooms are equipped with Chromebooks and charging carts to enable technology 
based 
instruction daily.. Canalino has a Positive Behavioral Support Plan with Four Expectations 
consistently reinforced in every classroom and area of the school. They are: Be Safe, Be Respectful, 
Make Good Decisions, and Solve Problems. Second Step socia
l and emotional curriculum has been 
added to continue to develop positive character traits in children.
 
 
Canalino relies on community, family support, and volunteers for tutoring and small group 
instruction. The Parents for Canalino's mission 
statement is as follows: The Mission of Parents for 
Canalino is to promote and support the high quality educational and enrichment programs offered 
at Canalino School.  These programs will encourage the development of critical thinkers, 
enthusiastic learne
rs and responsible citizens.  Parents for Canalino will encourage parent 
involvement through various volunteer opportunities at Canalino School.  The staff, students and 
parents will support one another, treat and respect each other as valued individuals.
 
 
The local universities generously provide well
-
trained pre
-
professional, paraprofessionals, and 
student teachers to work in the classrooms. Many of these students have become teachers at 
Canalino.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to 
publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to pre
pare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consis
tent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more informatio
n about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school prin
cipal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Inst
ructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Carpinteria Unified School District selects textbooks and other instructional materials from the most recent list of Standard
s
-
based materials adopted by 
the State Board of Education. Students have current textbook
s in the core areas of the curriculum and textbooks are consistent with the content and 
cycles of the curriculum frameworks adopted by the State Board of Education. The District has affirmed that each pupil, inclu
ding English Learners, has 
their own textbo
ok to use in class and to take home. Every student has access to his or her own textbook for each subject area.
 
 
Carpinteria Unified School District adopted a new K
-
5 Language Arts program during the 2017
-
18 school year and was purchased and implemented in
 
the 2018
-
19 school year. Kindergarten through third graders use Wonders, by McMillan McGraw Hill. Fourth and fifth grade students use 
Ready Gen, by 
Pearson. In the 2015
-
16 school year, teachers across elementary sites piloted math programs, and enthusiast
ically recommended the Bridges math 
program, from the Math Learning Center. It is now being implemented with rave reviews in all classrooms. A new science progra
m, Full Option Science 
System, by Pearson,  was adopted in the 2017
-
18 school year and was purc
hased and implemented in the 2018

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Canalino School was built in 1955. The school is well maintained by three 
full
-
time equivalent (FTE) custodians: one during the day, and two in the 
evening. District facilities, maintenance, and grounds managers adequately repair, replace, and provide major upkeep to the s
chool. Future 
modernization would update restrooms, and a
dd additional power for technology usage. There is an extensive asphalt blacktop, large grass play area 
with play equipment, and 39 well equipped classrooms. All rooms, including bathrooms, are handicapped accessible. The facilit
y has an office area, after
-
school rooms, cafeteria/auditorium, and multimedia center.  All classrooms have access to wireless printers at five locations
 
on campus. These systems 
reduce the electrical load at the site. A county Medical Therapy Unit is housed in a portable classroom,
 
which provides physical therapy for qualified 
students. Playground equipment is checked regularly for safety, as are the classrooms. Earthquake and fire drills are practic
ed monthly, and each 
classroom has an emergency pack stocked with first aid supplies
. The transportation supervisor conducts a school bus safety program yearly. Supervisors 
are assigned to the parking lots during arrival and dismissal  times, and supervise recess and lunch activities. Recently com
pleted facility improvements 
included an a
dditional handicapped drinking fountain, which was completed on February 22, 2008. In October 2013, irrigation was installed 
in one of the 
green belts between wings 1 and 2. In the summer of 2016, the cafeteria/multi
-
purpose room was remodeled, with new fl
ooring, paint, tables, and 
benches, using the first of the Measure U bond money voters had approved in 2014. The Canalino Preschool was moved to a fence
d in area of the school 
requiring upgrades in the room and outside play area. Both projects were Distric
t funded. Our school provides a safe, clean, and functional environment 
for learning through proper facilities maintenance and campus supervision. The principal and custodial staff work closely tog
ether to maintain the campus 
environment. We operate an onl
ine work order system that maintenance crews prioritize and see to it that the school is safe, clean, and in good repair. 
The Canalino Preschool was located in a regular Kindergarten room and they were using the regular school play area. The stude
nts only 
went outside 
when no other children were using the area. It was determined that the Preschool needed to be moved to a room used by another
 
class, but had a totally 

e been upgraded. The play area has had a swing, sandbox, 
irrigation, and benches added. The program is now functioning and increasing in size because of the improvements.
 
 
The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which pro
vides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this in
cludes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smart
er Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
