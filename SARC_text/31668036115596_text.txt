About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Dry Creek Joint Elementary School District held a Public Hearing on September 19, 2019, and de
termined that each school within the District has sufficient 
and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the 
State of California. All 
students, including English learners, are giv
en their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for 
use in the classroom and to take home. In grades 6
-
8 each student receives a textbook available to keep at home and has a class set of textbooks t
o use 
at school. Online access to textbooks is also an available option for mathematics, English Language Arts/English Language Dev
elopment (ELA/ELD), and 
History Social
-
Science in grades kindergarten through eight. Instructional materials are adopted acco
rding to a cycle developed by the State Department 
of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are
 
reviewed by all teachers 
and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a 
selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are 
available for parent examination at each school site, the district office, and in some cases online prior to adoption. The ta
ble displays information about 
the quali
ty, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used in the school.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Olive Grove opened in 1999, with construction completed in January 2000. Routine and scheduled maintenance are conducted as n
eeded and per product 
manufacturers' specifications. The sta
ff on site typically generates work orders using a web based work order system and are addressed in an expedient 
manner.
 
 
Students have access to a complete facility with a library, computer lab, playing field, large playground and apparatus area,
 
a state
-
of
-
the
-
art 
multipurpose room, and outdoor amphitheater area. The school has an outstanding safety record that can, in part, be contribut
ed to the pride the 
community has taken in the facility. Parent support and school
-
wide character education, in addition
 
to the consistent, progressive disciplinary program, 
have also helped make the school a safe place for students to attend.
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe and functional. District maintenance ensures that
 
the r
epairs necessary to keep 
the school sites in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure ef
ficient service and that 
emergency repairs are given the highest priority.

Parents are a key component of our school's success.  Between 10 to 15 parents volunteer at the school every day.  Parental i
nvolvement is encouraged 
through the school's Parent Teacher Student Association (PTSA) and 
through opportunities for volunteering in the classroom, library, computer lab, and 
through school
-
wide programs such as the art and music docent programs. The PTSA has monthly meetings and supports a number of school
-
wide 
activities to benefit our student
s in the classroom with instruction. This includes providing educational materials, funding field trips, supporting 
technology use in the classroom, and adding resources to the library.  As part of the community, the PTSA has supported the S
pring Carnival,
 
the Harvest 
Festival, building the shade structure, and designing the artistic tile "Wall of Memories" reflecting our history and our foc
us on character education. The 
Watch DOG program, also sponsored by our PTSA, is a volunteer organization that encoura
ges dads and other positive, role models to be active on a 
daily basis at the school.  As a school
-
wide Title 1 school for 2019/2020, Olive Grove is providing parent and community building events to help families 
promote learning in reading and computer pr
ogramming in their homes.  The School Site Council also surveys parents to gather data on parent 
involvement. The ELAC/Title 1 Parent Committee evaluates school programs and advises staff on how to better serve English Lea
rners at the school.  
Every year, 
the ELAC/Title 1 Committee joins other area schools in hosting and organizing the Antelope World Fair to showcase the many cu
ltures 
supporting Olive Grove Elementary and the surrounding community.
 
 
You are encouraged to be involved with activities on the O
live Grove campus. Please volunteer your time either in the classroom or become a member 
of one of the advisory councils such as the School Site Council and the ELAC/Title 1 Committee.
