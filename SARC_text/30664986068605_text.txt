By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Oka Elementary School is committed to providing an educational foundation and environment which fosters positive self
-
esteem and high levels of academic rigor.  Furthermore, our mission is to support learning so our students become 
productive, r
esponsible, caring members of society. Teachers, administrators, support staff, and parents are dedicated to 
assisting students in achieving this mission.
 
 
Instruction in Oka's classrooms leverages Fountain Valley School District's Signature Practices.  In
 
English
-
Language Arts, 
this includes a Balanced Literacy approach using a Reader's Workshop model to provide targeted and differentiated 
instruction for all students.  In Math, this includes the implementation of Cognitively Guided Instructional practices
, which 
promote a greater depth of problem solving, understanding, and math reasoning.  District
-
level and school
-
site level 
professional development opportunities have supported these initiatives, and teachers have been able to work in 
collaborative teams
 
within and across grade levels to support implementation.  Data analysis is evolving to provide a 
greater emphasis on planning and implementing appropriately targeted instruction for all students.
 
 
Students are guided by specific expectations that promote
 
Respect, Responsibility, and Safety, known as, "The Wolfpack 
Way."  This matrix of behavior expectations is visible across the Oka campus, and is utilized by all staff in helping promote
 
consistency in messaging and communication, toward furthering studen
t successes on a daily basis.  In addition, the 
"Values in Action" program, which has been part of Oka for multiple decades, is still entrenched into the campus 
-
 
with 
the seven core values emphasized throughout each school
-
year.  Those core values are Int
egrity, Respect, Cooperation, 
Perseverance, Compassion, Initiative, and a Positive Mental Attitude.  Trimester Awards and other student recognition 
programs are aligned with these initiatives, and allow Oka to develop strong character in students  that wil
l be serve as a 
foundation for their success.
 
 
Teachers, staff, and administration work from the principle that students come first.  The educational programs at Oka 
are tailored to meet the needs of changing student populations.  Oka is dedicated to ensur
ing the academic success of 
every student by providing them with a comprehensive education experience that becomes an integral part of their life.  
All students receive instruction using core curriculum that has been adopted by the California State Board o
f Education 
and approved by the Fountain Valley School District Board of Education.  Instruction is enriched through a variety of special
 
programs and instructional strategies that work toward supporting the needs of students with diverse needs.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Oka Elementary School was originally constructed in 1970 and has been thoroughly modernized over the last several years. 
The campus is currently comprised of 24 permanent classrooms, a computer lab, a library, and a spacious playground. 
Recent upgrades to 
the school include installation of perimeter lighting and a public address system, as well as improved 
electrical and data circuits. Smart Boards have been installed in all rooms. The facility supports teaching and learning 
through its ample classroom and 
recreational space.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 

Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the District. Basic cleaning operations are
 
performed on a daily 
basis throughout the school year with an emphasis on classrooms and restrooms. A joint effort between students and 
staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

op 
sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair:
 

maintenance functions occ
urring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered 
by Fountain Valley School District's Maintenance & Operations Department to ensure that school grounds and facilities 
remain in excellent repair. A work order pro
cess is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. Emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority; repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received
.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
Deferred maintenance inc
ludes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. Fountain Valley School District did not participate in the State School Deferred Maintenance 
Budget Program. Fountain Valley School Di
strict sets aside funds each year to specifically address deferred maintenance 
needs. The passing of Measure O provided additional, much
-
needed funds for these types of projects

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The safety of students and staff is a primary focus at Oka.  Students are supervised before school, during recess and lunch 
periods, and after school by teachers, administrators, trained aides, and classified staff.  During the school day, all 
individuals 
entering the Oka campus must report to the front office immediately.  All visitors to the Oka campus must 
check
-
in and check
-
out using the Raptor Visitor Management System which helps to elevate the level of security on school 
campuses

The school is in co
mpliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake 
standards. The Safety Committee reviews and updates the Safe School Action Plan annually by March 1.  Any and all 
revisions to the plan are immediately co
mmunicated to classified and certificated staff.
 
 
The Goals and Objectives in the Safe School Action Plan focus on three areas:
 
1)  A school climate characterized by caring and connectedness between students
-
staff
-
parents,
 
2)  The safe and orderly 
physical environment of the school, and
 
3)  The health and wellness of Oka students.
 
 
To supplement the Safe School Action Plan, Oka also has a Disaster Preparedness plan that includes steps for ensuring 
student and staff safety, during an incident.  These
 
possible incidents include earthquake, fire, weather related, and 
lockdown.  Drills to support each of these possibilities are conducted throughout the year on a rotating basis to allow for 
practice and repetition to help students follow directions.  Oka 
staff participated in professional development related to 
safety during the 2019
-
20 school year.

Staff development is a priority in the Fountain Valley School District.  We value the impact highly skilled instructors have 
on student achievement. Three days are reserved specifically for this purpose for 
all employees in FVSD, and an additional 
three days are reserved specifically for professional development related to supporting ELA, Math, and Science.  During 
the school year, there are numerous other opportunities for teachers to teachers attend trainin
g either before, during, or 
after the school day.  Throughout the District, there are both school
-
level and district
-
wide initiatives.  Recent training 
initiatives in Fountain Valley School District and Oka Elementary School include:
 
 

 
Cognitive Guided Inst
ruction (CGI) Mathematics
 

 
Balanced Literacy/Reader's Workshop

In addition to identified days within the school year calendar, Oka has also taken steps to increase the number of 
opportunities teachers have to collaborate with each other.  There are over 25 days with specific times identified for 
facilitated articulation and peer collaboration.  Site
-
specific professional development opportunities have been 
determined through the w
ork of the Oka School Leadership Team.  Oka teachers especially enjoy opportunities to learn 
in group settings, and also participate in individualized opportunities for mentoring.  Teachers are supported in multiple 
ways, including principal
-
teacher meetin
gs, peer coaching, and use of FVSD TOSA personnel.  With the help of an expert 
educator, Oka staff have engaged in ongoing professional development designed to support the implementation of 
Reader's Workshop.  The majority of these training sessions take p
lace during the instructional day, with teachers being 
provided release time to participate.
 
 
Oka continues to be recognized for its efforts to promote student learning and development.  Numerous Oka teachers 
have recently completed a two
-
year intensive pa
rtnership, with the Cotsen Foundation's Art of Teaching mentoring 
program which provides extensive professional development opportunities and individualized coaching for participating 
teachers. Oka is proud to maintain a committed affiliation to continue t
hese learning opportunities moving forward into 
the upcoming years.
 
 
In addition, other targeted areas of Professional Development include: Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI) in Math; ST 
Math; Site specific initiatives, such as School Safety, and various
 
Special Education curriculum supports.
