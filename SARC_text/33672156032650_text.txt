By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Jackson Elementary School opened its doors in 1959 and has proudly served the surrounding community for several 
generations, with many parents of current students at Jackson who attended themselves as students in their elementary 
sc
hool years.  Jackson serves a diverse population of students and families who care about learning and being prepared 
for their futures. Our school adheres to the concept of Professional Learning Communities, which includes school 
administration, teachers, 
instructional support staff, students and parents. We are a school wide Title I and an AVID 
Elementary School, working collaboratively to meet the common goal of preparing all students for college and career, as 
well as attending to their needed emotional 
support and building character for a successful future.
 
 
All Jackson school goals are in support of the District goals under the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP): Provide 
high
-
quality teaching and learning environments for all students; Prepare all
 
students to be college, career and world 
ready upon graduation; Fully engage students, parents, and the community in support of short and long
-
term educational 
outcomes. All strategies included in the goals will integrate best practices and research
-
based
 
instructional strategies to 
support and increase the proficiency of English Learner students and students with disabilities. Specific strategies include:
 
professional development in reading, writing and mathematics instruction, release time for teachers t
o participate in the 
Cycle of Informative Inquiry (analyze, plan, act, reflect), strategies to increase student attendance and engagement, and 
parent involvement activities to assist parents with academic support of their children in the home.
 
 
Our school 
mission reflects this work: "Our mission as a school community is to challenge all students to reach or exceed 
California Common Core State standards in all academic areas. As a professional learning community the Jackson staff, 
students, and parents accep
t the shared responsibility to ensure that when students leave our school, they are prepared 
to be critical and divergent thinkers and possess character traits that will lead to success in a global society."

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the
 
total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Jackson, we encourage the productive involvement of parents and family members to support student success. We 
cannot do the important work that needs to be done without our partners on the home front.  Jackson encourages parents 
to volunteer in the clas
srooms and in other school operations.  There are many opportunities for parental involvement at 
Jackson Elementary School. Parents are encouraged to be actively involved in Jackson's PTA, School Site Council, and 
English Learner Advisory Committee.  These
 
parent organizations have sponsored and participated in enrichment activities 
like campus beautification and holiday arts events.  Parents are invited to attend Parent Curriculum Nights, student 
performance events, and visit the school for special events 
such as PTA family events, our holiday program, Spring Open 
House and Carnival, and our awards assemblies. We strongly encourage parents to volunteer in the classroom or become 
a class helper for special classroom events or field trips. For parents who wis
h to volunteer in the classroom, a Parent 
Volunteer Orientation is held at the beginning of the year to review how to complete the required screening, how to 
volunteer effectively and to answer any questions parents may have.  Parents of kindergarten and t
ransitional 
kindergarten students are also invited to a Kindergarten Orientation prior to the start of school to review curriculum 
expectations, classroom organization, homework, school schedules, and behavioral expectations in the classroom, on the 
playgr
ound, and in the cafeteria.   Teachers and parents communicate with each other through District email, conferences 
set up throughout the year and daily in
-
person and phone communication. Many teachers also utilize Class Dojo to 
effectively and continuously
 
communicate with parents. School wide communication with parents is obtained through 
auto dialer, auto email messages and flyers/newsletters.  Parents are asked to be involved in supporting their children in 
completing homework and maintaining good attend
ance and on
-
time arrival. The parent involvement contact at the 
school is JoLynn Barnes, Principal, and can be contacted at 951
