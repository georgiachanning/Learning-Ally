By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Curriculum Framework adopted by the State Board of Education in the following subject areas: mathematics, science, 
history/social science, and English/language arts, pursuant to settlement the of Williams vs. the Sta

aligned 
textbooks and instructional materials in the core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home.
 
 
Textbooks us
ed in all schools in the Susanville School District are purchased from the State
-
adopted list. Teachers in the 
District form textbook adoption committees to decide which series best meets the learning needs of our students. All 
students are provided texts 
for classroom and homework practices.  Additionally, newly adopted materials include online 
support, tutoring and assignment potential for all students in both English and Spanish.  The textbooks are evaluated for 
currency and quality on a regular basis.  
NGSS textbooks are expected to be evaluated and purchased by the summer of 
2020.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP]
 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight
 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant co
gnitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or program
s 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State prio

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There are many 
opportunities for parents to become involved at Meadow View ranging from school
-
wide leadership roles, 
School Site Council membership, and volunteering in the classrooms. Meadow View also has a Parent Teacher Association 
(PTA) that conducts a number of fun
draising events to provide extra opportunities for our students. Involvement in field 
trips, assemblies, and student awards events are other important ways for parents to become involved with the school. 
Annually, parents are invited to be a part of the Di
strict's LCAP committee to help prioritize the District's goals and actions.
 
 
The most valuable parent involvement practices are to meet regularly with teachers for conferences, maintain frequent 
communication with staff concerning the progress of your chi

behavioral goals for all students.
 
 
Meadow View utilizes a parent
-
dialing service (SchoolWise) to communicate with parents regarding important events on 
campus and about student life.  This communication
 
is sent through e
-
mails, direct calls, and text messages. The Meadow 
View Staff in grades 4 & 5, post student grades and scores on an online grading book so that parents can view their child's 
progress throughout the school year.

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The safety of students, staff, and visitors is of primary importance at this school. The School Emergency Response Plan 
was most recently reviewed, updated, and discussed with the Board of Trustees in March of 2019.  The plan was re
viewed 
with school faculty in October 2019. The Plan covers safety procedures for natural disasters and other emergency 
situations and includes various emergency drills, lock
-
down procedures, intruder procedures, and other emergency 
actions in response to 
safety threats. To keep students prepared, the school implements at least one fire evacuation drill 
per month, an annual bus evacuation drill, and one earthquake drill. All visitors to the school are required to sign in at th
e 

ag at all times; new protocols were implemented in the fall of 2018, requiring parents and 
visitors to sign
-
in through VIP Pass, an electronic sign
-
in process which allows the school to track and monitor all visitors 
on campus.  This is in an effort to fur
ther increase campus security.
 
 
A very important part of our overall efforts to maintain a safe school is based on our partnership with parents and 
individual staff members. Staff members contact the school office when they observe practices, situations, o
r equipment 
conditions that could threaten the safety of our students. In addition, the school employs a licensed vocational nurse in 
the health office, and both custodial and groundskeeper staffs help us monitor and correct any safety concerns on the 
camp
us.  The School Safety Plan is reviewed regularly and changes are made as needed.

The major area of focus this year in the Susanville School District is on improving student instruction using the Common 
Core State Standards adopted for the core subjects. New 
Mathematics materials were adopted in 2014 and staff have 
been engaged in a variety of professional development activities related to the new program. Additionally, staff has 
continued to advance their understanding of peer collaboration/observation and im
plementation of new technology into 
their daily curriculum. New English Language Arts (ELA) materials were adopted in 2016 and the ELA staff have been 
immersed in professional development to master the new program. New Social Studies textbooks were purchas
ed in the 
summer of 2019 and training is slated to follow.

-
2015 school 
year in an effort to provide more time for teachers to work together and learn new material during the school year. Staff 
will continue to effectively use these tr
aining days to familiarize themselves with new practices and new materials as
