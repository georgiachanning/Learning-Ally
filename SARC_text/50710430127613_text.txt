By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
2019/10
 
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 12, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbo
oks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or b
oth, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home.
 
 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available
. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the 
district office prior 
to adoption.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California
 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [
ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State St
andards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univer
sity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The staff and administration at Lucas Elementary Dual Language Academy are committed to providing a safe and secure 
environment for students and employees.  Our 
SAFE SCHOOL PLAN is designed to assist staff and students in preparing 
for emergencies, managing emergency response efforts, and maintaining a safe school environment.  Additionally, it will 
assist our school in providing a safe and civil learning environm
ent. This plan has been developed in compliance with 
California Code of Regulations, Title V, Education, Section 560 and is based on input from administrators, teachers, 
paraprofessionals, clerical staff, custodians, and other staff, parents, students, and
 
law enforcement representatives.  The 
major goal of this plan is to assist our school site in preparing for the potential of emergency situations.
 
 

d list of proposed 
campus improvements, various school/district statistics are reviewed on an annual basis.  These statistics are related to 
the following: attendance, crime, disciplinary measures, counseling services, health services, and student outcomes
. The 
following are strategies and programs implemented in order to help provide and maintain a high level of security:
 
 

 
Employees are trained on the scenarios addressed in the Comprehensive School Safety Plan
 

 
SRO's are called periodically to observe the 
traffic patterns during arrival and dismissal in order to ensure traffic 
flow surrounding the school.

The school has continued to implement a Safety Student Patrol (Owl Patrol) to help with the crossing of students, 
parents, staff, and visitors in the morn
ing and dismissal at both our Drop Off and Pick Up zones. Owl Patrol consists 
of students and a supervising adult.
 

 
The Safe and Civil Committee meets to review all safety and security procedures and make any necessary 
recommendations and changes.
 

 
In order 
to ensure that students engage in safe behavior, the school has implemented Multi
-
Tiered Systems of 
Support in Academics (Response To Intervention {RTI}),
 

 
Behavior (Nurture Heart and Positive Behavior Intervention Supports {PBIS} programs) and Social/Emoti
onal 
Support (Social Skills Facilitator {SSF} , Student Support
 

 
Specialist {SSS}, Mental Health Clinician).
 

 
Security has been increased by making sure all parents of Pre
-
School through 6th grade students sign in and walk 
through the main office.
 

 
Ongoing as
sessments of the campus are conducted by the lead custodian, cafeteria personnel, and other staff and 
reported to Administration.
 

 
All the staff is trained each year on child abuse reporting procedures, blood
-
borne pathogens.
 
 
In order to be compliant in pr
oviding and ensuring a safe and orderly school environment conducive to learning (EC 
35294.2), Lucas Elementary will focus on the following three components; #1. (Positive School Climate) Promoting and 
sustaining a positive school climate through the devel
opment of a comprehensive program which includes ways that 
develop a culture which promotes equity, safety, respect and opportunity for all. Through this comprehensive program, 
Lucas will work with staff, students and parents to create a sense of community
, which demonstrates compassionate, 
responsible, and ethical behavior as a community of learners. This is all supported through a process in building and 
maintaining a positive and safe school climate which includes Safe and Civil School, Family Engagement
, Positive Behavior 
Intervention Support System (PBIS). #2. (Physical Environment) We are aware that one of the aspects of a safe school 
environment is the quality of the security and maintenance of the school grounds. The safety and appearance of the scho
ol 
grounds are likely to make an immediate impression on students, parents, and the community. Providing a safe 
environment allows us to nurture, in each student, the desire to contribute and to make meaning out of life. The 
opportunity to improve in this 
area will be based on continuing to create a school environment that is inviting and 
promotes safety, pride, sense of ownership and freedom from fear. #3. (Disaster Preparedness) Safe and Civil Schools 
promotes an annual evaluation of safety preparedness i
ncluding emergency procedures. Staff and students need to feel 
adequately prepared to deal with natural disasters, medical emergencies, and student behavior emergencies. The 
opportunity to improve in this area will be based on ensuring all staff and studen
ts are prepared in case of an emergency 
by conducting monthly fire drills, as well as lock
-
down and earthquake drills twice or three times a year.

Staff development is a critical component to teacher and student success, and Ceres Unified School District 
is dedicated 
to a variety of profession development opportunities for staff. During the 2017
-
2018 school year, the Lucas had 5 
professional development days.  During the 2018
-
2019 school year, 10 collaboration/early release days and 5 professional 
developm
ent days were planned. During the 2019
-
2020 school year 5 professional development days and 10 
collaboration/early release days have been planned.
 
 
At Lucas Elementary teachers are provided with learning opportunities during staff meetings, release days, o
n some 
minimum days and professional development days.  Grade Level data is reviewed on a regular basis to trigger staff 
development plans for professional development days. Differentiated instruction targeted to student need is 
implemented school wide on 
a daily basis in both designated times and integrated throughout the day. The district 
provides three Professional Development days for our site to focus on professional growth in areas of student 
achievement. Second language acquisition continues to be a 
focus, as well as ELD, literacy, math and writing.  Substitutes 
are provided for teachers to have access to district instructional coaches for continued support and content area expertise. 
Site teachers also participate in lesson study days and district pr
ofessional development days, as well as conferences 
during the school year or summer. Teachers collaborate via grade level meetings, often during their prep time, and other 
created opportunities during admin to student assemblies and presentations. The pro
fessional development Lucas 
participate in is aligned to the district's strategic plan, as well as specific site needs.
