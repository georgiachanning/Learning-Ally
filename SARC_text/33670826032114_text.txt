About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law 
to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to 
prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
con
sistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
A District committee considers textbooks for recommendation on a cycle established by the State Board of Education and from a
 
State adopted list.  The 
committee meets to discuss cu
rrent issues relevant to the subject matter, including student success, previously used textbooks, and instructional 
methods.  The committee reviews demonstration copies of proposed textbooks, as well as listen to representatives describe the
 
various highl
ights of the 
available materials.  The review is followed by a pilot of materials that results in consensus by the committee of a recommen
ded textbook.  The textbook 
is forwarded to a K
-
12 Curriculum Council, which consists of teachers, parents, and commun
ity stakeholders, for review and approval.  If the textbook is 
approved by the K
-
12 Curriculum Council, the textbook is forwarded to the Superintendent and the Governing Board for their review and approval.
  
Each 
pupil in the district, including English le
arners, kindergarten through grade twelve, is provided with standards
-
aligned textbooks or basic instructional 
materials that are consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framework adopted by the State Board.
 
 
AB 1246, added Education Code 
Section 60210, which allows the district to use any instructional materials, not just state
-
adopted, as long as they are 
aligned with the academic content standards.  The EC 60119 has a new section (e) with a reference to the Common Core State St
andards (C
CSS).  The 

content standards, it is the 
intent of the Legislature that textbooks, instructional materials, and supplemental instruc
tional materials be deemed to be aligned with the content 
standards pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (c), and be deemed consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framew
ork adopted by the state 
board pursuant to subdivision (a) if the textboo
ks, instructional materials, supplemental instructional materials, or a combination of any such materials 

ed to either the 1997 
sta
ndards or the 2010 CCSS standards for mathematics and English Language Arts are compliant with Williams Act requirements.  In
 
accordance with 
Education Code Section 60422(a) and 60119, the Governing Board certified on 9/3/2019 that each pupil in the distri
ct, including English learners, in 
kindergarten through grade twelve, has been provided with standards
-
aligned textbooks or basic instructional materials in each of the areas listed below:

on and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

however, the number of students tested is not
