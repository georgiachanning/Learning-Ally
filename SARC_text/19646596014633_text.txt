By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Situated in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, La Ca
ñada Elementary (LCE) is proud to be one of the four schools 
that comprise La Cañada Unified School District (LCUSD), identified in 2012 by the U.S. Department of Education as the 
top performing K
-
12 school district in California. Honored in 2010 and 2014 


problems, express themselves articulately in speaking, writing, and technology, and to work co
operatively and individually 

consistent high performing status. Thanks to the generous and ongoing support of the community, the school campus
 
is 
beautifully landscaped and well maintained. The facility is made available to the community for a variety of activities, 
including sports, scouts, campus childcare, and enrichment classes.
 
 
At LCE, there is a school climate that promotes communication 
and collaboration. The staff is committed to knowing 
students from the time they enter transitional kindergarten or kindergarten to the time they promote to seventh grade. 
Teachers do their utmost to stay connected with children, appreciating them as indiv
iduals; they mentor students, create 
special bonds through small group lunches, and use older students to tutor younger ones. As an integral source of guidance 

h individual counseling, 
small groups, and classroom lessons. The staff has developed and implemented a core, standards
-
based curriculum that 
integrates differentiated instruction, often project
-
oriented, and designed to engage and to motivate all students
 
to reach 
their highest potential. Supplemented by a well
-
rounded education that includes music, art, drama, Spanish, physical 
education, and technology, the comprehensive program values the whole child. Teachers draw from a wide array of 
instructional str
ategies, resources, and materials. They monitor and update pacing guides to keep curriculum relevant and 
rigorous. Through analyzing data, teachers establish clear, measurable, and attainable goals for each student. Students 
who are struggling receive addi
tional support through a tiered process of intervention programs, including reading 
intervention and online intervention support. The process also includes efforts of teachers to accommodate individual 
learning needs and Student Study Teams, which seek ans
wers and develop strategies that can be used at home. By using 
such resources, the struggling students, as well as those in Special Education and English Language Development, make 
significant academic growth. The overall goal is to ensure that every child
 
experiences success. The core belief at LCE is 
that all students can achieve, and they are motivated to believe this, as well.

LCE has 
implemented multiple strategies to engage school families and the community in support of student success and 
school improvement. The Parent Teacher Association (PTA), which boasts nearly 100% membership, is dedicated to 
student success by focusing on stud
ent enrichment and learning. World Fair Days are an annual signature program at 
which parents and volunteers staff booths representing cultures from around the world. The PTA funds school
-
wide 
assemblies on topics spanning from character education to physi
cal fitness to the arts. There are opportunities for parent 
participation through our Science and Art Docent programs. Parent involvement is a key component to classroom support 
in the primary grade classrooms, and every class has an active team of room pa
rents, another PTA program. Parents also 
participate in welcoming new families by hosting a social gathering to foster connections and to provide informational 

 
has expanded to include 

Halloween Haunt, by hosting a very popular Korean BBQ booth.
 
 
In the community, LCE partners with Kiwanis to recogni
ze outstanding student citizenship through the Terrific Kids 
program and provide scholarships for field trips such as the 5th grade trip to Valley Forge. Partnering with the Sheriff 
Department brings the STAR anti
-
drug program into the classroom. Parents h

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The school has a safety plan designed to prepare students and employees, as well as parents, to respond appropriately in 
case of disaster. The safety plan includes identification of appropriate strategies to maintain a high level of
 
security and 
procedures for compliance with existing school safety laws. An assessment of the status of any school
-
related crime is also 
included. Fire/lockdown drills are held each month to ensure that students and staff will respond safely in the event 
of an 
emergency. Disaster drills, such as earthquake drills, are held at least one time a year to ensure that there is appropriate 
response to a natural catastrophe. The frequency of lockdown drills has increased in response to recent tragedies in 
schools 
across America and abroad. The LCAP Council reviews and approves the Safety Plan each Fall.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
Through the support of the district administration and the cooperation and efforts of the special education and general 
education staff, children with exceptional and special needs are receiving 
appropriate educational services. All students 
with special needs are placed into an appropriate educational setting and receive special support either directly in the 
general education classroom or in a special education classroom.  Students qualifying fo
r special education services have 
their Individual Education Programs (IEP) monitored by IEP Teams comprised of the school psychologist, a special 
education staff member, the child's classroom teacher, parents and an administrator or designee. Parents of s
pecial 
education students are encouraged to participate fully in developing their child's individual educational plan.
 
 
Gifted and talented students are identified yearly in grades three and above. Programs for GATE students include pull
-
out 
weekly instruc
tion and after school enrichment. Emphasis has been placed in areas of mathematics, science and critical 
thinking skills at the elementary sites.
 
 
The home language survey is used to determine the primary language for each student in the district. Students
 
with a 
language other than English are assessed to determine their English language proficiency. If appropriate, students are 
provided instruction in English language development. Students with the greatest need also receive additional ELD support 
in the 
regular classroom and in small group settings.  The district and school staff monitor students' ELD progress through 
the school year.
 
 
Through funding from the PTA and District, a Reading Intervention Program is provided to elementary students who are 
in n
eed of additional support in the area of reading. The program begins in September of each school year and ends in 
April. Students participate in the program before or after the school day. Phonics and comprehension skills are the target 
areas for instructi
on.
 
 
La Cañada Unified School District is fortunate to have active parents and community who contribute generously to the 
schools. The Education Foundation has contributed over $2,000,000 annually to the district in the last three years. These 
funds are us
ed to reduce class size, contribute to full
-
time counseling services, fund the district librarian and provide art, 
drama, and music instruction to all students in grades TK 
-
 
6 and optional Spanish classes in grades 3 
-
 
6. These funds also 
contribute to di
strict
-
wide technology and after school enrichment programs.

During the past three years the primary areas of focus 
for staff development at LCUSD have been the implementation of 
Common Core State Standards (CCSS) in Math and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and training for special 
education teachers through the SELPA. Special Education staff attend 2
-
3 days of
 
staff development during the year 
sponsored by the Foothill SELPA.  We have also paired experienced teachers with teachers who are new to the LCUSD for 
mentoring and instructional support.  The annual number of days have varied from 4
-
10 days depending on
 
teacher needs. 
Newer teachers require more days of professional development to obtain knowledge and skills necessary to implement 
the new standards and the strategies that prepare students for college and career. Additionally, all teachers have been 
provi
ded with the opportunity to attend trainings/conferences outside of the district.
 
 
The District has continued to work with organizations called, Teachers Development Group, to provide support to the site 
administration with evaluation and monitoring of the
 
implementation of the new strategies. The District has also been 
working with the K
-
12 Alliance at WestEd to provide NGSS training to teachers and administrators.  Due to ELA adoption 
in grades K
-
6, trainings have been provided to the teachers in those gr
ade levels by the publisher to ensure smooth and 
effective implementation of the new textbooks/materials. Teachers have been piloting NGSS aligned materials and have 
been trained by the publishers to appropriately use the materials during the piloting peri
od.
 
 
Eleven half days in grades 1
-
6 and five full days in kindergarten have been provided to teachers for collaboration 
throughout the year. This time has been used to share best practices, design CCSS aligned lessons and projects, create 
common assessment
s, etc.
 
 
Training sessions have been provided within the district by Technology Integrationists in the areas of instructional 
technology, new assessments, CCSS aligned report cards and digital citizenship. Grade level and team leaders in extra
-
duty extra
-
p
ay positions also provide support to all teachers. Online workshops and trainings have additionally been 
provided to certificated and classified staff through Kennan and Associates and Alliance of Schools for Cooperative 
Insurance Programs (ASCIP).

Above 
and beyond regular trainings provided to all teachers, specialized training has been provided to Special Education 
teachers to address the specific needs of students in Special Education. Several Crisis Prevention and Intervention 
workshops have been provi
ded throughout the past three years to allow the teachers and paraprofessionals to work 
effectively with students with severe emotional and social needs. Teachers and paraprofessionals successfully completing 
the training are certified for two years. Speci
al Education teachers and service providers have received training on 
developing Individualized Educational Programs (IEPs) that provide educational benefit for students.
 
 
The Peer Assistance and Review Program as well as the Teacher Assistance Mentor Prog
ram have provided mentors for 
teachers who needed support in specific areas based on evaluations. Principals and colleagues have provided support 
through staff meetings, teacher
-
principal meetings, peer observations, classroom walkthrough feedback and mode
ling of 
CCSS aligned lessons by teacher leaders and Technology Integrationists.
 
 
LCUSD administrative team is granted a stipend for professional growth activities and has benefited from the opportunity 
to enroll in advanced level college courses and Associ
ation of California School Administrators (ACSA) academies. The 
District has provided sexual harassment training for all management level positions and held monthly leadership team 

onal development.
