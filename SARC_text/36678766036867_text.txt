By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

State adopted list of materials. Transitional Kindergarten mater

These materials are standards
-
based and are rigorously reviewed by San Bernardino City Unified School District textbook 
adoption committees to assure that selections will meet the unique needs of all
 
learners, including English language 
learners, advanced learners, at
-
risk students and special needs students.  Textbooks are usually adopted for an eight
-
year 
cycle.
 
 
All core curriculum materials are available in English and Spanish.  The Board of Educa
tion ensures that standards
-
aligned 
textbooks and/or instructional materials are purchased for each student to use in class and at home. Instructional 
materials include a variation of textbooks and/or consumables, big books and supplemental materials deter
mined by the 
district to cover required state standards. English Language Development (ELD) materials are standards
-
aligned and are 
purchased for each student who is identified as an English learner.  An inventory is completed for each classroom at every 
s
chool site and is reported to the District Office to ensure that sufficient materials are available for the new school year. 
 
This inventory is completed in March/April of each year to prepare for the following school year.
 
 
The district is phasing in a ne
w science adoption, the previously adopted, state framework aligned, textbooks will remain 
in use until the new adopted books are implemented at district schools. The new Science adoption is beginning in 2019 
and will be in use August of 2020.
 
 
In addition
 


program is voluntary and
 
open to students in grades four through six.  Sufficient instructional materials are available for 
all students electing to participate in this music program.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides 
the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for 
students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the admini
stration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successf
ully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Each school provides multiple 
options for parents to participate in the educational process.  Parents are key stakeholders 
in the lives of our Del Rosa scholars. Parents are asked to participate in our three parent groups. School Site Council, 
English Language Advisory and the African 
American Parent Advisory Committee. There are also monthly parent 
workshops that include topics that are selected by parent interest. We encourage parents to be involved as volunteers in 
the school and/or chaperones on field trips. For more information on 
how to support the scholars of Del Rosa please 
contact Ms. Susie Villa.
 
 
 
At the district level, parents can participate in the District Advisory Committee (DAC), District English Learners Advisory 
Committee (DELAC), District African American Advisory Coun
cil (DAAAC), and a variety of short
-
term, solution
-
oriented 
focus groups and advisory committees.  Additionally, a Family Resource Center is available from the hours of 8:00 AM 
-
4:30 PM.  Goals of the Family Resource Center include increased home/school co
mmunication, increased access to district
-
level parent and family training opportunities, and increased access to family involvement resources for district schools.

Date Last Reviewed with Faculty:  Sept. 9, 2019
 
 
Every 
student and teacher has the right to attend a school free from physical and psychological harm. To help schools 
achieve these vital goals, the State of California has mandated that each K
-
12 school develop a comprehensive school 
safety plan.  Reviewed annu

local public safety agencies, community leaders, parents, pupils, teachers, administrators, and other persons interested 
in the prevention of campus crime and v

preparedness, mitigation and prevention, response and recovery.
 
 
In close cooperation with the California Schools Risk Management (Joint
-
Powers Authority), local police and fire 
depart

sites and provides correction reports to site administrators.  A follow
-
up system is in place to ensure timely compliance 
and correction of dis
crepancies.
 
 
School sites also conduct scheduled drills for anticipated emergency situations (such as fires, earthquakes and lockdowns) 
to prepare students, staff, and other stakeholders how to appropriately respond to those emergencies. The district
 
follows 

System (NIMS) for emergency management.  The Office of Safety and Emergency Management is also tasked with 
coordinating the response and rec
overy of emergencies or other disasters affecting the SBCUSD.

The California Department 
of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1, 2018, regarding how to calculate school

pupil expenditures that will be 
reported on 2018

19 report cards.
 
 
Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
The common goal of all categorically 
funded programs in the San Bernardino City Unified School District (SBCUSD) is to 
ensure that all students
--
including English learners, educationally disadvantaged pupils, African American, Hispanic English 
only, gifted and talented pupils, and pupils with
 
exceptional needs
--
attain mastery of state and local standards.
 
 
The educational program at each site is based on an improvement planning process that includes members of the school 
community such as the principal, teachers, support staff, parents, and st
udents (at the secondary level). These 
stakeholders form the School Site Council (SSC). The SSC develops and annually monitors, evaluates and revises a plan 
called the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA). The SPSA, based on self
-
study and collaborat
ion, ensures that all 
of the resources available to the school are coordinated and focused on providing a high
-
quality educational program in 
which all students can achieve success.
 
 
Some students have difficulty mastering academic state and local content 
standards. They may be at risk of not meeting 
graduation requirements. For these students, categorical program funds are provided. Categorical funds are supplemental 
educational dollars used for supports that augment the core instructional program and incr
ease the academic success of 
these students. Categorical funds provide items such as additional personnel time, staff development opportunities, 
supplemental student materials, and other specialized services, equipment, and supplies.
 
 
Categorical programs 
commonly found at SBCUSD sites are:
 

 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Title I, Part A
 

 
Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF)
 
 
Additionally, categorical programs have been established at the district level to provide important services and 
instructional suppo
rt that help increase student success. Categorical funds in this category support District efforts in the 
areas of:
 

 
Vocational Education Basic Grant Award (Voc Ed) 

 
Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement 
Act of 2006
 

 
ESSA Title II, Part
 
A 

 
Supporting Effective Instruction
 

 
ESSA Title III, Part A 

 
Language Instruction for English Learners (EL) and Language Instruction for Immigrant 
Students
 
 
Continuous Improvement
 
LEAs are encouraged to use evidence
-
based interventions that are reasonabl
e, necessary, and consistent with Title I, Part 
A of the ESSA, to improve student achievement for those students not meeting grade level standards. At the local level, 
SBCUSD identifies schools with greatest needs, based on a variety of data, including loc
al and state student progress 
indicators, to provide additional resources and services to the schools (referred to as Targeted Support for School Progress 
or TSSP). Additionally, the California Dashboard is used to identify schools and student groups in ne
ed of Comprehensive 
Support and Improvement (CSI), Targeted Support and Improvement (TSI), and Additional Targeted Support and 
Improvement (ATSI).
