About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

At Silver Wing, we agree with research that has proven that the most effective schools in the United States are schools that 
have 
a high degree of 
family/parent and community involvement in their school programs. We encourage parents to visit Silver Wing often and to beco
me active in our school 
program.  Silver Wing Elementary School involves parents in various ways, such as the Scho
ol Site Council (SSC), and an English Learner Advisory 
Committee (ELAC), and the Parent Teacher Organization (PTO).  The parent and community members of these organizations partici
pate in many projects 
and programs that benefit the students, staff and fami
lies of the Silver Wing community. Parents are also encouraged to participate and be informed 

 
parent curriculum nights.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Student safety and well being are prom
oted by activities including fire, emergency/disaster, earthquake, and evacuation drills, which are conducted on 
a monthly basis. Playground safety is promoted by ongoing supervision by the principal, classroom teachers, noon duty assista
nts, and custodial
 
staff. 
Parent workshops focusing on parenting skills for effective child
-
rearing practices, parent
-
child engagement, and family involvement to promote student 
safety are provided when requested by parents. Silver Wing has focused on a tiered approach to b
ehavior and academics through Multi Tiered Systems 
of Support. Silver Wing has established a Positive Behavior Intervention and Support program, where a responsible, respectful
 
and safe environment is 
fostered and encouraged through a variety of programs. 
Data is taken on when and where behaviors are occurring that need to be addressed.
 
 
The School Site Council approved the School Safety Plan in October, 2019.
