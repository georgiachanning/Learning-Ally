About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
dist
rict office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 

re classrooms and campus grounds are well
-
maintained and kept 
safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) employs an electronic work order sys
tem enabling school staff 
to communicate unscheduled maintenance need
s, urgent repairs, or special projects. Most of the school's repairs and maintenance projects are 

ither by the school custodian 
or 
district maintenance staff, based upon the nature of the situation. Day and evening custodians work closely as a team and wit
h the principal for routine 
maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events preparations. The principal and day custodian c
ommunicate daily to discuss campus cleaning 
needs and safety concerns. Every morning before school begins, the custodian and principal inspect facilities for safety haza
rds, graffiti, and other 
conditions that require removal prior to students and staff en


 
procedures, use of 
chemicals, and us
e of equipment. The day custodians are responsible for following an established set of cleaning standards and prioritization 
procedures 
for general campus maintenance. The day custodian checks restrooms twice a day as a proactive measure in keeping facilit
ies well stocked, safe, and 
sanitary. The evening custodians are responsible for thorough cleaning of classrooms, office areas, and restrooms. Groundskee
pers are dispatched by 
the district office to perform general maintenance of landscaping, gardening, sp
orts fields, and irrigation systems.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

All curriculum and instructional improvement activities at Santa Ana Unified School District are aligned to the Common Core S
tate Standards. Staff 
development concentrations are 
selected and identified based upon student assessment results, Federal and State requirements, teacher input, state 
content standards, and professional development surveys. All staff development activities at Santa Ana Unified School Distric
t are focused o
n increasing 
student learning and proficiency. Santa Ana Unified School District offers supplemental training and support for new and ongo
ing program 
implementation. Training activities take place throughout the school year, after school, and during the su
mmer and generally focus on curriculum, 
teaching strategies, and methodologies.
 
 
 
New teachers and teachers not yet fully credentialed are supported by peer coaching and extensive staff development. The TIPS
 
Induction Program 
(Teacher Induction and Profess
ional Support) is a state
-
approved program that offers additional support and assistance to newly credentialed teachers. 
All new teachers are assigned to a Support Provider (mentor teacher) and provided individualized support over a two
-
year period. More i
nformation 
about the TIPS Induction Program is available on the SAUSD website.
 
 
To support veteran teachers as well as new teachers to the district, Santa Ana Unified School District offers Peer Assistance
 
and Review (PAR) which is 
easily defined as teache
rs helping teachers. Experienced and knowledgeable veteran teachers, referred to as Consulting Teachers, provide ongoing 
assistance to teachers who need to improve their instructional skills, classroom management strategies, subject knowledge, an
d/or relat
ed aspects of 
their teaching performance.
 
 
Staff members are encouraged to attend professional workshops and conferences. New teachers, experienced teachers, mentor/ te
acher leaders, 
administrators, and support staff are encouraged to participate in worksh
ops sponsored by the Orange County Office of Education and courses offered 
by community colleges and universities. Classified support staff may receive additional job
-
related training from vendors, department supervisors, and 
district representatives.
