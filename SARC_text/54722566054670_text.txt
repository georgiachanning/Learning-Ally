Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions 
and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Royal Oaks Elementary School takes great efforts to ensure a safe, clean, and functional physical environment for students, 
staff, and volunteers. Sufficient space is provided for students and staff to support 
teaching and learning, including 
sufficient classrooms, playgrounds, and staff work rooms. To assist our school in this effort, the district uses a facility 
survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The re
sults of this survey are 
available at the district office. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by 
speaking with the school principal.

MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR
 
District maintenance staff ensure that the repai
rs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.
 
No other emergency facilities needs exis
t at this school.
 
 
CLEANING PROCESS AND SCHEDULE
 
In addition to custodial staff on duty during the school day, a team of maintenance specialists come in after hours for daily
 
cleaning. District and school maintenance staff work cooperatively with administr
ators to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROGRAM
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a 
dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis to assist scho
ol districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school 
building components.  Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or 
exterior painting, and floor systems. The deferre
d maintenance program ensures that all classrooms and facilities are 
maintained to a degree of adequacy that allows for a good learning environment.
 
 
FACILITIES IMPROVEMENTS
 
Continued improvements are made to the campus, as deemed necessary.
 
 
In Summer of 
2018, Royal Oaks went through an extensive modernization of two classroom wings and the school library.  
These two buildings were brought to ADA compliance, in addition to modernizing the technology in the classrooms.  These 
two buildings, along with all t
he classrooms on our campus were equipped with 2
-
3 television monitors for instructional 
displays.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California
 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [
ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State St
andards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univer
sity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number

Parent involvement and 
communication are essential to our school success. Royal Oaks Elementary School continually 
strives to involve parents by sharing information that helps parents understand and support school programs and by 
providing opportunities for parent participation 
in school activities.
 
 
There are numerous and varied opportunities for parent involvement, including but not limited to, attending school 
functions (e.g., Back

to
-
School Night, Annual Fall Carnival, Student Recognition assemblies, PTA family nights, Open 
H
ouse), volunteering in classrooms, chaperoning field trips, and participating in parent
-
teacher conferences. Parents may 
also serve on advisory committees and leadership teams, including, but not limited to, the English Learners Advisory 
Committee (ELAC), 
School Site Council (SSC), PBIS, and the Parent Teacher Association (PTA). Additional opportunities for 
parental involvement also exist at the district level (e.g., DAC, DELAC).
 
 
To promote open and regular communication with parents, Royal Oaks sends out 
sends out frequent parent notes and 
sends frequent phone messages through our Blackboard Connect electronic messaging system. We also maintain a 
calendar of events on our school website. In addition, the school works closely with the PTA to promote messagi

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Royal Oaks Elementary School. Campus
-
wide supervision ensures 
students are safe on school grounds before, 
during, and after school. Entrances to school grounds are secured and 
monitored during the school day. All visitors must sign in at the office and wear appropriate identification while on 
campus.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is designed to assist 
in maintaining a safe school environment and preparing for 
emergencies. The plan requires identification of security needs, development of prevention and intervention techniques, 
evaluation of physical facilities, and communication with staff and students.
 
The safety plan is reviewed annually, updated 
as needed, shared with staff each Fall (October 2019), and fully compliant with federal and state regulations. In addition, 
the School Site Council (SSC) reviews and approves the plan annually. This was comple
ted in October 2019. An updated 
copy is available to the public at the school office and is on the VUSD website.
 
 

preparedness drills 
are conducted regularly and the school staff is appropriately trained.

focus for the school year.  This year we have focused on Interactive Read Aloud, utilizing the 
Fountas and Pinnell program.  
Teachers have received focused training by our district TOSAs.  Continuous professional development in ELA, technology, 
classroom management has also been offered to teachers.  Every teacher on site has taken at least one oppo
rtunity to 
attend a Professional Development of their choice.  The Leadership Team at Royal Oaks continues to meet monthly to set 
AIM statements that are developed in conjunction with our entire certificated staff and SSC.  The follow
