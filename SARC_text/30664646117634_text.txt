By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our mission is clear and vital: to help all children lea
rn, to learn more tomorrow than they learn today, and to learn more 
next year than they learn this year. The staff at Don Juan Avila Elementary School (DJAES), in partnership with the home, 
will assist students to become contributing members of society, em
powered with the skills and knowledge necessary to 
excel in an ever
-
changing world. The Education Team is dedicated to providing high 21st Century Common Core standards 
where students are challenged and excel beyond expectations. Teachers work to instill t
he enjoyment of lifelong learning 
in a safe and nurturing environment. The school community is a diverse representation of multi
-
socioeconomic levels and 
ethnicities, with neighborhoods from the City of Aliso Viejo including single
-
family dwellings, condom
iniums, and 
apartments. Diversity brings a host of unique cultural enrichment opportunities to students thanks to the many wonderful 
languages spoken by the students and community residents.
 
 
The setting of high standards and expectations for all students 
is the key to success.  Don Juan Avila Elementary School 
(DJAES) offers a complete and comprehensive educational program to nearly 800 Transitional Kindergarteners through 
fifth grade students. Staff recognizes the importance of student acquisition of not 
only basic skills but the ability to use 
those skills in all subject areas, including language arts, math, science, social studies, and the arts. Special emphasis is 
placed on reading, writing, mathematics, critical thinking, social skills, technology, and
 
problem solving because, 

Distinguished School Award for the third time!
 
 

t of our school community as well as other community 
affiliations. The PTA raises over $100,000 annually in support of students, staff and parents. PTA provides programs such 
as Scholastic Reading Counts, a library technician, science lab, science teacher,
 
field trips, art, music, assemblies, classroom 
supply allocations, garden experiences, lunch time activities, technology instructional programs and so much more. DJAES 
works in partnership with our parents, community, and local businesses.  This takes the
 
form of continual school

home 
communication via weekly emails sent via through School Messenger, automated voicemails, the DJAES website, parent 
volunteers, community volunteers, an on
-
campus YMCA for before and after
-
school childcare, plus the active see
king of 
donations and business partnerships. Parent volunteers are a critical component of our instructional program.  Peer 
Assistance Leadership (PAL) students from the adjoining middle school assist students and teachers in classrooms.  In 
essence, DJAES
 
builds a strong sense of community 

 
a place where everyone comes together to promote teaching, 

family at DJAES.  Staff strives to 
know every child and family by name and by need.
 
 
Every year, the Student Council and PTA collaborate to focus on programs that encourage students to give back to the 
community, such as collecting food for Saddleback Outreach, donating pajamas and books to
 
needy children, and school 

tribute to our local Veterans is a school wide event.
 
 

Everyone Achieves More!" This simple, yet powerful, statement is a 
testament to our collaboration and work as a PLC, as well as the interactive teaching and learning that takes place in our 
classrooms.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP
] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eigh
t and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant c
ognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or progra
ms 
of study.

Capistrano Unified School District places great value on the role of professional learning, and utilizes systems
-
wide 
structures and strategies to promote continuous learning of adults that result in increased learning for students.  The 
ongoing focus for professional learning is to support the district's Wildly Important Goal for Teaching and Learning.  It is 
the distric
t goal to engage students in meaningful, challenging, and innovative educational experiences to increase post
-
secondary options for all students.
 
 
It is the goal of  Capistrano Unified School District to ensure all students receive Great First Instruction 
(GFI).  The vision 
for GFI is that all learning environments include Lesson Preparation, Interaction, Strategies, and Review and Assessment 
as defined by the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP).  By design, the model for providing professiona
l 
learning is multi
-
tiered, and ranges from large
-
scale, district
-
wide learning opportunities focused on priority areas to site
-
specific, embedded professional learning (including coaching) that supports teachers in the transfer of that learning to the 
cla

school hours to further support district initiatives and teacher needs for ongoing professional learning. The outcome of all 
CUSD professional 
learning is to improve educator effectiveness in order to increase student learning. In support of this 
outcome, administrators participate in professional learning to increase their knowledge of quality practices, California 
Content Standards, and strateg
ies for instructional leadership.
 
 
Since 2004, all schools provide specific release time for embedded professional learning using late start or early release 
days.  In grades K
-
8, this time is known as ACE time (Articulation and Collaboration for Excellenc
e).  The purpose of this 
time is for educators to examine the impact of their practice on student learning, with a focus on continuous improvement.  
Schools work to identify key areas of learning based on an analysis of student data, upon which they place 
their focus for 
professional learning and set annual measurable goals based upon those identified areas of need. These areas are 
determined through the analysis of student learning data from multiple sources, including, but not limited to high stakes 
testi
ng. The action plan developed to accomplish these goals outlines priorities for teacher training and implementation.
 
 
Throughout the year, the structure of collaboration typically involves teacher teams engaging in ongoing examination of 
standards
-
based cu
rriculum, the examination of meaningful formative and summative assessment data, and powerful 
teaching strategies that get results in student learning. In 2017 the District developed the CUSD Professional Learning 

ment for professional collaboration.  All collaborative teams utilize Common 
Goals, Relational Trust, Focus on Learning, Shared Responsibility, Action
-
Oriented, Data Driven, and Systems and 
Structures for Support  to ensure all students are learning at hig
h levels.  These embedded professional learning activities 
help prepare teams to provide a differentiated instructional program that meets the needs of all students.
 
 
Beginning teachers receive systematic training and support during their first two years o
f teaching within the CUSD 
Induction Program. This program assists new teachers as they build upon the skills they already possess upon entering the 
field of teaching, and provides them with support from a veteran teacher. The program is approved by the Ca
lifornia State 

to those activities previously described, all teachers may receive support, assistance, and opportunities to grow 
professio
nally through their participation in school site learning teams, student study teams, from district resource 
teachers, and the Peer Assistance and Review Program.
