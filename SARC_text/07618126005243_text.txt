Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or
 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
pr
incipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which 
data were collected:
 
September 23, 2019
 
 
The state of California requires that each child have a current standards
-
based textbook in each of the four core areas of 
instruction. As a part of this requirement, Walnut Creek School District has purchased editi
ons for teaching language arts 
(reading, writing, speaking and listening), science, social science, mathematics and health. We are fortunate to have a 
music text (K
-
5) for our students and a music specialist who meets with all of the classes. Our foreign
-
l
anguage texts are 
also up
-
to
-
date. Thus, all textbooks in the Walnut Creek School District are current, standards
-
based, and consistent with 
the content and cycles of the Curriculum Frameworks and adopted and approved by the State Board of Education.
 
 
We h
ave an abundance of supplementary reading materials at varying levels of difficulty in each of our elementary 
classrooms that are integrated across all core curricular areas. These leveled reading materials provide students with 
experiences in reading narr
ative as well as expository text.
 
 
The Walnut Creek School District governing board held a public hearing on September 23, 2019 and affirmed that each 
pupil, including English learners, has his or her own textbook to use in class and to take home.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achi
evement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entranc
e to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Walnut Heights recognizes the 
importance of the partnership between home and school and is committed to supporting 
parents as partners. Parents are active members of our school community supporting the school improvement process 
and serving in a number of capacities including the libra
ry, PTA and the Walnut Creek Education Foundation. Parent 
volunteers support classroom events and activities and community events. Parents often support our specialist
-
taught 
classes of art and science.
 
 
During the course of the year, parents have many opp
ortunities to get involved. We have a very active Parent Teacher 
Association (PTA). They sponsor many programs that bring parents to school. For example, on a yearly basis this 
organization sponsors back to school activities, book fairs, a fall carnival an
d other activities. Our Educational Foundation 
was formed to help our district fundraise for programs that support equity across the district and benefit all students.

We hold monthly drills and review safety procedures with students and staff on a regular basis. The plan is updated and 
Governing Board approved on an annual basis. The plan includes school

wide 
emergency responses to fire, earthquake, 
chemical spills and other disasters. In addition, it details plans for setting up a temporary shelter, an evacuation center o

all personnel. Parents receive 
regular information and reminders about our emergency procedures in the weekly Walnut Heights eNews. The school 
Leadership Team meets regularly, adding safety to the agenda as needed throughout the year to work on specific

mprovements to playground supervision and campus safety issues as they arise.  The School Safety Plan was reviewed by 
staff in August 2019.
