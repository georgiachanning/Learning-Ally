By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We conduct monthly emergency drills and maintain emergency supplies, including food and water. Every year the school 
also conducts an emergency drill in which the Pacifica police and fire 
departments often participate. Because the district 
is located along a major fault line, the drills have focused on safety procedures during and following an earthquake. Drills 
include evacuating the building, practicing securing the campus, and establishi
ng communication protocols. After each 
drill, the school evaluates and revises emergency guidelines accordingly. The school grounds are monitored informally by 
all staff.  All visitors must sign in at the front desk in the main office before coming on camp
us, wear a visitor's badge, and 
sign out when they leave. We lock the perimeter of the school after drop off so that there is only one main entry point at 
the front of the school during school hours.  As an added precaution, we also encourage teachers to k
eep their exterior 
doors locked during the school day. We revise our School Safety Plan in September of every school year, and it is available 
for review at the school and on the school website. There also is an emergency plan, with action items for all st
aff clearly 
outlined.  We follow the BIG Five emergency procedures outlined by San Mateo County.

staff training, both on and off

campus, to 
learn about and implement the best practices in all subject areas. Whenever the 
district adopts new materials, our teachers receive training from experts sent from the publisher as well as the district. 
We have also received professional development on str
ategies for creating and maintaining a positive school climate 
through our PBIS and SEL trainings.
