By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The 2018
-
19 school year marks the first year of operation for Táawila Elementary School (TES).
  
The name Táawila was 
taken from the language of the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians, who have inhabited the Menifee Valley and adjacent 
areas of Riverside County for thousands of years. In fact, the rocky hill that towers above the site of the school is
 
considered 
sacred land by local Native Americans.  Táawila (TAH
-
we
-
la) in the Native American language, translates to "gathering or 
sitting place."  Back in time, the hills surrounding Audie Murphy Ranch were once a sacred gathering place for members 
of t
he Pechanga tribe and now Táawila Elementary School will be a gathering place for our students, their families, staff 
and the local community.

In collaboration with our parent
s and educational partners we are committed to academic excellence built upon a 
foundation of equality and personal responsibility. Táawila Elementary School serves approximately 300 students in 
grades Kindergarten through 5th grade. At TES students learn 
to work together, respect each other and are able to 
collaborate and contribute as member of any group while maintaining their individuality. As a school, we reach out and 
work in unison with our school and community partners, such as ELAC (English Languag
e Advisory Committee), SSC (School 
Site Council), and Booster Club to support all students. Our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement was written and aligned 
with the District LCAP goals: 1.TES will recruit, hire and retain highly qualified staff, and provid
e ongoing professional 
development in order to support optimum learning opportunities for student success. 2. TES will effectively maximize 
learning for all students, staff, and parents in order to prepare students for college and career in the 21st centur
y. 3. TES 
will engage and involve parents and community in the educational process of our students and by doing so, will increase 
the level of trust within the community. Parents and community members volunteer regularly in classrooms, the library 
and the 
front office. Our school webpage, notices home, email, the Parent/Student Handbook and communication apps 
are used to share our work and resources with parents and the community. We encourage involvement through Booster 
Club and advisory committees at the 
site and District level. Parents who have questions about getting involved at TES can 
contact our office (951)723

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Each Menifee Union School site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP), including a disaster preparedness 
plan annually. A copy of the TES Comprehensive School Safety Plan is available for review at the school office. The plan 
includes emergenc
y procedures for natural disasters and campus intruders. Students, teachers, and staff are trained to 
prepare for a wide range of emergencies, and frequent drills help to refine emergency skills, policies, and procedures at 
all school sites. Also, followin
g each drill, specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to improve 
emergency procedures continually, and therefore enhance campus safety.
 
 
TES staff exercises strict adherence to the district adopted safety/site security protocols, 
which include a leveled/colored 

-
in using our Raptor 
system. TES Comprehensive Safety Plan is reviewed annually; the entire staff participates in monthly eme
rgency drills and 
provides feedback.
 
 
Finally, school and district administrators immediately investigate threats of harm. Teachers and administrators seek to 
foster lines of open communication, so students and parents feel comfortable reporting inappropri
ate activity, including 
bullying, harassment, or threats. All TES staff take a strong stand against threatening behavior or bullying and investigate 
complaint matters thoroughly.
 
 
Our Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) system teaches and
 
reinforces appropriate student behaviors. 
We foster social
-
emotional learning (SEL) skills development in the form of weekly lessons delivered school
-
wide to all 
students, supported by curriculum from SecondStep.org. The curriculum establishes high expect
ations for achievement 
by all students in every subject area, and students are supported by counseling services that include crisis counseling, peer
 
counseling, and intervention programs.

As a school district, we are focused on increasing academic achievement in English Language Arts and Mathematics along 
with increasing school attendance.   To this end, our professional 
development strategy is geared to increase student 
engagement through the implementation of our district
-
adopted curriculum and the type of interventions we have in 
place.  Site and district leadership teams review achievement data on state and local asses
sments to make determinations 
on staff development and training, to be aligned with yearly goals and projected activities.
 
 
MUSD provides two full days of professional development along with additional days as needed per site and data.  
Additionally, the m
ajor areas of focus have been on the adopted curriculum and intervention. State and local achievement 
data are used to make determinations. This district provides two full days of professional development along with 
additional days as needed per site and d
ata. Additional days are provided before, during, and after school by either 
directors, coordinators, or intervention specialists. Additionally, conferences, workshops, Grade Level PLC, and staff 
meetings are some ways of providing on
-
going professional gr
owth. Many teachers and administrators continue to take 
college
-
level courses to enhance their teaching or administrative skills.
