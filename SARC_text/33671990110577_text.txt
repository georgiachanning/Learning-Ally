By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Railway was built in 2006.   An additional wing of four
 
classrooms was finished in 2007. More parking spaces were 
completed on the west side of the school. Rubber cushioning has replaced existing wood chips around the climbing play 
structures. A permanent shade structure has been installed over the kindergarte
n playground.   There are 36 total 
classrooms.
 
 
The school is kept clean and attractive. The cafeteria is cleaned daily, and other buildings are vacuumed and/or mopped 
daily. Bathrooms are cleaned daily or more frequently as necessary. Sidewalks and hardsc
ape play areas are cleaned 
weekly. A district gardening crew works at Railway once every eight school days.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by 
the Williams legislation 
of 2004. What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their 
structural integrity, electrical systems, heating and ventilation systems, and more. The important purpose of this 
assessment is to determine if our buildings
 
and grounds are safe and in good repair. If anything needs to be repaired, this 
assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for this assessment 
were written by the Office of Public School Constructi
on (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You 
can look at the six
-
page Facilities Inspection Tool used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our fac
ilities team to inspect them. They used a 

e 
answered the questions you see on this report. Please note that the information reflect
s the condition of our buildings as 
of the date of the report. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Railway prides itself with its partnership with parents. Parents have multiple opportunities to be involved in school 
activities and in their child's education. We have a School Site Council where parents are invited to attend to provide input
 
and perspect
ive reagarding our school programs. Our English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) meets to discuss 
strategies to support our English Learners on reaching English language proficiency. A school site council representative 
and ELAC representative is present
 
at each meeting to bring forth suggestions and ideas from parents. We hold regularly 
scheduled family events in the evening.  Our highly attended Rockin' Read Family Fridays are held a minimum of three 
times a year. During this event, parents attend a wor
kshop relevant to a strategy their child his learning in class. This can 
include PBIS, AVID Strategies, Writing, Math, etc. After the workshop, parents are invited to read with their child in the 
classroom. We have two main family nights. The first is a ST
EM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) Night. Families 
participate in STEM activities with their child. The second is Astronomy/Science Night.
 
 
Parents are encouraged to volunteer in any capacity. This can include supporting in the classroom as a 
volunteer, assisting 
the school with logistical tasks, chaperoning educational study trips, or participating in our FIAT (Family Involvement 
Action Team) Committee. Our FIAT committee meets to collaborate on family events such as Rockin' Read Family Friday

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Staff monitors the school grounds before and after school, at recesses, and at lunchtime. Teachers and staff regularly 
model, teach, and review the expectations for behavior. Railway is a fully fenced, closed campus. Visitors must enter the 
school through 
the main office. All visitors must present a valid I.D. which is scanned into the Raptor System. This system 
improves school safety by verifying that all persons entering campus are authorized to do so. Once the I.D. is scanned it is 
compared to the nation
al registered sex offender databases. Once a visitor is cleared, a badge with the visitor's picture, 
time, destination, and date is printed. This provides awareness among all staff and ensures security throughout campus. 
Additionally, in cases of emergency
, fire or earthquake, the Raptor System generates a report of visitors who were on 
campus.

We revise our School Safety Plan annually. The plan includes procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and inventories of 
emergency supplies. We share the plan with a
ll staff during a school wide staff meeting. We practice fire drills monthly as 
well as earthquake duck and cover and lockdown drills periodically throughout the year. We hold trainings for staff on 
emergency preparedness annually.

Professional Development for staff is centered on school priority and focus areas, using student data to determine overall 
needs. The principal in collaboration with the assistant principal. academic coach and/or leadership team will determine 
the topic an
d goal for professional development. This is delivered through a variety of ways. The most common is through 
a staff meeting. Teachers participate in strategies that can support students with achieving mastery in Math, ELD, and/or 
ELA California Standards.
 
Teachers also attend conferences specific to our school programs in order to enhance teaching 
practices. Our teachers have attended AVID Summer Institute to implement AVID Elementary school
-
wide. Our PE and Art 
teachers also attended a conference specific
 
to their subject. Teachers are supported through individual feedback from 
the principal and/or assistant principal.  Consistent individual support from our academic coach is available to all teachers
 
through a collaborative process. Expectations are model
ed throughout staff meetings and during professional 
development. Teachers are given opportunities to calibrate and a collaborate using data. Follow up support is provided 
by the academic coach to discuss and model best teaching practices and strategies fo
r our students.  Professional 
development focusing on climate and culture (PBIS/MTSS), restorative practices and the PLC model will be provided. New 
teachers are supported through the District's New Teacher Induction Program and meet throughout the year. T
he district 
is also offering professional development throughout the year after school and on Saturdays related to school culture.
