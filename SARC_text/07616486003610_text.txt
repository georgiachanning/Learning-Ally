By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
This school has 32 classrooms, a multi
-
purpose room, a library 
and an administration building.  In addition, there are 3 
portables on the site.  The initial construction was completed in 1947.  Additional construction, which included Wing III, a 
multi
-
purpose room, additional classrooms and a library, were built in ph
ases between 1952 and 1972.  The school opened 
in 1947.
 
 
The District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the LE
A 
uses the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the Office of Publi
c School Construction. The results of this survey are 
available at the school office, at the LEA office, or on the internet at https://www.antiochschools.net/SARC.  Additionally, 
select school site staff have access to iServiceDesk to submit work requests.
  
The Maintenance and Operations Department 
receives the iServiceDesk requests, reviews, and creates work orders in TMA which in turn are assigned to field personnel 
to address the actual issues.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides
 
the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for
 
students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the admin
istration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have success
fully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

20 school year (August 5, 2019, November 1, 
2019, January 6, 2020). As a result, the delivery system changed from prescr
