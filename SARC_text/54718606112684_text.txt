About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Professional learning takes place on an ongoing basis at Golden Valley Elementary.  We are fortunate to have four academic co
aches who are also part
-
time teaching in 2nd and 3rd grades.  Coaches meet regularly to provide informal support as well as formal 
coaching cycles where data is collected, 
analyzed, and planning take place to help support teachers so they may provide high quality instruction to students.  Profess
ional development takes 
place on a monthly bases for 2 hours on selected topics based on n
eeds.  Teachers have one hour of learning new information and then have one hour 
of planning next steps for a total of 8 hours for the year.  We have a strong focus on literacy and our goal is to ensure tha
t 90% of all second graders will 
be reading on gra
de level by the end of the year.
 
Teachers also participate in weekly grade level professional learning communities for 90 mins.  Teachers plan and review lear
ning progressions, review 
upcoming assessments, review assessment data, and plan next steps to imp
rove student achievement.
 
The Admin team meets twice a year with each grade level to discuss goals and student achievement data.  During this meeting 4
 
essential questions are 
discussed. 1. What do we expect our students to learn?  (Goals/Expectations) GIF
