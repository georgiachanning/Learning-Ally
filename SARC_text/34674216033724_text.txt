School Description
 
Bell Avenue School is part of the Robla School District, which consists of 
five elementary schools 
and one preschool program, serving about 2,000 students. The district is located within the City of 
Sacramento, northeast of the central city. The Robla School District was originally established as 
the Oak Grove School District in 
the early 1890s. The district's name was changed to Robla School 
District in 1916. Robla is a derivative of the Spanish word "roble" which means "cluster of British 
Oak trees." During the past school year, Bell Avenue School served 470 students in grades 
k
indergarten through six on a traditional schedule.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educatio
nal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, d
ata reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.g
ov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, 
parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Robla Elementary School District held a public hearing on August 29, 2019 and determined that each s
chool within the district had sufficient and good 
quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of 
California. All students, 
including English learners, are given their own individ
ual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the 
classroom and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the Californi
a Department of 
Education, mak
ing the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all 
teachers and 
a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All rec
ommended materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. The table displays information about the quality,

School Safety Plan
 
Bell Avenue School strives to maintain a safe, healthy, nurturing and orderly school campus that encourages positive attitude
s in students and staff. 
Supervision is provided to ensure the 
safety of each student before school, during breaks, at lunch and after school. Supervision is a responsibility shared 
among playground supervisors, parents, teachers, and the administration. Gates are locked at the start of the school day exce
pt for the g
ate at the main 
entrance. All visitors to the campus must present an I.D. in at the office and wear a visitors pass at all times.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan is revised annually each March by the Safety Committee; results are reviewed immediately with all
 
staff, both certificated 
and classified. Key elements of the plan focus on disaster preparedness and staff response during an emergency. Emergency dri
lls are held on a regular 
basis; fire drills are held once a month, earthquake drills are held twice a ye
ar, and lockdown drills are scheduled four times a year.
 
 
Students at Bell Avenue School are guided by the PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention and Support) system that promotes actin
g respectfully, responsibly 
and safely. Students are taught to ask themse

program is to provide students with opportunities to learn self
-
discipline through a system of consistent rewards and consequences for their behavi
or. 
Parents and students are informed of discipline policies at the beginning of each school year through a Parent/Teacher/Studen
t Compact, assemblies, a 
parent handbook and newsletters. Bell Avenue students have specific norms for how to behave responsibl
y, respectfully, and safely. The table displays 
the suspensions and expulsions figures for the school, district and state. Expulsions occur only when required by law or when
 
all other alternatives have 
been exhausted.

In the Robla School District, we believe in life
-
long learning, and all staff members in the 
district are given opportunities to continue their learning.  It 
does not matter how long you have been working as a teacher, an administrator, as a bus driver or as a custodian, there are s
till new skills to be learned.  
This is the concept behind profess
ional learning days that take place throughout each school year in the Robla School District.
 
 
Each year, the school schedule includes professional learning days for all staff.  The first professional learning day is sch
eduled on the day before the first 
d
ay of school.  The second day is scheduled at the end of the first trimester of the school year.  The third day is scheduled 
at the end of the second 
trimester of the school year.  Students in the district do not attend school on these days in order to all
ow all staff to participate in learning activities.
 
 
For classified staff, the focus of these learning days is based upon the learning needs of each department in the school dist
rict.  Learning for custodians 
may focus on the correct use of new equipment t
hat has been purchased for use by the custodian in their cleaning duties.  Learning for kitchen staff may 
focus on the use of new equipment or on healthy meal planning or scratch cooking techniques.  Secretaries may focus their lea
rning on new office 
softw
are or on social
-
emotional learning practices for use with students who come to the office.  Each department lead will consider the needs of t
he 
staff, seek input from staff members or may be directed to focus on a specific learning need.  For example, all
 
staff members at all levels are being training 
in appropriate response techniques in an active shooter situation.  A district team was trained in specific techniques by a c
onsulting firm.  The training 
team then conducts training for different department 
staff members on different days during the school year, until all staff members have been trained.
 
 
For certificated staff, teachers, administrators, and specialists, professional learning has focused since the start of the 2
017
-
2018 on specific high impac
t 
instructional practices.  The Robla School District, in partnership with the Resourcing Excellence in Education (REEd)  Cente
r at the University of California 
at Davis, has defined specific guidelines around effective teaching.  These research
-
based prac
tices focus on specific teacher behaviors and specific 
student behaviors which increase active learning, language production and higher
-
level thinking in the classroom. Another area of focus is 
Social/Emotional Learning which provides specific strategies f
or ensuring schools are calm and students feel safe physically and emotionally.
 
 
Professional Learning Support Teachers (PLSTs)then provide on
-
going support for staff as they take these practices back to their classrooms for 
implementation.  The PLSTs are 
classroom teachers who work in pairs.  Each pair, one at first grade, one at fourth grade and one at sixth grade, offer 
support in a variety of ways.  They might come to a classroom and model a specific teaching practice.  They might serve as a 
substitute 
in a classroom to 
allow the teacher to leave and observe another teacher at his/her grade level who has shown exemplary skill with a certain te
aching technique.  They 
might team teach a lesson with a teacher and offer coaching in real
-
time as the lesson is
 
taking place.  PLSTs are available to teachers at all grade levels 
and all levels of experience.  A teacher may contact them directly for support with all practices that are the focus of our p
rofessional learning.
 
 
PLSTs and Principals receive on
-
going tr
aining in coaching techniques to ensure that they are gaining skill in effective practices for supporting teachers.  
Special coaching training sessions take place throughout the school year.  Specific techniques are discussed and coaches are 
then encourage
d to put 
them into practice.  Follow
-
up training sessions allow coaches to share their experiences and refine their skills.
 
 
Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) are also at the core of professional learning for all certificated staff.  PLC train
ing wa
s provided to all teachers 
and administrators during the 2017
-
2018 school year.  Our system has been designed to allow teachers to meet in PLC teams throughout the school year.  
Classroom teachers meet in grade
-
level teams at their school on a weekly basis
 
when their students are in enrichment activities with enrichment teachers.

In addition, District
-
wide PLC meetings are held once a trimester where all teachers at a grade level are able to meet together as a PLC focused on
 
the 
needs of that specific grad
e level.  Principals and PLSTs also support this work as they provide coaching to PLC teams as needed or as requested.
 
 
Additional Professional Learning activities are offered to all staff after the end of the school day.  The focus of this trai
ning is bas
ed on the needs of staff.  
Recent focus areas for teachers include technology in the classroom, social
-
emotional learning, and foundation skills in English Language Arts.  All staff 
members at all levels are also invited to Resilience training, which takes
 
place throughout the school year after school.  Resilience focuses on the 
relationships we have with the members of the community we serve with a special emphasis on cultural sensitivity.  This work 
is done in consultation 
with the Roberts Family Developm
ent Center and our Resilience consultant, Dr. Sara Truebridge.
