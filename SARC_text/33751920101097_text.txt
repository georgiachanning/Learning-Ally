Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
French Valley Elementary School has 34 general education classes and two special day classes. Our facilities include a 
multi
-
purpo
se room, a computer lab and a library media center. TVUSD's Maintenance and Operations division works 
diligently to ensure our facilities are clean and safe for students, teachers, and staff. The district follows a comprehensiv
e 
preventive and deferred mai
ntenance program to offset costly repairs and minimize disruptions to the instructional 
program. Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and bathrooms are clean and well maintained. The 
District's elementary and middle schools each have on
e full
-
time lead custodian during school hours. In addition, the 
carpets at each site are steam cleaned 2
-
3 times per year. In order to respond to work requests in a timely manner, the 
district utilizes an electronic work order system. When a site secretar
y, custodian or administrator has a request, they can 
put it into the system directly. This makes for a more time efficient processing of work orders.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes t
he Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only e
ligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); an

Parent 
volunteers are an important part of the educational program at French Valley Elementary School. Many programs 
and activities would not be possible without parent involvement. Activities are highlighted on the school website and 
through informational fliers
. Parents wishing to volunteer may contact the school office or the PTA. We have parents 
involved in volunteering in the classroom to assist teachers in providing managerial or small group instructional support 
for students. Fathers or other positive male 
role models are involved as Watch D.O.G.S. to provide safety and instructional 
support for students. Many parents are involved in the PTA and assist throughout the year in school events, such as the 
School Festival, Book Fairs, and fundraisers. FVES is cur
rently assisting parents of EL students to come and volunteer in 
classrooms through our ELAC committee.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School safety is a high priority for our school and district. Our school has a comprehensive School Safety Plan. The plan 
covers topics such as disaster response, safe ingress and egress and ensuring a safe and or
derly environment. A team of 
10 faculty members, including both certificated and classified staff, met on January 24, 2019 to review the current safety 
plan and provide input. The safety plan is scheduled to be reviewed and updated again in early 2020. Fol
lowing the 2020 
update, it will once again be presented to faculty members.
 
 
Our school is a closed campus that is fully enclosed by fencing. School visitors and volunteers are required to sign in at th
e 
front office prior to entering campus. Our volunteer
s and visitors have different badges to clearly communicate that they 
have entered through the office and followed the appropriate background check requirements. Volunteer badges and 
visitor passes are worn at all times.  Volunteers and visitors all check 
in through the Raptor system with a current I.D.  In 
instances of emergency, we use an automated telephone system to contact parents with pertinent information.
 
 
To better prepare our teachers, students and staff for emergencies, our schools conduct fire, 
earthquake, and 
lockout/lockdown drills regularly throughout the school year. Education Code mandates that all elementary and middle 
schools hold a fire drill each month they are in session as well as an earthquake drill at least four times during the scho
ol 
year. High Schools are required to have two fire drills and two earthquake drills.

District Commitment to Learning for All Students
 
 
The Temecula Valley Unified School District is committed to ensuring that each and every child in its care receives a 
rigorous, multifaceted educational experience preparing them for the demands of college and career.
 
 
TVUSD teachers engage in active staff
 
development throughout the year by attending:
 
 
In
-
District training sessions provided by staff and consultants.
 
 
Site
-
based training sessions presented during staff meetings and committee/grade level meetings.
 
 
One on one training provided during formal o
bservations and post observation conferences.
 
 
Staff members are sent to national and state conferences to fine
-
tune instructional practices in specific areas.
 
 
Teachers with specialized training are given opportunities to train their peers, and provide in
structional support as teacher 
leaders.
 
 
Standards Based Instruction
 
 
Staff development focuses on 
implementing the New State Standards and state frameworks in English
-
Language Arts, 
Science, social science, and Math, K
-
12. Routine district sessions bring teacher leaders and principals together to devise 
and refine the curriculum and assessments. Teams 
began by identifying priority and supporting standards, grouping the 
standards into units of instruction, and crafting common interim and summative assessments, developing scoring rubrics, 
and discussing sound grading practices for each course/grade. Leade
rs return to sites to facilitate their grade level/course 
teams in reviewing the work, suggesting resources, and providing feedback for the refinement committees.
 
 
Collaborative Teams
 
 
Teachers are divided into Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) base
d on content area and grade level. All 
instructional staff participate almost weekly during professional growth time meeting in their PLC groups to align 
curriculum, refine teaching strategies, create assessments, analyze student achievement data and trans
ition to New State 
Standards.
