Principal's Message
 
I'd like to welcome you to Castle Rock Elementary School's Annual School Accountability Report 
Card. In accordance with
 
Proposition 98, every school in California is required to issue an annual 
School Accountability Report Card that fulfills state and federal disclosure requirements. Parents 
will find valuable information about our academic achievement, professional staff,
 
curricular 
programs, instructional materials, safety procedures, classroom environment, and conditions of 
facilities.
 
 
We are an International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme School, one of twenty in the state 
of California. Our vision is to develop
 
all students into lifelong inquirers and learners and to be 
responsible, compassionate, and ethical citizens of the world. Our school motto is "nurturing 

a
 
balanced program based on the state standards and the IB PYP Programme of Inquiry. Castle Rock 
is very proud of its rigorous academic programs, innovative Research Hub and one to one 
technology learning environment, school
-
wide Spanish instruction, and da
ta based intervention 
program. Our students continue to be successful as strong readers, writers, mathematicians and 
creative thinkers. In 2016
-
2017, we developed our Castle Rock Leadership Academy (CRLA) where 
students apply to become leaders and ambassad
ors in the areas of technology, school pride, and 
International Baccalaureate models of inquiry.  We currently have 120 3rd
-
5th grade CRLA 
members. Staff and parents successfully partner together to create a learning environment that is 
rigorous and inclus
ive of all students. We are excited about our school, curriculum and programs, 
and welcome all to join our community.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

All training and professional development activities at Castle Rock Elementary School revolve around the California State Sta
ndards and the IB Primary 
Years Programme Framework. During the past four school years, the staff at Castle Rock Elementary School 
selected areas of focus using assessment 
data such as summative assessments, district benchmarks, and CAASPP data.  Professional development is either held as after s
chool workshops, during 
the day, and/or mentoring with small groups, depending on the need
s of the staff.  Our most recent professional development has been devoted to:
 
 

 
Thinking Maps
 

 
Units of Study/Writers Workshop

Social Emotional Learning (SEL)

Decisions concerning selection of professional development activities are performed by the principal using tools such as teac
her input to determine the 
areas in which additional teacher training may enhance classroom instruction and increase student achiev
ement levels. Castle Rock Elementary School 
supports ongoing professional growth throughout the year. Teaching staff are provided the opportunity to participate in distr
ict

development workshops or training session as 1) a supplement to sit

-
based staff development, 2) for reinforcement of or follow
-
up on previous training, 
or 3) follow
