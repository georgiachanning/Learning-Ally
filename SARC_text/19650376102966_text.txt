About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card 
(SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan
 
(LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For m
ore information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF w
eb 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school 
district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Monte Vista has a School Site Council (SSC) consisting of parents, teachers, support staff an
d the administration. The SSC meets at least four times per 
year to ensure the dollars spent at Monte Vista addresses the needs of our student population. We view our SSC members as our
 
voice to the community. 
They disseminate the information discussed at 
our meetings to the community to keep everyone informed and up to date. The collective efforts of our 
parents and staff members result in an environment of academic success for all students.
 
 
Our English Learners make up about one
-
fourth of our student pop
ulation. At Monte Vista, we have an English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC). The 
committee meets several times a year to bridge the gap between our non
-
English speaking parents and the school. At our meetings, we share information 
about the school and ad
dress the concerns of our non
-
English speaking parents.
 
 

 
 
Parents or community members who wish to participate in leadership teams, school commi
ttees, school activities, or become a volunteer may contact 
Principal Durand at (562) 946

School Safety Plan
 
At Monte Vista, all staff members have trained in emergency procedures and all students take part in regularly scheduled emer
gency drills. Food, water, 
medical and other emergency 
supplies are updated annually to ensure each campus is ready to respond in the event of an emergency or disaster. 
Campuses are carefully monitored before, during and after school hours. Break and lunch periods are supervised by school pers
onnel. Our school
 
is 
closed campus and it is secured with security fencing. All visitors are required to report to the office and to wear a visito

school grounds. The School Safety Plan is updated annually in September. It delineates state law
, district policies, discipline plans, emergency procedures, 
duty schedules, zone maps, and staff responsibilities. Monte Vista maintains constructive relationships with law enforcement 
agencies to ensure the 
safety of our campus.
 
 
At Monte Vista, an empha
sis is placed on encouraging our students to do their best academically and behaviorally. Through our school wide Positive 
Behavior Intervention Supports (PBIS) multiple incentives including First Friday Assemblies, Trimester Awards, and PBIS Wildc
at Ticke
ts are used to reward 
students fin those areas. We have a progressive discipline policy for students who engage in inappropriate behaviors, which m
ay include but is not limited 
to recess and/or lunch detention, phone calls home, and parent conferences. Ext
reme offenses may require other consequences and those would be 
discussed during the parent conference. Every situation is dealt with on an individual basis. The School Safety Plan is revie
wed and revised by 
stakeholders, the last update was February 2019.
  
The plan is discussed with the entire staff before the yearly "Great ShakeOut" in October.
