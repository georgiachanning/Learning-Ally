School Description
 
Welcome to Oliveira Elementary School.  Oliveira Elementary is a diverse and collaborative 
community and together we pursue excellence in academic achievement through the use of 
rigorous thinking skill
s, while working with each student, staff member and the community on 
character development.
 
 
Oliveira's Vision Statement (2018)
 
Oliveira Elementary School where all students are caring, collaborative, lifelong learners.
 
 
Oliveira's New Mission 
(2018)
 
Oliveira Elementary School provides a challenging learning environment that holds high 
expectations for all learners.
 
 
Professional collaboration is a strong belief on our campus. Through professional learning 
communities (PLC's), we are aligned wit
h district goals, as we work together looking at student data 
and finding the best strategies in supporting our students to become college and career ready.
 
 
In English/Language Arts, our focus is on small group instruction with the intention of moving 
stu
dents' into higher levels and to assist in closing gaps  We provide additional support using 
appropriate strategies for each grade level to improve reading comprehension at students 
individual reading levels.  Students are taught to understand the value of
 
brain input and output 
(making meaning of the text), schema and metacognition.
 
 

assist students in increasing their knowledge of overarching math concepts rathe
r than isolated 
skills.  Currently best practices through the Silicon Valley Mathematics Initiative (SVMI) support 
students in sharing their mathematical knowledge. Teachers and students utilize a tool called, 
"Moby Max" to support differentiation within t
he classroom.   The comprehensive coursework used 
in both Math and Language Arts aligns to the current state standards.
 
 
Our students with disabilities also benefit from the same set of strategies when delivering state 
standards.  Our Resource Specialist P
rogram (RSP) staff use a collaborative model to help students 
within the regular classroom setting and in the RSP setting.  We offer speech and language support 
services to our elementary students.  We continue to examine and modify our teaching practices 
to ensure that each student is ready for success in junior high, high school, college, and their career.
 
 
Oliveira Elementary School continually seeks ways to meet the needs of our varied student 
population. We focus on student outcomes using a variety of 
instructional methods. We are a 
school that is moving forward and focused on continuous improvement. Oliveira continues to 
welcome and collaborate alongside our multicultural families to engage educationally, socially and 
emotionally.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The main fact ab
out textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core classes for all stu
dents. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Oliveira Elementary originally opened its doors in 1959, and is a well
-
kept school campus, consistently clean and free of litter, due to the hard work of 
our custodians.  Oliveira also works with community members, s
uch as Niles Rotary Club, to assist with beautification projects throughout the campus.  
Each year, Oliveira hosts a school Make
-
A
-
Difference Day, where parents, students, teachers, staff, and community members work together to perform 
maintenance around t
he campus.  Our site consists of 3 main buildings housing our office, staff room and work area, multi
-
use room, kitchen, and 17 

hol
ogist, four general 
education classes, and 2 special day classrooms.  Oliveira also houses 14 temporary portables (13 portables added Summer 2016
, and 1 portable dated 
2004) consisting of 12 classrooms, 1 restroom block and 1 book room.  Oliveira Elementar
y also has a child care center and a co
-
op preschool on Fremont 


completed in the 2018
-
29 school year.
 
 
We
 
continue to improve the outside environment of Oliveira Elementary with a focus on the atmosphere around campus.  All of the 
plants are California 
native and drought resistant.  Painted silhouettes showing students engaged in activity are painted on the f
ront of the building, alongside our California 
Distinguished School Logo, eagle pride mural on the side of room 19 (2014) and in the courtyard (2017). In addition a quote e
ncouraging Kindness was 
painted by a scout troop (2018).  Also mural displaying our 
S.O.A.R. focus is displayed on the side Library wall.  This was painted also by a scout troop 
(2018).   Memory bricks by the school's flagpole add an inviting, friendly character to our campus. Students from the local H
igh School girls soccer team 
assisted
 
with putting up our three character traits on outside walls, "Make Good Decisions, Solve Problems, and Show Respect." The Nil
es Rotary Club 
built a garden for the Kindergarten playground.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent ex
perts from our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the Facilities 

ons you see on this report.  
Please no
te that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report. Since that time, those conditio
ns may have changed.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Oliveira's school safety plan is monitored by the Oliveira's School Site Safety Commi
ttee comprised of community members and staff.
 
 
Both the Principal and Assistant Principal, along with teachers monitor the school grounds for 15 minutes before and after sc
hool as well as at all recesses 
as part of their professional responsibility.  Pare
nts and community members serve as noon supervisors to monitor the children and ensure their safety 
during lunch and lunch recess.  Administrators and teachers regularly review school rules with students for safe and responsi
ble behavior in the classroom 
a
nd on the playground.  Oliveira is a PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports) school where we practice consistent s
chool
-
wide rules using a 
behavior system matrix. The S.O.A.R. matrix reminds our students to be Safe, On task, Act responsibly, and
 
Respectful. Oliveira practices being a closed 
campus and all visitors report to the office when they enter, where they receive an Oliveira visitor sticker to wear througho
ut their stay and sign out on 
vacating the campus.
 
 
The Oliveira site safety plan ma
kes sure all staff, students, and community members are aware of the operations in the unfortunate event of a disaster. 
It includes procedures for emergencies, ingress and egress routes, and inventories of emergency supplies.  Additional highlig
hts include
 
our school goals 
to ensure a safe, clean, working and learning environment for the entire Oliveira community. The safety plan identifies those
 
staff members who are part 
of the chain of command and their areas of responsibility. The plan is available to a
ll staff and community members, and input is encouraged throughout 
the school year. There are safety training for staff on emergency preparedness at various times throughout the school year. O
liveira proudly collaborates 
with local law enforcement agencies
 
to keep Oliveira a school that is safe for all students, staff, and visitors on campus. The campus houses a large 
secured metal shipping container, between rooms 19 and 29, where emergency supplies are housed and checked each school trimes
ter for evidence
 
of 
tampering (last updated 10/29/19).  It holds a myriad of emergency supplies from water, stretches, flashlights, cones, pop
-
up tents, mylar blankets, 
medical supplies etc. In addition, each classroom houses an emergency backpack, sanitary bucket, first 
aid kit, and a working fire extinguisher.
 
 
Oliveira holds monthly fire drills and earthquake/disaster drills four times a year, and we hold ongoing training for staff o
n emergency preparedness. A 
morning safety squad, comprised of third, fourth, fifth and 
sixth
-
grade students and a parent volunteer who monitor the safe drop off and pick off zones, 
and making sure students arrive safely by ushering students away from sidewalks and onto campus grounds quickly and efficient

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. 
 
Below is the 
amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
2017
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations th
ese days are sometimes reduced.
