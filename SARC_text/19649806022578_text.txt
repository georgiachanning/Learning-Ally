District Vision
 
As a community of learners, the Santa Monica
-
Malibu Unified School 
District works together in a 
nurturing environment to help students be visionary, versatile thinkers; resourceful, life
-
long 
learners; effective, multilingual communicators and global citizens.  We are a rich, culturally diverse 
community that values the c
ontributions of all its members and strives to promote social justice.  
We exist to assist all students in their pursuit of academic achievement, strength of character, and 
personal growth, and to support them in their exploration of the intellectual, arti
stic, technological, 
physical and social expression.
 
 
John Muir Elementary School Mission Statement
 
Our mission is to ensure high levels of meaningful learning and flexible thinking for every student 
by nurturing creativity, collaboration, 
resilience, and diverse relationships.
 
 

 
Our mission at John Muir Elementary is to ensure high levels of meaningful learning and flexible 
thinking for every student by nurturing creativity, collaboration, resilience, perseverance, and 
di
verse relationships. We are a small and diverse community with no more than two classes per 
grade level.
 
 
We focus on student learning

what students need to know, what they already know, how we 
know that they know it, and how we respond when they meet stan
dards, exceed standards, and 
approach standards

and the community in which this learning occurs. We use innovative teaching 
methods to help each student meet our mission and reach grade
-
level standards such as Cognitively 
Guided Instruction in mathematics 
and Readers and Writers Workshop models in literacy. Social 
and emotional growth is supported by the CARES philosophy and Restorative Practices that 
recognize that each student must feel a sense of belonging, significance, and fun while providing 
structure
 
for that connection to happen. In addition to our regular program, we offer Specialized 
Academic Instruction (SAI) for students with special needs and Reading Intervention and support, 
both with a reading instructor and our partnership with the nonprofit 
organization Reading 
Partners and Speech and Language Instruction. Students with emotional needs are supported by a 
part
-
time social worker/therapist provided our partnership with Family Service of Santa Monica 
and the City of Santa Monica. High
-
achieving 
students are served within the regular classroom with 
differentiated curriculum.
 
 
John Muir partners with PSArts and PS Science and offers weekly visual arts and STEM programs. 
All students have an opportunity to participate in music on a weekly basis, and
 
work with 
technology at every grade level. John Muir Elementary also encompasses a state Head Start 
Preschool; a preschool classroom for students with special needs; before and after
-
school child 
care for grades K
-
3; and with the City of Santa Monica, CRE
ST, a structured after
-
school program 
for fourth and fifth graders; as well numerous after
-
school enrichment classes for all grades.
 
 
At John Muir, we are extremely fortunate, through the collective efforts of our wider community, 
to have additional staff 
and enrichment opportunities for our students through funding provided 
by the Santa Monica Education Foundation (SMEF). Our literacy coach; many instructional 
assistants; art teacher; primary music teacher; and Reading Partners are funded through the Ed 
Fo

classrooms and schools run smoothly

providing supplies for teachers, after school enrichment 
opportunities, and field trip transportation.

19 School Accou
ntability Report Card for John Muir Elementary School  
 
Page

of

The original John Muir School was built in
 
1923, and in December 1996 moved to its new location and building at 2526 Sixth Street in 
Santa Monica, and it is the neighborhood school for Ocean Park. We are named after John Muir, a well
-
respected environmentalist and 
one of the fathers of our Nationa
l Park Service. We are a public elementary school serving the small student body of around 300 students 
that reflects the cultural diversity of the surrounding community.
 
 
The School Plan includes three goals in the areas of: academic achievement, English 
Language Learner progress, and school climate. Our 
progress indicators include, but are not limited to: a yearly increase in student use of evidence based arguments, and increa
se in positive 
attendance numbers. The School Site Council reviews progress regu
larly and makes recommendations.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by 
state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are re
quired to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is
 
to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions 
and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our school site was newly built and completed in 1997. The classroom space and playground space are more than adequate for hi
gh
-
caliber teaching and 
instruction. All teachers have a shared office space with a dir
ect phone line and voice mail access. All staff members have either a desktop or laptop 
computer with Internet capability and email access. All classrooms have technology access. There is computer access available
 
in or adjacent to each 
classroom and a mob

ry 
library coordinator. Our School Site Council receives reports from the joint Muir/SMASH Safety Committee that includes staff 
mem
bers and parents to 
ensure that our school facilities are safe for all students and staff. The facility is well
-
maintained and is in well
-
functioning condition. We are proud that 
our school district takes great efforts to ensure that our school is clean, s

-
time 
day custodian, one  and a half night custodians, and by our district maintenance and operations department. The principal and
 
staff work closely with 
the site custodians and
 
district maintenance and operations department to ensure that the school building and grounds are clean and free of litter an
d 
graffiti. There are no emergency needs as defined by the Office of Public School Construction.
 
 
In January 2011, a new pedestria
n gate was installed. In fall of 2011, a remote access keypad was installed at the new pedestrian entry gate. This allows 
school staff to control access to the campus from the main office. The system includes two
-
way voice communication and a video camera 
that enables 
staff to recognize visitors at the gate.
 
 
In 2018 the district addressed major roof leaks throughout the school by resurfacing all deck and a major roof renovation. Wi
th the infusion of operational 
dollars the district will continue to address
 
deferred maintenance issues.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School 
Year 2019
-

John Muir Elementary families are an energetic group who look for ways to make our school a more equitable and enriched exper
ience for each of our 
students. The most visible organizations include our SSC (School Site Council), PTA (Parent Tea
cher Association), our ELAC (English Learners Advisory 
Council), Spanish Language Parents Group, and our AAU (African American Union). Equally important, and assuredly less visible
, are all of the supportive 
volunteers who work in the classrooms, chaperone
 
field trips, share their expertise or their language and culture with our students, find outside sources 
to further academic enrichment and support, or simply create a consistent expectation and space where students can do homewor
k and daily reading.
 
 
The
 
John Muir PTA and parent groups actively support our school by planning community
-
wide celebrations, organizing fund (and fun) raising activities, 
and providing hours of volunteer support in our classrooms. Meetings are generally held second Wednesday of 
the month at 6:30 p.m. with child care 
provided. The English Learners Advisory Council meets quarterly on Wednesday mornings at 8:30 a.m. Everyone is welcome, and t
ranslation is provided. 
The African American Union meets on the first Thursday of each month
 
at 6:30p.m. Our Spanish Language Parents Group meets the last Friday of the 
month at 8:30am. Check local calendar for specifics. Parent and community volunteers are welcome and encouraged in our classr
ooms. Once trained 
and cleared by the school office, t
eachers coordinate classroom volunteers and field trip chaperones.

ability to reflect on their decision
-
making, creating a sense of self
-
advocacy and resiliency.
 
 
In compliance with California Education Code, the John Muir staff and parents annually review and assess

All teachers and staff in SMMUSD participate in ongoing professional development through 
banked time, a total of 90 minutes of meeting and 
professional development time each week at each site. Areas of districtwide focus for teacher and administrator professional 
development include 
implementation of curriculum guides and other areas that are 
determined by a review of summative and formative data from all school sites and the 
collection of input from teachers and administrators. Among the primary focus areas for professional development in SMMUSD ar
e the following:
 

 
Developing Professional Learn
ing Communities
 

 
California Standards for ELA and Math and Next Generation Science Standards

standards
-
based curriculum and instructional delivery
 

 
Math coaching

expanding our understanding of the standards for mathematical practice
 

 
Using data to improve cla
ssroom instruction
 

 
Supporting students with special needs
 

 
Differentiated instruction for all students, including English Learners
 

 
Site Focus
-
student use of evidence
-
based arguments to support their claims, orally and in writing, in all subject areas
 
 
A 
variety of methodologies are used to provide professional development, including coaching and mentoring and working in Profes
sional Learning 
Communities. SMMUSD provides coaching through several programs such as BTSA, National Boards, literacy and math coa
ching, and Site Leadership 
Teams. Additionally, professional development occurs through workshop series during banked time and/or after
-
school opportunities.
 
 
Each August, all teachers new to Santa Monica
-
Malibu are invited to participate in New Teacher Ac
ademy, a professional development and orientation 
to districtwide curriculum and instructional initiatives. All eligible new teachers are encouraged to participate in BTSA. Te
achers interested in applying 
for National Board Certification may participate in
 
the process and can elect to be supported by teachers who have already achieved National Board 
Certification.
