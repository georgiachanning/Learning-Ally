Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud
y.

meetings, our quarterly math parent nights for I

events: Fall Festival, Movie Night, Winter Performance, Read Across America, fundraisers, and field trips. Our parents can 
also attend the ESL classes on Tuesday and Thursday, The Fam
ily Leadership Institute (February/March), and they help 
teachers in the classroom.  Parents need to fill out the volunteer packet, located in the office, and return completed 
following all steps.  Parents must be cleared through the Safety Office to volun

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
The common goal of all categorically funded
 
programs in the San Bernardino City Unified School District (SBCUSD) is to 
ensure that all students
--
including English learners, educationally disadvantaged pupils, African American, Hispanic English 
only, gifted and talented pupils, and pupils with excep
tional needs
--
attain mastery of state and local standards.
 
 
The educational program at each site is based on an improvement planning process that includes members of the school 
community such as the principal, teachers, support staff, parents, and students
 
(at the secondary level). These 
stakeholders form the School Site Council (SSC). The SSC develops and annually monitors, evaluates and revises a plan 
called the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA). The SPSA, based on self
-
study and collaboration, e
nsures that all 
of the resources available to the school are coordinated and focused on providing a high
-
quality educational program in 
which all students can achieve success.
 
 
Some students have difficulty mastering academic state and local content standa
rds. They may be at risk of not meeting 
graduation requirements. For these students, categorical program funds are provided. Categorical funds are supplemental 
educational dollars used for supports that augment the core instructional program and increase t
he academic success of 
these students. Categorical funds provide items such as additional personnel time, staff development opportunities, 
supplemental student materials, and other specialized services, equipment, and supplies.
 
 
Categorical programs common
ly found at SBCUSD sites are:
 
* Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Title I, Part A
 
* Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF)
 
 
Additionally, categorical programs have been established at the district level to provide important services and 
instructional support
 
that help increase student success. Categorical funds in this category support District efforts in the 
areas of:
 
* Vocational Education Basic Grant Award (Voc Ed)

2006
 
* ESSA Title II, Pa

LEAs are encouraged to use evidence

based interventions that are reaso

A of the ESSA, to improve student achievement for those students not meeting grade level standards. At the local level, 
SBCUSD identifies schools with greatest needs, based on a variety of data, including
 
local and state student progress 
indicators, to provide additional resources and services to the schools (referred to as Targeted Support for School Progress 
or TSSP). Additionally, the California Dashboard is used to identify schools and student groups i
n need of Comprehensive 
Support and Improvement (CSI), Targeted Support and Improvement (TSI), and Additional Targeted Support and 
Improvement (ATSI).
