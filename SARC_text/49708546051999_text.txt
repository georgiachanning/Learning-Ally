Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

environment.  We believe that our task is raising global citizens with competencies in reading, writing, proble

and flexibility.  We encourage curious minds to find alternative paths to success, make connections between lessons and 
the world and build up one another through friendship and kindness.
 
 
Our students understand that their education is devoted t

learners. Educational expectations are both motivational and challenging, providing students w ith opportunities for 
instruction at their individual level. Academic learning is enriched throug

We are dedicated professionals who share resources and 
value each other. We work together creatively and 
collaboratively for our students.   We are committed problem solvers who are lifelong learners and encourage the same 
in our students. We celebrate our differences and the diversity within our learning comm
unity.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP]
 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight
 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant co
gnitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or 
programs 
of study.

We have both formal and

organizations that weigh in on decisions and programs. Volunteers make many programs available to students that would 
otherwise not occur. Parents and family m
embers regularly volunteer in classrooms, in the garden, and as coordinators 
for annual events, such as the Latino Dinner, walkathon, PTA family nights, Dine & Donate Fundraisers, and the Teaching 
Garden.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety Plan is reviewed annually and follows a District plan that includes monthly drills as well as an annual 
lock down drill. The School Safety 
Plan includes duties and resources necessary in any emergency. The PTA has a storage 
shed providing water, food, and emergency supplies for each child. Monthly practice drills are held with staff, which 
reinforces safety requirements for students and staff
 
alike. We hold an annual professional development afternoon to 
review basic first aid, emergency shut off locations/procedures, student release protocols, table top emergency scenarios, 
etc.

Four (4) professional development days are built into the work year calendar. With recent textbook adopti
ons, PD has 
focused on training teachers on new curriculum.  At Valley Vista, we've also used PD days to focus on our shift to Primary 
Years Program with the International Baccalaureate.  Teachers are building units of inquiry, drafting a school
-
wide 
progr
am of inquiry and generally preparing for this major pedagogical shift.  Curriculum trainings were decided by our K
-
12 Curriculum/Staff Development Committee.  IB/PYP Training days at Valley Vista were decided on by staff consensus.  
Teachers are supported
 
in both areas through early release Wednesday mini
-
trainings/refreshers, grade level 
collaboration time and other training opportunities offered by the district.

Professional development days focused on new math curriculum trainings.  At the si
te level, we focused on research, 
discussion and decision making around becoming an International Baccalaureate PYP School.  Curriculum trainings were 
provided by the publisher.   Our IB work included guest speakers, videos, research, discussion and a fiel
d trip to visit a 
nearby IB School.
