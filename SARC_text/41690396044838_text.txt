School Description
 
Baywood Elementary School is a self
-
consciously principled and caring 
community of students, staff 
and parents who share a sense of common purpose and commitment to the learning of every 
individual. We believe that learning is a function of the whole child. While we offer a rigorous, 
academic curriculum, we also provide lear
ning experiences for our children which embrace our 
diversity and include the fine arts, character development and social emotional literacy and 
responsibility. Baywood's mission is for all members of the Baywood School community, students, 
parents, teache
rs, and staff, to work interactively towards a lifelong love of learning, in a respectful, 
safe, supportive and challenging learning environment and to provide our students with the new 
survival skills needed to succeed in a globalized era. In 2010, and ag
ain in 2020, Baywood was the 
proud recipient of the California Distinguished School Award.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The San Mateo
-
Foster City School District makes great efforts to ensure that all schools are 
clean, safe, and functional. To assist in these efforts, the 
District has developed and the Board of Trustees has approved, a District
-
wide Facilities Implementation Master Plan in order to bring each school site 
up to district facility standards for educa
tional excellence. To support that effort, in 2008 the community passed a $175 million facilities bond to repair, 
renovate, upgrade and increase capacity at District schools. Bond funding has been used to upgrade facilities over the past 1
0 years. A lunch 
shade 
structure and age appropriate play structures were added to the campus, student classroom furniture was replaced, exterior pa
inting was completed, 
and perimeter fencing was installed for school security.
 
 
In 2015, the community once again passed a $1
42 million bond (Measure X). Phase I is well underway, adding classrooms and a gym at Abbott and Borel 
and a gym at Bayside Academy, in addition to a new fourth elementary school in Foster City.
 
 
With the passing of the State Facilities Bond in November 20
16, the District will seek any State Modernization matching funds on a percentage basis, to 
assist with the expenditures for any major planned modernization work projects.
 
 
The District's Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the sch
ool in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner, 
while the Operations staff ensures that the schools are kept clean. A work order process through a program called "Akita Box"
 
is used to ensure efficient 
service; emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority. In addition to responding to emergency repairs in a timely manner, the maintenance department 

 
 
Most District schools are staffed with
 
at least one day, and one night custodian to provide a clean and hazard
-
free environment. Some of the larger 
schools, particularly the middle schools are staffed with one day custodian and two or three night custodians. The Principal,
 
along with the maint
enance 
staff, work with the custodians to develop cleaning schedules to ensure clean and safe schools. The custodial staff follows t

which are available at the District Office. In addition, the District uses a facility surv
ey instrument developed by the State of California's Office of Public 
School Construction to evaluate the conditions of each schools facility. This evaluation is completed annually for each site.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

Baywood has a very active and supportive PTA, School Site Council and English 
Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC). These groups work closely together 
to shape the direction of the school. They provide insight and perspective about our site plan. Their efforts compliment the 

learning and academic success for a
ll students. They offer assistance to teachers in individual classrooms, in the school library and in our dream lab. The 
PTA provides financial support for Baywood's support staff and social emotional learning program, and parent education classe

offers cultural 
enrichment activities and assemblies for students as well as a science fair, arts and science day, talent show and art show. 
The PTA also sponsors Literacy 
Week, author visits and book fairs to reinforce Baywood's emphasis on literacy and 
developing lifelong readers. Finally, in order to promote community 
service, the PTA supports a service
-
oriented Student Council and Project Wee Care which helps members of the San Mateo community who are in need 
of assistance with food and clothing. For m

Professional Development
 
 
The San Mateo
-
Foster City School District is committed to 
providing quality professional development opportunities for all staff. Training is available 
through three professional development days, staff meetings, scheduled release times during the school year, on early release
 
days and during the 
summer. Our prim
ary focus for professional development is aligning instruction to meet the California State Standards and the implementation 
of our 
adopted materials for mathematics and English Language Arts/English Language development. Professional learning opportunitie
s integrate content 
development and research
-
based instructional practices to meet the needs of all learners, especially English Learners, Students with Disabilities and 
Socio
-
economically Disadvantaged. Professional Development in SMFCSD is grounded in th
e California State Standards and the research from the 
California State Adopted ELA/ELD, Mathematics and NGSS Frameworks. Elementary teachers have the opportunity for training in l
anguage and literacy, 
science and mathematics. Middle School teachers receiv
e subject specific professional development on the California Standards and strategies to support 
conceptual understanding and improve student learning.
 
 
Teachers engage in a variety of Professional Development structures including, site or department spec
ific PD, teacher learning communities within and 
across sites and in departments or grade levels 
-
 
both in large and small groups. Our district also coordinates district
-
level training with site
-
based 
professional development opportunities based on site da
ta. Over the last year, district and site leaders developed professional learning opportunities by 
evaluating and adjusting our professional growth strategies, first by gathering immediate feedback (e.g., exit tickets and fe
edback surveys) from teacher 
and
 
leader training and collaboration sessions. This data was then used to adjust and focus training and collaboration strategies
 
during the year. We also 
evaluate and adjust professional growth strategies through on
-
going examination of student performance d
ata (academic and wellness). District 
leadership meets quarterly with school leaders to review current student data, to identify the professional growth causes for
 
student successes and 
challenges, to monitor the impact of key professional growth strategie

SPSA. In parallel with this work, site leaders lead the same process with teacher teams using more specific data (e.g. grade
-
level and classroom data), 
where they couple that
 
data with teacher reflections on their professional learning and plan month
-
to
-
month adjustments in professional learning 
strategies and yearly adjustments in their SPSAs. District leaders also lead a similar process with SMFCSD teacher union repr
esentati
ves to elicit their 
feedback on the district professional growth strategies and to get their recommendations for strategy adjustments in the dist
rict LCAP. Additionally, 
starting this year, SMFCSD will gather once
-
a
-
year survey feedback from teachers on th
eir professional learning needs and on their experience of current 
strategies which will inform yearly adjustments to LCAP and SPSA professional growth strategies.
 
 
Our beginning teachers also receive additional professional development provided by our Dis
trict
-
based Induction program. Veteran teachers can 
participate in a Peer Assistance Review (PAR) program for individual support.
