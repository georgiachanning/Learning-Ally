School Description
 
Mission Statement: In Order to bring our vision into reality, we will:
 

 
Develop cooperation within the community
 

 
Foster students' creativity
 

 
Teach responsibility
 

 
Provide quality 
instruction of California Common Core Standards.
 
 
Encourage opportunities for students to think critically and solve problems.
 
 
Vision: The students, families, staff and surrounding neighbors of Ethel Phillips School are working 
together to support all stu
dents to develop cooperation with peers, creativity, personal 
responsibility and accountability.  Students will achieve academically and develop critical thinking 
and problem
-
solving strategies that will lead to success in an ever
-
changing world.
 
 
Descript
ion: Ethel Phillips is tucked away in the City Farms neighborhood near the Northern Franklin 
business district.  The school has many generations of our families that attended and continue to 
attend as part of tradition and some for loyalty.  Our student po
pulation has and continues to be 
largely Hispanic, but always diverse. Our attendance area covers a region that includes formerly 
Maple Elementary school (now closed) attendance area.  Students from that area are bussed onto 
campus for safety reasons. Over
 
50% of the population is bilingual, most of which are Spanish 
speaking families.   The needs of the neighborhood continue to warrant the need and support for 
our Bilingual Early Exit Transitional program.
 
 
We offer a K
-
3 bilingual program which is to supp
ort families of Spanish speaking homes.  The 
opportunity to use the Spanish support at home to acquire academic language in Spanish until a 
full transition is made toward the end of 3rd grade year.  The ultimate goal of the program is to 
acquire academic E
nglish by having a strong foundation in academic Spanish while working with 
the same content areas as their peers in other grade levels. Instruction in English exists as part of 
the English Language Development time in each grade level, in other subject ar
eas depending on 
the grade level, and informal English exists during recess and other interactions with classes from 
traditional classrooms.
 
 
Ethel Phillips is one of the districts early adopters of Balanced Literacy, which is a structure to 
support readin
g and writing with specific teaching points, independent work and sharing 
opportunities.  Students are working toward increasing the rigor of academic conversations in all 
content areas as is the school district.  Many of the lessons are part of larger uni
ts of genre studies 
which are deepening the understanding of students knowledge.  Even during math instruction, the 
structure of lessons follows the pattern within Balanced Literacy.  The goal is to have students 
discussing solutions, working collaborative
ly and thinking critically about the possible solutions in 
a positive, responsible but with a critical eye.
 
 
With the ever
-
changing world, it has been an area of interest for the school to allow more access 
to relevant technology.  With some district suppo
rt, classrooms are now providing opportunities 
for students to use technology such us iPod, iPad, laptops (Mac and PC) as intervention and often 
as part of the curriculum.  Access currently varies between classrooms, but is now available to all 
students.  
Additional tutoring and clubs have also begun to use technology as a tool in class.  The 
Balanced Literacy structure is incorporating more technology as part of the tools of the trade.

Over the past few years, the community has asked for ongoing support for students in need of interventions which thus far inc
lude, but 
are not limited to; academic, social
-
emotional and some mental health.  This has been an additional focal area with diffe
ring levels of 
intervention.  First, at a universal level, students in need of intervention (of any kind) are exposed to the classroom 'firs
t instruction' with 
our core academic curriculum, and also with Social Emotional Learning (SEL) with the curriculum 
of Second Step and other strategies 
including trauma informed practices and Positive Behavior Support Systems among other practices.  The staff has access to var
ious training 
opportunities in SEL supportive strategies and instruction.  Beyond these in clas
s supports, Ethel Phillips also provides intervention with 
small groups for academic support in the areas of Reading, in English and Spanish (when in bilingual classes) provided by our
 
Intervention 
and resource teachers and instructional aides.  There are 
also supports in place for non
-
academic interventions with the Student support 
Center which is staffed (.5 FTE) with a Coordinator and matched with district support with a social worker.  Additionally, so
cial work 
interns, and nursing interns functioning a
s mentors are coordinated to work with students.  Parent meetings are also conducted by District 
personnel to reach out further into our community.
 
 
Beyond these supports, there is also support for the use of the intervention known as Reading Partners whic
h provides one
-
on
-
one 
support at the reading level of each student referred to the program.
 
Community support exists in various ways, including but not limited to Reading Partners volunteers working with individual st
udents.  The 
volunteers are from variou
s agencies, including the following:

The after school program at Ethel Phillips offers 
families an opportunity to have students participate in the after school program which 
has a curriculum including physical recreation, science, health, nutrition and more, as well as homework time for students. I
n addition to 
START, other engaging activiti
es provide enrichment or extra
-
curricular activities after school such as: Intel PC Pals, Knitting club, Art club, 
and sports.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California
 
is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agenci
es (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data report
ed in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/a
c/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of 
study

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators 
and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including ELA 
Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Ling
uistically Relevant Teaching and Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through this program deeply align with the needs of our ind
ividual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and co
nnect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson design.

Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outside of contracted hours. In 
addition to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunity for teachers to engage
 
in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening 
their content knowledge, strengthening their instructional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of responsibility.
