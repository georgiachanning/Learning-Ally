Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019

Safety is our number one priority at McKinley School.
 
 
Our teachers ensure that each student is part of our school community through bi

wide Caring Schools 
assemblies. Teachers follow up with weekly classroom meeting

character trait and reflect on our three universal expectations, (1) Be Safe, (2) Be Respectful, and (3) Be Responsible. The 
staff at McKinley believes that having students who are engaged in their l
earning and invested in their school will result in 
a safe school.
 
 
McKinley has a clearly defined Emergency Response Plan. We have a school nurse on staff to assist with health and safety 
issues and staff members are trained in First Aid and CPR. Active s
hooters. Staff and students practice simulated 
emergency response drills. McKinley holds monthly emergency drills (fire, earthquake, and lockdown) to ensure that we 
are prepared in case of an actual emergency.
 
 
McKinley complies with California Education C
ode and all District discipline policies to maintain a bully
-
free and safe 
campus. McKinley has a school
-
wide dress code to ensure that clothing and footwear support student safety and academic 
success.
 
 
Visitors to McKinley must sign in and get a guest pass in the school office. The Petaluma Police Department is responsive 
to calls and provides consultation in the areas of safety and violence prevention. Our custodial staff does an excellent job 
of mainta
ining a clean and safe facility. McKinley students and staff take pride in keeping our school clean.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan for McKinley is reviewed annually and amended as needed with the approval of 
the School Site Council.
