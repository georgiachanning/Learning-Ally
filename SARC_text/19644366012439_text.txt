By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Barranca Elementary School, built in 1950, is located in the s
uburban City of Covina in the San Gabriel Valley.  The 
community has accepted the challenge of guiding students from the once largely prosperous citrus
-
growing community 
into a new age of a rapidly changing suburban area.  Barranca currently has a populati
on of 630 students from diverse 
neighborhoods in the Covina area.  74% of Barranca students are in the Free and Reduced Lunch Program.  A diverse 
population represents Barranca students with 73% Hispanic, 14% Caucasian, 5% African American, 4% Asian, and 2
% 
Filipino.  12% of Barranca students are English Language Learners.
 
 
For more than a century, Covina
-
Valley Unified School District has served the communities of Covina, West Covina, 
Glendora, San Dimas, and Irwindale.  Covina
-
Valley Unified School Distri
ct, established in 1896, serves approximately 
12,000 students in Kindergarten through 12th grade on traditional school calendar systems. The District is comprised of 
nine elementary schools, three middle schools, three comprehensive high schools, one conti
nuation high school, an 
independent study program, and an adult education program.
 
 
Barranca provides several specialized programs to students from Kindergarten through 5th grade.  A Gifted and Talented 
Education (GATE) Program serves 43 students in cluste
red groups in fourth and fifth grade classes.  Every student at 
Barranca needing instructional support receives it based upon the Response to Intervention Model for English Language 
Arts, Math, and English Language Development.  Small group instruction is 
provided by classroom teachers, the learning 
specialist, and instructional aides to help students who are struggling academically.  English Language Mainstream 
students receive instruction from teachers trained in English Language Development (ELD) and Spe
cially Designed 
Academic Instruction in English (SDAIE).  Structured English Immersion students receive ELD, SDAIE, and primary language 
support.  Two special education teachers and a speech pathologist provide specialized academic instruction and/or 
thera
py for qualifying students with special needs.  Barranca hosts two transitional kindergarten classes for 4 year old 
students who will be turning 5 between September 2nd and January 31st.  Students learn a modified kindergarten 
curriculum and transition to 
a traditional kindergarten program the following fall.  Recent legislation has provided for an 
extension of TK enrollment.  Currently C
-
VUSD has extended TK enrollment through January 31st.  Kids Korner, a District 
Day Care Program, has developed a special
ized curriculum to provide an enrichment program after school.  Currently, 88 
students attend the program located on campus.  A student discipline and empowerment program (PRIDE) encourages 
students to make good choices and become self
-
motivated and self
-
d
isciplined.
 
 
Based on evaluation of student progress, Barranca's programs are reviewed and revised each year.  Current focus remains 
on closing the achievement gap and moving English Language Learners towards proficiency.
 
 
A library media center includes a
 
computer lab, research and production center, presentation center, MakerSpace, library, 
and workroom.  A learning specialist assigned to the library media center provides comprehension instruction to non
-
proficient students and coordinates intervention pr
ograms for struggling students.  The learning specialist supports the 
staff by consulting with teachers on appropriate strategies to integrate technology across all curricular areas, collaborates
 
with staff regarding researched based instructional strategi
es, and serves as a coach to support student learning.

In partnership with Code to the Future, Barranca Elementary is a Computer Science Magnet School.  Barranca students 
have one to one Chromebooks and are learning CODE as their second language.  While c
reating a college going culture, it 
is essential that Barranca students in grades TK
-
5 use their 21st Century skills of collaboration, critical thinking, creativity, 
and communication.  Computer Science is a normal discipline in every classroom every day.
 
 
An active Parent Teacher Association and strong business partnerships are supportive of the school and contribute to the 
funding needs of specialized programs.  Many teachers serve on district committees and provide leadership roles on 
curricular issues. 
 
Barranca was identified as a California Business for Educational Excellence Honor Roll School in 2009 
and 2012.  The strong community support and excellent school staff contributed to Barranca School being recognized as 
a 2004, 2008, and 2012 California D
istinguished School, a Gold Ribbon School in 2016, and a Title I Academic Achievement 
Award School in 2012 and 2016.
 
 
BARRANCA VISION STATEMENT
 
Barranca Elementary School, in partnership with parents, students, and our community will provide a safe, 
nurturing 
environment that promotes responsibility, accountability, respect and a long
-
lasting motivation for learning.  We will 
deliver a challenging, balanced academic program enabling students to gain academic excellence, pride through 
achievement, and 
the opportunity to achieve their greatest potential.
 
 
BARRANCA MISSION STATEMENT
 
Barranca Elementary School is a learning community committed to students achieving academic excellence using a 
rigorous academic curriculum built on a foundation of "effective
 
first instruction" delivered by a highly qualified staff in a

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress 
[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or
 
programs

Safety of students and staff is a primary concern at every school 
throughout the District.  Each school complies with laws, 

preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disast
er. Fire and disaster drills are 


esource Officers 

example, updates are completed if a school discipline policy is added or modified, changes are made to the campus map, 
addi
tions and/or modifications are made to the telephone trees, etc.  All visitors must check in at the school office and 
wear a visitor badge while on school grounds.  During lunch, recesses, and before and after school, staff members 
supervise students and s
chool grounds, including the cafeteria and playgrounds, to ensure a safe and orderly environment.  
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan was developed by administrators, other school staff members, and Los Angeles 
County Office of Education staff members.  
It is reviewed, approved, and evaluated by the School Site Council in 
cooperation with local law enforcement in order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997.  The plan provides students and 
staff a means to ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. C
omponents of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan 
include the following: child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster 
response procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress from school, sexual harassme
nt policy, and suspension and 
expulsion policies.  The plan is reviewed annually with school staff.  An updated copy is available to the public at the scho
ol 
and District Office.
