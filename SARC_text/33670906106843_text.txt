By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 27, 2019
 
 
Jurupa Unified School District conducts an evaluation of instructional materials to adopt materials that best meet the 
needs of students. The district conducts adoptions on a districtwide basis. The review process includes a committee o
f a 
majority of classroom teachers in the appropriate discipline (Education Code Section 60210). In addition, all instructional 
materials are in compliance with social content standards. When making adoption decisions, the adoption committee uses 
the conte
nt standards, the curriculum frameworks, the State Board of Education
-
adopted evaluation criteria, and the 
reports on each adoption as resources. The final decision for selecting and recommending textbook adoptions is with the 
adoption committee. The most 
recently adopted textbooks were selected from the state
-
approved list.
 
 
All students, including English learners, have standards
-
aligned textbooks checked out to them, to use in class and to take 
home, in each of the core curriculum areas of reading/langua
ge arts, mathematics, science and history/social science; 
foreign language and health; visual and performing arts; and science laboratory equipment for grades nine through twelve 
as appropriate.
 
 
Elementary students receive core curriculum textbooks on the
 
first day of enrollment.  Middle school and high school 
students receive textbooks checked out to them at registration days a few days before the first day of school.  All students 
enrolling after the first day of school have core curriculum textbooks che
cked out to them by the Library Clerk on their 
first day of enrollment.

School 
Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Sunnyslope provides a safe, clean environment for learning. Our custodial staff includes a full
-
time day, a mid
-
shift, and a 
full
-
time night custodian who perform basic cleaning operations d
aily in every classroom. Our office, library, restroom 
facilities, and multipurpose room are entirely adequate to support our instructional programs and are handicap accessible.
 
 
Sunnyslope was built and opened in 1988. We have 42 classrooms, 15 of which a
re portable classrooms, 8 more are semi
-
permanent portables, and there are multiple mini
-
classrooms. Our Speech and Reading Specialist Programs (RSP) operate 
out of full classrooms. Sunnyslope is home to two AM/PM classes for SDC Preschool and also State P
reschool. We also 
have an upper grade SDC classroom. Our Intervention Teachers share a classroom but push
-
in to mainstream classrooms 
to provide services. Sunnyslope has two playgrounds; one for Kindergarten and one for grades first through sixth. Activity
 
supervisors, teachers, and other staff members are available before, during, and after school to ensure students are safe 
throughout the schoolday.
 
 
All classrooms are currently equipped with mounted projectors. All teachers in grades K
-
6 have been given 
a district laptop 
and students in grades second through sixth have a Chromebook.  In 2014, the eRate project allowed our school to upgrade 
internet/network infrastructure to prepare for the Smarter Balanced assessments. This has been funded through a distr
ict 
secured grant. We continue to promote the use of technology in each classroom to prepare students to be college and 
career ready.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress 
[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or
 
programs 
of study.

Sunnyslope Elementary School has safe school strategies that include information on the status of school crime and the 
following elements: safe school programs, child abuse reporting procedures, disaster response proc
edures, suspension 
and expulsion policies pursuant to Education Code Section 48900, 48915, and 49079, the Districts Discipline Handbook 
and Sexual Harassment Policy, our school dress code, and procedures and rules for safety on the way to and from school 
a
s well as during school hours. This plan is updated every year and approved by School Site Council by March.
 
 
Staff and students practice emergency drills monthly. Disaster drills are held twice a year. Our district wide Disaster Drill

. Our site has emergency water, food supplies, first aid supplies, radios, lights, and tools for emergency 
situations. We also promote anti

The Jurupa Unified School district is committed to providing high
-
quality, research based professional development to all 
of its teachers, responding to requirements set by CDE. During the 
2018
-
2019 school year, staff development continued 
to focus in the areas of California Common Core State Standards; BSEL; ELA, NGSS Science, and Mathematics Units of 
Study; Transitional Kindergarten teacher training (JUSD Education Services Professional De
velopment Program, provider); 
GATE teacher training. These trainings provided teachers with the skill and tools necessary for implementing high
-
quality 
instruction to a range of students in their TK
-
12 classrooms.
 
 
Staff development is also a major focus a
t Sunnyslope. Sunnyslope staff in grades 2nd through 6th have participated in 
Guided Reading Training. During the summer, 4 teachers attended AVID Summer Institute and 6 teachers attended 
GoogleCamp. In October, an AVID district coach presented a three
-
goa
l boost session which worked as a refresher for 
AVID strategies. Other teachers attended GLAD training. Dual Immersion Teachers attended the Riverside County Dual 
Immersion Consortium in the fall and will attend a second day during the spring. Teachers ret
urning from conferences or 
workshops have opportunities to present key strategies from the workshops. Teachers collaborate closely on Wednesdays 
(minimum days), and have 2 release days during the year to plan, analyze student work, and share strategies. In
 
addition, 
the third grade team of teachers participated in Impact Teams.
