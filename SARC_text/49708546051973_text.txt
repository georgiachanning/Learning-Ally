By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

literate, compassionate and socially responsible 
members of their community in the 21st century. To achieve this mission, McNear provides a safe environment where 
students are engaged in meaningful learning which asks them to communicate, collaborate, thin

h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The McNear School Safety Plan is reviewed by staff and parents at School Site Council meetings annually. The current 
safety plan was reviewed by staff and the school site council on 
2/14/19. The plan was recently reviewed again in 
December 2019 PTA and Site Council Meetings. It is currently undergoing revision for next year with efforts to keep it a 
living and continuously improving document. It incorporates all of the most recent pro
cedures recommended by the State 
and District. Preparation for emergencies occurs with monthly drills, and evaluations of equipment and procedures. School 
employees report any facility needs in a timely manner. We are particularly proud of the condition of
 
our campus and its 
facilities. Excellent custodial practices are the basis for the safety and aesthetics of the school.
 
 
The contents of the McNear School Safety Plan include: definition of a safe school, McNear School description, school 
vision, assessme
nt of current status of school crime, child abuse reporting procedures, disaster/emergency procedures, 
suspensions and expulsions, procedures for notifying teachers of dangerous pupils, sexual harassment policy, school

teacher professional development interest/need. The area of highest 
interest/need were selected as topics for the four 
(4) professional development days. The four (4) professional development days were divided into elementary and 
secondary topics, and the PD was delivered in a workshop model with a variety of sessions offe

sessions offered included, language arts implementation of our new adoption, Guided Language Acquisition Design

and environmental literacy. Teachers also attended workshops, trainings, and conferences provided by the Sonoma 
County Office of Educati
on, among other outside providers. To support implementation, several committees have been 
formed and meet regularly to plan for continued teacher support. The K

met and planned the four (4) professional developmen
t days. All teachers participated as members of Professional 
Learning Networks (PLNs) and met monthly to further their collaboration. Staff are attending responsive classroom 
trainings as well as bias and inclusivity trainings offered in the area. Some of 
the additional trainings and workshops are 
in addition to the four professional development days. Substitute teachers are brought in on an as needed basis.
