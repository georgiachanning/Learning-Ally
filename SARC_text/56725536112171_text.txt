About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abo
ut the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal
 
or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the S
tate priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education populat
ion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
alig
ned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that 
satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Parent Involvement
 
Tierra Linda parents serve an important role and partnership on our 
campus. We have an active Parent Teacher Association (PTA) that provides programs 
for our students and raises funds to finance enrichment opportunities. Many parents regularly volunteer in our classrooms to 
help students with reading 
and to assist with cla
ssroom learning centers. We elect parents to serve on our School Site Council (SSC). The SSC also approves the funds used for
 
specific 
purposes and our School Plan for Student Achievement.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the Stat
e priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Tierra Linda Elemen
tary. The school is in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining 
to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The School Site Safety Plan is reviewed and updated in the spring and 
fall of each year by the 
School Leadership Team 
and reviewed by the School Site Council. All revisions are annually communicated to both classified and certificated staff. T
he 

 
dr
ills are conducted on a 
monthly basis throughout the school year. Lockdown drills are held as needed. There is a designated area for student drop off
 
and pick up. Visitors must 
sign in at the office and receive a badge. Unauthorized visitors are not permit
ted on campus.
