By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Accountability Report Card is designed to inform our parents and community about Franklin Elementary School. We 
have high academic and social standards for our students. Our goal is for students to become effective and productive 
members of our communi
ty. In order to accomplish our goal, a mission statement was developed for every member of 
our school community to know and achieve. Our Mission Statement is a product of a combined effort of student leadership 
and adults in our school community. It reflec
ts a desire for our students to become socially and academically responsible.
 
 
The mission of Franklin Elementary School is to provide a safe learning environment and the experiences necessary for 
students to become Friendly, Responsible, Achieving, Nice, 
Knowledgeable, Loyal, Imaginative and Noble. Franklin School 
students wrote this acrostic and all school community members embrace the message. The community envisions our 
school as a partnership in which students and their parents can learn in an environm
ent that educates, nurtures, and 
develops the assets necessary to become responsible community members. We expect our students to be proficient 
readers, writers, and mathematicians at their grade level and adopt the principles of our PBIS program. Franklin
 
students 
believe that they should all be Respectful, Responsible, and Positive.
 
 
Franklin Elementary School was established in 1903 and is situated near the center of the town of Redlands, two blocks 
from the University of Redlands. The school neighborhoo
d consists of single family dwellings, apartment buildings, 
duplexes, a shopping area, three churches, and a university. We are pleased that we can truly be a neighborhood school.
 
 
Franklin Elementary School employs a principal, 1 assistant principal, 28 r
egular education teachers, 1 innovation 
specialist, 1 math intervention teacher, 1 state preschool teacher, 2 SDC preschool teachers, 2 special education teachers 
(SAI), and an elementary school counselor.  Additionally, the district provides a speech ther
apist, school psychologist, and 
credentialed enrichment teachers. Franklin has community based tutoring through the University of Redlands, THINK 
Together, YMCA, Micah House 1, Micah House 2, America Reads, and Redlands High School service learning. Parent
 
community volunteers, an active PTA, and local service clubs also play an important and active role in providing support 
for our students. We have an average of 15 community volunteers on our campus daily.
 
 
Our school community is committed to making ever
y child proficient in math and reading. All personnel and resources are 
directed toward this goal. Our uniform staff development demonstrates our commitment to be a community of learners 
with curriculum aligned to the Common Core State Standards. The clima
te of the school is positive for all members and 
there is a strong sense of school pride. Our dedicated staff continues to embrace the resources of our community and sets 
high standards for academic growth for all children.
 
 
Franklin Elementary has adopted
 
the Positive Behavior Intervention and Support philosophy (PBIS) where all students are 
taught how to exhibit appropriate behaviors in Respectful, Responsible, and Positive ways throughout the campus.  A 
team of teachers provide professional development f
ocused on tiered interventions and strategies to the staff on a 
monthly basis. Students are given positive reinforcements, both verbally and tangible to help shape their social and 
emotional development.

Last year, Franklin Elementary has opened up the Ga
rner Holt Innovation Lab.  The Garner Holt Innovation Lab at Franklin 
Elementary is a partnership between Redlands Unified School District and Garner Holt Education through Imagination. 
This partnership will bring a whole new world of experiences to our st
udents. All students in TK through 5th grade will 
have experiences with engineering and the engineering process through activities provided by Garner Holt. These 
engineering challenges will spark curiosity and iteration potential for students to bring to t
he AniMakerspace to design 
and/or create a new component or prototype that will improve on the original design. Teachers can use the 
AniMakerpsace to extend their lessons in innovative ways as well. Imagine students writing a script, design period piece 
co
stumes, programming an animatronic figure, and utilizing green screen techniques to tell the story of the life of a gold 

 
 
In addition to the multifacet
ed learning opportunities, students will be exposed to entrepreneurship experiences through 
the experience of running a business. Students will design and create products that will be sold. They will determine price 
based on materials costs, time, and mach
inery maintenance. Students will create advertisement, run web pages, and learn 
real world applications to their math, reading, science, social studies, digital citizenship, and art lessons. All products s
old 
will be created using the various machines in t
he AniMakerspace. The possibilities for our Franklin Falcons is truly endless 
with the Garner Holt AniMakerspace.
 
 
Franklin Elementary School has adopted the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement format in developing the goals and 
objectives for o
ur school. Through this process, Franklin School continues to provide an exemplary, coordinated 
comprehensive program that will best meet the needs of the school and its clients. The 
School Plan
 
for student 
achievement ensures categorical services and all 
school personnel present a cohesive and articulated program that 
provides all students access to the core curriculum. The coordination of services is facilitated through monthly staff 
meetings, written communication and dialogues designed for collaboration
 
of services. Our school provides and directs 
specific personnel, services and programs to students diagnosed as having special needs. The programs and approaches 
are designed to enhance our students success and growth by developing prescriptive approaches
, which supplement 
and/or modify classroom instruction to enable the students to learn the district core curriculum and supporting their 
successful learning experiences. All students with special needs are referred to the appropriate person/program. Specia
l 
Education, Intervention programs, English Language Development, Alternative Core, Gifted and Talented Education, and 
Counseling Services are organized to maximize the educational services of the student learner and minimize the disruption 
to programs and
 
class instruction.
 
 
English Learner Program:
 
Students receive classroom instruction appropriate for their needs through a collaborative, coordinated effort of the 
classroom teacher, extra support teacher, and support staff as appropriate. All EL students 
have access to the core 
curriculum. Limited English Proficient students will acquire second language proficiency in listening, speaking, reading, 
and writing. Their self
-
esteem will be enhanced as they study to become viable members of a multi
-
cultural soc
iety.   A 
variety of instructional methods, such as SDAIE strategies and other activities are used to increase English proficiency. The
 
EL Advisory Council (ELAC) meets on a regular basis with an agenda designed to address the concerns of the bilingual 
com
munity, parent education, and student success. The council actively recruits parents for classroom volunteers and 
PTA, School Site Council, and the District English Language Advisory Council  (DELAC).
 
 
Title 1 School
-
Wide Program:
 
Parents and staff work to
gether at School Site Council and English Learner Advisory Council meetings to make decisions 
on programs, staffing, and critical expenditures. Special Education services are offered to identified students in the 
Specialized Academic Instruction and Speech
 
and Language programs. School programs implemented to assist Title 1 
students include, but are not limited to the following: America Reads, South Coast Counseling, and PBIS.
 
 
Special Education:
 
Students with special needs receive services from our Special
ized Academic Instruction teachers, speech therapist and 
other support staff. At risk students are identified through the Intervention Support Team or through the IEP process to 
determine the most appropriate intervention or remediation. Counseling service
s are also offered through our school 
counselor, Building a Generation social worker or South Coast counselor. The Family Resource Center also supports the 
well being of all students, pre
-
school through 5th grade by offering social services and community o
utreach programs.

Our school community is committed to making every child a reader and all of our resources are directed toward this goal. 
We have uniform staff development and hard work to become a community of readers with curriculum grounded in the 
Com
mon Core State Standards. Our dedicated staff embraces the resources of our community and sets high standards for 
academic growth for all children. The result of our teamwork is dramatic.  Because of the schools continued success and 
innovative programs, o
ur preschool program received the 2001 California School Board Association Golden Bell Award 
and our outstanding community partnerships and collaborations earned us the 2006 California School Board Association 
Golden Bell Award. Franklin received the Golde
n Bell award again in 2012 for Bridging the Achievement Gap through our 
"H.E.A.R.T" philosophy (Honoring Excellence, Achievement, Relationship and Teamwork).   Franklin School was recognized 
as both a 2002 and 2011 California Achieving School and a 2002, 2
006, and 2010 California Distinguished School.  In 2013 
and 2015 we were named a California Business for Education Excellence Honor Roll school.  Most recently we were 
awarded the Gold Ribbon Award in 2015.  Our school has a strong sense of school pride, a
 
dedicated teaching staff, and a 
safe and caring learning environment.  We are proud of our school and welcome the opportunity to share our programs 
with visitors and guests.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
In addition to the 
unique physical structure of Franklin Elementary School, the interior of each hexagon supports a variety 
of habitats. The interior gardens were designed to display desert plants, chaparral, a pond with goldfish and plant life, 
citrus trees, deciduous and e
vergreen trees. Students and parents participate in the maintenance of the gardens. During 
the first trimester of the 2014
-
2015 school year, all interior and exterior doors had peep holes installed and old model 
doorknob style doors were replaced with lock
able safety bars.  These two additions to our doors increases our ability to 
keep our students and staff safe should there be a safety issue.  All classrooms have flexible seating, projectors, document 
cameras and sound, thus enabling teachers to use techn
ology in all curricular areas.  The governing board has adopted 
cleaning standards for all schools in RUSD. A summary of these standards is available at the school office, at the District 
Office, or at www.redlands.k12.ca.us. The principal works daily with
 
the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school. Two full
-
time custodians perform routine maintenance of the school facilities and work 
orders are written to a central service office for additional repairs/replacements.
 
Monthly safety inspections are 
completed by the lead custodian and staff members review the document.  During the first trimester of the 2018
-
2019 
school year, the exterior of the entire campus was repainted.  Also, a mural representing our Garner Holt An
imatronics 
Lab was painted on the wall adjacent to Colton Avenue.  In addition, water tolerant landscape was installed on our campus.

School Safety Plan (School Year
 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Franklin School utilizes data from our monthly School Safety Committee meetings, ELAC meetings, SSC meetings, 
Leadership team input, and suspension/expulsion reports to evaluate the current status of school climate. A Disaster 
Preparedness Plan
 
is adopted in March of each school year and is reflective of the school's safety needs. The key 
components of Franklin's Disaster Preparedness Plan include a description of school disaster response procedures and the 
responsibilities of each Disaster Prep
aredness Response Team.  Fire drills are conducted on a monthly basis with additional 
drills (earthquake, shelter in place) done every other month.

During the 2017
-
2018 school year, teachers met on an average of one minimum day per month and one full day per school 
year.  These professional development meetings focused
 
on three areas.  The first is on the reading and math intervention 
program  The second focus of professional development was with PBIS in grades first through fifth grade.  The program 
and trainings focus on assessing to find the area of need, lessons and
 
strategies to meet the need, and progress monitoring 
for growth.  The other focus of staff development involved rigor.  Principals presented the professional development to 
their staffs at their site.  Teachers are supported by Math, English/Language Arts
, and support through the math 
intervention teacher.  The math intervention teacher met with grade levels to discuss the implementation, strategies to 
address areas of need, do modeled lessons in the classroom, collaborate on lesson planning, and provide r
esources that 
teachers can utilize in their classrooms.  A team representing each grade level has also been formed to begin the training 
and implementation of PBIS.  The team continues to meet throughout the year and will come back and work with staff to 
p
repare Franklin for full implementation of the PBIS principles and practices.  New teachers are supported with coaches 
and are given PD from the district office.  Classified employees have opportunities to participate in professional 
development through th
e district office.
 
 
During the 2018
-
2019 school year, professional development followed the same format as the year before.  Teachers 
continued to meet on a regular basis to collaborate and align the curriculum with the Common Core State Standards.  
Math i
ntervention teachers continued to to work with teachers through math, ELA/writing, and reading.  Technology 
support was also provided through a Technology TOA.  Franklin continued to work on PBIS training and implementation 
by providing monthly PBIS meetin
gs and additional meetings with the PBIS team.
 
 
During the 2019
-
2020 school year, Franklin had more of a focus on analyzing various test results in order to determine 
what standards need to be retaught and in what format these standards will be taught.  As
sessments included, but are 
not limited to IABs, Common Assessments, Chapter tests, informal assessments, work sample analysis, STAR Reading, 
STAR Early Literacy, Lexia, Front Row, and other teacher assessments.  Teachers met as grade levels at least once 
per 
month to analyze assessment data, as well as met with the Principal once a month to look at student growth.  Other 
professional development included PBIS training for Tier levels one through three, as well as how to help students going 
through trauma. 
 
Teachers were provided Professional Development in ELD instruction and the process for reclassifying 
students and the new ELPAC test given one time per year.  District personnel provided professional development in 
technology, such as Google Classroom.  D
istrict personnel also provided training on IABs and hand scoring the IABs.  
Professional development took place on minimum days, after school staff meetings, and during the instructional day as 
needed.  Teachers were supported after the professional devel
opment with follow up meetings, data analysis, and 
classroom observations.

On an average, teachers were supported with professional development on minimum days one time per month, as well 
as one full day per school year.  The professional development sess
ions were mandatory.  There were also additional 
voluntary professional development sessions offered by the school site administration, math intervention teacher, and 
district personnel throughout the school year.  Classified employees were given professio
nal development opportunities 
throughout the year by district personnel.  During the 2019
-
2020 school year, campus monitors have monthly meetings 
with the assistant principal to go over PBIS strategies and Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 interventions.
