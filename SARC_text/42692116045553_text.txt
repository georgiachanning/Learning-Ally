By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Year and month in which data were 
collected:
 
December 2019
 
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Vieja Valley Elementary School are aligned to the California Content Standards. 
Instructional materials are selected from the state's most recent list of standards
-
based materials and a
dopted by the 
State Board of Education. The district follows the State Board of Education's adoption cycle for core content materials 
(English/language arts, math, science, and social science).
 
 
In the fall, the Hope Elementary School District's Board of T
rustees held a public hearing to certify the extent to which 
textbooks and instructional materials have been provided to students. The Board of Trustees adopted a Resolution which 
certifies as required by Education Code ยง60119 (1) that textbooks and instru
ctional materials were provided to all 
students, including English learners, in the district to the extent that each pupil has a textbook or instructional materials
, 
or both, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient textbooks and instructional 
materials were provided to each 
student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with the cycles and 
content of the curriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English/language a
rts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materia
ls 
used for their visual/performing arts curricula. During the 2018
-
19 school year, Hope Elementary School District did not 
o
ffer visual/performing arts classes and therefore did not require the distribution of respective textbooks and instructional 
materials. Students have music and art weekly with specialists.

maintenance and campus improvements ensure facilities remain up 
to date and provide adequate space for students and 
staff. District maintenance and site custodial staff ensure that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good condition 
are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used by school and dis

specifications

arged for new structure and a ramp put in for accessibility for all
 

 
tree trimming
 
Every morning before school begins, the custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards or other conditions that need 
attention prior to students and staff entering school g
rounds. One day custodian and one part
-

assigned to Vieja Valley Elementary School. The day custodian is responsible for:
 

 
Groundskeeping

Education Code ยง17592.72(c)(1). Vieja Valley Elementary S
chool uses a school site inspection survey to identify unsafe or 
hazardous conditions and facility improvement needs. The most recent school inspection took place in August 2019.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
