Special Education/ISSSchool Accountability Report Card 
for School Year 2018-2019
Published in 2019-2020
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by 
state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The 

SARC contains information about the condition and performance of 

each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula 

(LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a 

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they 

intend to meet annual school-specific goals for all pupils, with specific 

activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported 

in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported in the SARC. . 
 For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC Web page at 
http://www.cde.

ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF 

Web page at 
http://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 

community members should contact the school principal or the district 

office.
DataQuestDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest Web 
page at http://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional informa
-
tion about this school and comparisons of the school to the district, the 

county, and the state. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that 

provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school 

graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding 

English learners.
Internet AccessInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that 
are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the 

Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-

come, first-served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of 

operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 

on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, 

and the ability to print documents.

ABOUT THIS SCHOOL2 School Accountability Report Card for School Year 2018-2019
Mission Statement (School Year 2019-20)
The Central School Staff is committed to the philosophy that all students can and should experience success 
and reach their maximum potential.  Our purpose is to provide a well-rounded education in a child centered environment, where each student has 
the opportunity to attain a high level of academic achievement beyond mastery of basic skills, and also to develop 
critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.We believe that students educated in a structured, supportive environment where standards of excellence are 
expected will develop a positive self-concept, become life-long learners and participate constructively in society.
A Message from the Principal . . .
Central School, built in 1935, is in every way a ﬁneighborhoodﬂ school.  Most of our students live within walking 
distance.  Our proximity to downtown Escondido provides the community support whereby our students benefit 

from the experiences of our numerous partnerships, including support from the California Center for the Arts.
At Central School, all students are taught in a learning environment where a college-bound belief system is 
cultivated.  In addition, positive character traits are taught, modeled, and reinforced through our PAWS education 

program. Every decision we make is driven by the belief that all our students can and will achieve.  High expectations 

and strong support for student learning are how we work to ensure every child is successful.  We are committed to 

helping every student meet the high expectations represented by our California State Standards. Our teachers are 

committed to ongoing professional development activities that focus on collaboratively analyzing data, setting learn
-
ing targets, developing enduring understandings, asking essential questions, differentiating instructional practices, 

and choosing formative assessments.  All our teachers work together in grade level teams to continue to monitor 

growth and set academic goals for our students through NWEA/MAPs, ELPAC, and CAASPP.  We are excited to 

see our students succeed!At Central School, we are proud of the positive partnership that we have developed with families in our learn
-ing community.  A dedicated focus on student learning and parent involvement is at the center of what we do as 

an organization. High expectations for all students, academic standards, student behavior standards, and parent-

teacher relationships are part of our core values.  Our caring and dedicated staff maintains a daily commitment to 

our students and the families we serve.  Working together, we can continue Central School™s 80-year tradition of 

high academic and behavioral expectations!

Each school annually participates in a review of their Comprehensive Safe School Plan.  During this review, 
each site convenes a School Site Council meeting to review school safety policies in relation to board policy, 
administrative regulations and Education Code. Each school reviews and updates its comprehensive school safety 

plan, and the plans are annually presented and approved by the school district Board. The plans are updated 

using current discipline, attendance, health, and curricular data. The Comprehensive Safe School plan includes 

child abuse reporting procedures, disaster response procedures, suspension and expulsion policies, notification 

for teachers of dangerous pupils policy, discrimination and harassment policies, dress code procedures, safe 

ingress and egress procedures, site goals and objectives related to a safe and orderly environment, school disci
