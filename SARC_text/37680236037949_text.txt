a morning Preschool class for mild/moderate special needs students; an afternoon Preschool class 
for severely disabled children; a school library and an aft
er and before school program named 
STRETCH operated by the YMCA.  The school holds 49 minimum days per year to ensure teachers 
are receiving professional development and offers 36,000 instructional minutes for Transitional 
Kindergarten, and 61,500 instruct
ional minutes Kindergarten through Sixth Grade.
 
 
Vision for Success 
-
 
All students excelling academically and social
-
emotionally.
 
The Loma Verde vision is based on a strong partnership with parents, school, and the community.  
We are committed to 
working together with our families for the benefit of our students' future.  
Information through informal surveys, the Hanover Survey, and formal academic assessment tools 
is gathered from students, teachers, parents, and the community to enable us to stre
ngthen and 
perfect our program.  We encourage and respect uniqueness and value diversity.
 
 
Mission & Values
 
We see our students as scholars who will compete, and succeed, in college and a profession.
 
At Loma Verde, equity for all means closing the achievem
ent gap.  Students are active participants 
who develop independence through critical thinking in a rigorous learning environment where they 
will excel, compete, and succeed in a multicultural world.
 
 
Loma Verde Elementary integrates the Chula Vista Element
ary School District LCAP goals and the 
Instructional Focus statement into SPSA goals, actions, and services.  Our school community is 
continuously collecting academic data and analyzing student work, prioritizing needs, setting goals, 
and making collaborat
ive decisions.  Our focus on the social
-
emotional well
-
being and positive 
behavior support for all our students prepares our students to compete and succeed in college and 
career.  For this reason, staff development is focused on the California State Stand
ards, and the 
priorities addressed in the school plan have been determined by the staff, including representatives 
from the Instructional Leadership Team, the School Site Council, English Learner Advisory 
Committee (ELAC), Gifted and Talented Education (GA
TE), community forums, through discussion 
of assessment of student achievement.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Classroom space at our school is adequate to support our school's current enrollment.  The District maintains a planned progr
am, which ensures routine 
maintenance functions are performed on a scheduled
 
basis. Custodial staff performs basic cleaning operations daily. A locked fence surrounds our 
campus, and a security door ensures the safety of our students at all times.  Visitors to our campus must check in at the fro
nt office and wear a visitor 
badge f
or easy identification of strangers on campus.  Loma Verde maintains sufficient space for effective classroom instruction for
 
students and teachers 
as well as safe, play structures for all students to enjoy.

Research shows a high correlation between parent involvement and effective schools.  At Loma Verde, we 
recognize and value the importance of parent 
involvement.  In creating a thriving learning environment for all children, we encourage parents to visit and partner with ou
r school.  Loma Verde has an 
active Parent
-
Teacher Organization (PTO), which sponsors 
many projects for the benefit and welfare of our children.  Parents are encouraged to 
participate in school and district staff development activities, including active participation and membership of our English
 
Language Acquisition 
Committee (ELAC), Schoo
l Site Council (SSC), and Budget Advisory Committee.  During our Coffee with the Principal meetings, ELAC, PTO, and SSC paren
t 
Information meetings, parents are informed about assessment, curriculum, and instruction.  Also, we provide parents with usef
ul i
nformation and ways 
they can contribute as active school partners to ensure our children continue to receive an excellent education. This school 
year we again partnered with 
South Bay Community Services to bring the "Promotoras" program to Loma Verde, thes
e are community members that are trained to work with parents 
in meeting their needs. They have provided a wide variety of parent classes. Additionally, they have brought the school pantr
y to provide families in need 
with necessary food resources.
 
 
Loma Ve
rde is fortunate to offer parent programs on
-
site to guide and support parents with their understanding of the California Content Standards.  At 
monthly Coffee with the Principal meetings, we provide parents with opportunities to learn how to support their
 

development, our health and wellness policy along with ways to support students with homework.  In addition to strengthening 
family relationships, 
Loma Verde offers other programs, such as an anti
-
bullying program, and soc
ial
-
emotional education.
 
 
For more than 29 years, Loma Verde has participated as a Partner
-
in
-
Education with the U.S. Navy in our Saturday Scholars Program.  Over 50 navy tutors 
volunteer during the Fall and Spring to work with students one on one in resea
rching career pathways in the medical field.
 
 
We value our volunteers and invite you to make a difference at Loma Verde.  To volunteer, feel free to contact our office at

included a focus on literacy with an emphasis on comprehension, vocabulary development, full implementation of the Benchmark 
Advanced language 
arts program, social emotional learning, and mathematics.  All 
primary teachers received extensive literacy training with a focus on expository reading 
and writing on the California Content Standards.  Teachers attended specialized training in areas determined by teachers and 
the principal as part of 
their professiona
l growth.  All teachers continue to receive training on how to utilize the California Content Standards to ensure mastery for
 
all children.
 
 
Staff Development topics are detailed more fully below and included:
 
 
1.
 
Writing,  with an emphasis on reading compreh
ension and vocabulary development.  Teachers received training on the writing framework 
-
 
Step Up To Writing, the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project Units of Study. The Data Team  (DT) and all teachers hav
e been trained 
in the implementation of t
he Gradual Release of Responsibility model of instruction with an emphasis in the focus lesson/modeling.  During 
the 2018
-
2019 school year, teachers consistently used Illuminate data to develop action plans when planning to ensure the academic suc
cess 
of a
ll students.
 
 
2.
 
Reading Comprehension.  Loma Verde staff was trained in and continues to develop an understanding of the components of readin
g 
comprehension utilizing the Fountas & Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention.  Loma Verde staff works closely with d
istrict resource teachers to 
consistently fine
-
tune teaching skills in the area of reading comprehension and writing.  The Instructional Leadership Team continues to work 
with the district cohort to develop a deeper understanding of instructional technique
s that lead to higher levels of student engagement and 
productivity.  At Loma Verde, we consistently monitor student achievement with Illuminate data.  Professional development in 
analyzing the 
data and planning for instructional programs is a critical par
t of our ongoing learning.
 
 
3.
 
Deconstructing the Standards, Understanding and Analyzing Student Data, Expository Writing, Reading Comprehension for English
 
Learners 
-
 
In order to ensure students are closing the achievement gap, our teachers engage in grade l
evel discussion over the importance of teaching 
our students essential standards they need to learn to be successful in their current grade level, to help them in future gra
de levels, and to 
prepare them to compete and succeed in college and in their futur
e careers.  An important aspect of our students' success has to do with 
assessing our students' learning.  Teachers use this information (or data) to prepare lessons that will challenge students to
 
continue to achieve 
and to intervene with students who nee
d additional support.  We believe our students need to learn to be creative writers.  For this reason, 
our teachers dedicate three hours to literacy with a focus on the read
-
write connection during which time our students learn to write and make 
connection
s with the texts they read.  Our teachers receive training on Guided Language Acquisition Design strategies with an end in mi
nd 
-
 
to 
teach ALL students, including English Learners, to be high
-
achieving students.
 
 
4.
 
Social Emotional Learning is a focus of our
 
school this year.  We are in the third year of our PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention Supports) for 
our school.  Teachers continue to receive support with Restorative Practices, Second Step, and Sanford Harmony Curriculum to 
help deepen 
students self
