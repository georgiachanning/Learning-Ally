About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grad

The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of

responsibility shared among parent/guardian volunteers, teachers, and administrators.
 
 
To further safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, a comprehensive School Site Safety Plan has been developed by
 
the School Site Council. The 
Safety Plan was most recently updated in March 2018; any revisions and updates are reviewed immediately with the staff. Key e

Plan focus on the following:
 

 
School rules & procedure

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
A constructive evaluation process promotes quality instruction and is a fundamental element in a sound 
educational program. Evaluations and formal 

 
Temporary and 
probationary teachers are evaluated twice a year and tenured teachers ar
e evaluated every other year.
 
 
Evaluations are conducted by the principal, who has been trained and certified for competency to perform teacher evaluations.
 
Evaluations are based 

following: Engaging and Supporting all Students in Learning; Understanding 
and Organizing Subject Matter for Student Learning; Assessing Student Learning; Creating and Maintaining Effective Environmen
ts for Student Learning; 
Planning Instruction and Design
ing Learning Experiences for all Students; and Developing as a Professional Educator.
 
 
Due to the state fiscal crisis, additional funding from the State of California that would provide an opportunity to offer di
strict
-
wide professional 
development through
 

tate 
fiscal crisis to provide an alternative plan of action for staff development, and has established a comprehensive District
-
wi
de Professional Development 
Center (PDC). The PDC provides ongoing staff development in a variety of formats throughout the school year (i.e. during the 
school day with substitutes 
provided, after school, on
-
site, weekends, and during instructional breaks)
. In collaboration with the PDC, teachers have access to online videos and 
resources as additional professional development support.
