About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Calif
ornia is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational a
gencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data r
eported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov
/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Parents, guardians, and community members are an integral part of the support system for Garvey School District students and 
have a multitude of ways 
in which they can get involved to contribute 

attending Parent/Teacher Conferences, participating in Back
-
to
-
School Night and Open House, staying informed through notices, memos, phone calls, 
newslet
ters are other examples of involvement.
 
 
In accordance with Title 1 regulations, our school jointly develops with parents a school

There are ample opportunities for parents to participate in the governance of the school b
y joining any of the many committees such as School Site 
Council, ELAC, School Advisory Committee, and District Level Committees as well.
 
 
The purpose of the ELAC (English Learner Advisory Committee) is to advise the principal and school staff on programs 
and services for English learners 
and the School Site Council on the development of the School Plan for Student Achievement. Representatives from this group at
tend monthly DAC/DELAC 
meetings facilitated by Learning Support Services.
 
 
The SSC (School Site C

plan and revises it based on data collected throughout the year. This group meets once a month.
 
 
In addition, parents can take advantage of the numerous parent workshops that are provided by Learning Support Services, held
 
at the Dis
