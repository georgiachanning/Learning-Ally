By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
As principal of Crafton Elementary School, I am 
pleased to present to the community our annual School Accountability 
Report Card. We all continue to be proud of our students and their academic achievements, both on standardized tests 
and their daily work. Crafton families and alumni take special pride i
n this school and its over 130
-
year heritage. Our active 
PTA, School Site Council, ELAC, communities and parent volunteers all reflect this pride. Students are motivated and 
empowered to reach their full potential in safe, orderly, clean, and modernized cl
assrooms and school. Discipline is strong 
and consistent; serious incidents seldom occur. Crafton has received recognition for their strong PBIS strategies, which 
strengthens the positive school climate for all students. School spirit and positive reinforc
ement of good citizenship are 
rewarded through a variety of activities for students. While there are areas in the Report Card that highlight our program 
strengths, we have full implementation of  the Common Core Standards in language arts, and  mathematics
, social studies 
and are working toward this for science. The Common Core Standards continue to be a  top priority for our instructional 
program. We are proud to be an AVID Elementary site. We continue to work in a professional learning community to 
ensure
 
continuing growth of academic achievement for all students.  Their has been an integration of the standards and 
technology for all students in our innovation lab.  As we continue in our second century of high quality instruction for 
students at Crafton El
ementary School, this is an appropriate time to present to you our annual School Accountability 
Report Card, sharing past accomplishments, current challenges, and a bright future for Crafton students. SCHOOL 
SUMMARY Crafton Elementary School was establishe
d in 1888 in the city of Redlands on the banks of the Zanja for the 
purpose of educating the local Native American children. The site later developed into an agricultural area surrounded by 
orange groves. The school's focus then changed to serve the new po
pulation of students. Over the course of these 
130+years, thousands of students have received their primary education foundation at Crafton Elementary School. Many 
of these students 
-
 
representing five generations of Redlands families 
-
 
have gone on to dis
tinguish themselves in such 
areas as 
--
 
business, law, medicine, education, and the arts. Present enrollment figures indicate that approximately 700 
students are fortunate enough to be part of the Crafton Cougar family!
 
 
Purpose: At Crafton Elementary Scho
ol, we will provide our students the necessary tools to reach their full potential in 
our changing world.
 
 
Core Values: * Be Passionate About Learning *Be People of Character * Be Welcoming to All
 
 
Our Envisioned Future: At Crafton we give our students the
 
opportunity to discover and develop their full potential. All 
students, staff, and parents are consistently, fully, and collaboratively engaged in adaptive growth as learners, teachers, 
leaders, supporters, and positively contributing members of the schoo
l community. Our diversity is considered by all as 
one of our primary strengths; as we value our ethnic, racial, and cultural differences we also choose to unite in our 
determination to ensure the success of ALL students and staff in fully achieving distri
ct and common core standards.  Our 
students will be confidently prepared to be innovative and valuable citizens of the world.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The current school building, which includes thirty classrooms, 
a library, an innovation lab, an administrative office, and a 
multi
-
purpose room/cafeteria was modernized in 2005
-
2006. New flooring and cafeteria tables were recently installed in 
the MPR.  In 2019 our site received new heat and air conditioning units for
 
all classrooms as well as new flooring in our 
newly remodeled innovation lab.  As a result, our facilities are in good repair. Students and staff work hard to recycle and 
 
keep the campus clean and safe. A litter
-
free environment is emphasized and custodi
ans clean the campus daily. An after 
school Garden Club meets regularly to assist in maintaining and beautifying the school grounds. Our campus is monitored 
closely by the staff, and any safety hazards are addressed immediately. The staff has developed a c
omprehensive disaster 
plan, which has been communicated to students and parents. This plan will enable staff and students to remain as calm 
as possible as they deal with the events surrounding a disaster such as an earthquake or fire. MAINTENANCE AND REPAI
RS 
The governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in RUSD. A summary of these standards is available at 
the school office, at the District Office, or at www.redlands.k12.ca.us. The principal works daily with the custodial staff t
o 
devel
op cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school. When maintenance and repairs are needed, the site 
custodians are notified and the work or repair is completed, if possible.  If repairs are such that they can not be 
accomplished by the custodians, D
istrict maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good 
repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest pri
ority. The site Principal has inspected the school prior to the opening to 
students and has indicated 100% of all toilets and faucets on school grounds are in working order. A new upper
-
grade 
playground structure was purchased and installed in January 2008
, once again with funds earned by the Crafton PTA. 
Students named this playground structure Cougar Kingdom. In its efforts to ensure the most safe play area we can afford 
for all students, the Crafton PTA has provided a shade structure and picnic tables fo
r our Kindergarten playground area. 
School site custodians clean each classroom regularly and the school district provides a grounds crew who work at Crafton 
on a rotating basis. Crafton's PTA also assists in providing safe play equipment and structures fo
r our students.  A running 
track, earned by PTA fundraising efforts,  opened in January of 2016,  and we now have a Running Club, the Crafton 
Cruisers. The PTA has recently replaced the Kindergarten playground structure, named Cub Kingdom,  in November, 20
18. 
We have also added a cold
-
filtered water bottle filling station.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Crafton Elementary School utilizes data from its California Safe Schools Assessment and suspension/expulsion reports to 
evaluate the current 
status of school crime. A Safe School Plan is updated and adopted in March of each school year and 
is reflective of the school's safety needs. The key components of Crafton's Safe School Plan include a description of school 
discipline policies and procedur
es, dress code guidelines, suspension and expulsion policies, sexual harassment policies, 
child abuse reporting procedures, dangerous pupil notification, and disaster response procedures. A Safety Committee, 
which consists of both Certificated and Classifi
ed staff members, students, and parents, is in place and meets regularly to 
review safety procedures and make recommendations based on current needs.
 
 
SCHOOL SAFETY To ensure student safety before school, campus monitors, staff, and the Principal and Assis
tant Principal 
supervise the school grounds including the bus drop
-
off area, parent drop
-
off area, cafeteria, and playground.  During the 
school day all entrance areas to the school are locked. The campus is fully enclosed by security fencing and all visit
ors 
must go through the office to sign in using the Raptor system, get a visitor's pass, and gain access to campus. Crafton 
School personnel are diligent in ensuring that all adults on campus have signed
-
in at the school office. After school, 
teachers, cam
pus monitors, and administration ensure the safety of students by supervising the bus loading area and front 
parking lot which is used by parents to pick students up from school. A crossing guard ensures students cross the nearby 
streets safely. Teachers, 
campus monitors, Assistant Principal and the Principal supervise the areas until all students have 
left the campus for home.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
Crafton School receives both federal and 
state categorical funds for supplemental services for School Improvement (SSP) 
and Title 1 Categorical funds are budgeted after review and consideration by staff, school site council, and site 
administration. Categorical funds bring approximately $150,000 
to our school annually. Personnel funded for the past 
few years with categorical money include an ELD/Intervention teacher and a library paraprofessional. Title 1: Schoolwide 
Title 1 funds are provided on the basis of enrollment of students who demonstrate
 
living in socio
-
economically 
disadvantaged households. This is a federally funded program to help educationally disadvantaged students in eligible 
schools achieve grade level proficiency. School Improvement Program (SIP) This is a state funded program for
 
all 
students, kindergarten through grade five.
 
The funds from this program are used to provide supplemental materials and educational opportunities for students. 
Gifted and Talented Education Program (GATE) Students are tested initially during third grade
 
to determine qualification 
for participation in the GATE program. STATE STANDARDS: Redlands Unified School District has adopted the Common 
Core State Standards for English Language Arts andMathematics; and the California State Standards for Science, 
Histo
ry/Social Science, and Physical Education. Crafton Elementary School students continue to demonstrate their 
acquisition of these standards through the increases reported each consecutive year on Crafton's CA Dashboard.
 
 
GOALS: Our goals are aligned with th
e District's LCAP goals.
 
1) All students will successfully participate in a high quality, comprehensive, T/K
-
5 instructional base program, in order 
to foster student academic success;
 
2) All students will be educated in an environment that is safe, conduci
ve to effective teaching and learning, and is drug 
free. Students will participate in all tiers of PBIS and Crafton's Character Pillars. Students will increase their attendance
 
rate and lower their office referral rate and suspension rate;
 
3) Students
 
in G
rades TK
-
5 will participate in a high quality instructional program aligned to state standards and the 
Common Core;
 
4) Increase the number of students successfully ready for college and career; and
 
5) Close the achievement gap for underperforming subgroups
. Summary of Strengths: One of Crafton's strengths is a 
dedicated, professional staff that works to meet the needs of all students.
 
 
This professional learning community meets collaboratively to ensure student success. Staff training has been integrated 
in
to the professional day, with the staff readily willing to take advantage of every learning opportunity to ensure 
increased student achievement. Students receive daily guided reading and writing practice, direct instruction of English 
Language Arts standar
ds, directed math instruction, and grammar and spelling practice. The computer lab is currently in 
the process of being updated to the Cougar Den Innovation Lab and includes current technology such as Zspace. In 
addition, all students have a mobile device 
and Google Classroom accounts for use in their classrooms. Critical Needs 
The diverse needs of students coupled with changing demographics is a challenge for the Crafton learning community. 
Volunteers are needed, especially at the primary levels and in the
 
library. Student Objectives Each Crafton student will 
reach high standards, at a minimum, attaining proficiency or better in Reading and Mathematics. Crafton students will 
be provided with activities that will demonstrate the relevancy of technology to th
eir daily lives.
 
This will be accomplished through use of classroom technology (laptops and Google Classroom). Strategies will 
incorporate the use of our web
-
based Renaissance Learning programs, web
-
based Lexia Core5 Reading program, web
-
based Dreambox mat
h intervention, and web
-
based keyboarding program, Internet access, and the English

going professional growth for staff is a priority for Crafton Elementary School. Through the School Based Coordinated 
Program, ten shortened school days have been planned for staff development. These  partial days provide 
teachers the 
opportunity to meet in grade level teams to work directly with colleagues, while receiving additional professional training 
that emphasizes schoolwide goals on improving classroom instruction to ensure improved academic achievement for all 
stu
dents. Grade level curriculum planning and communication are also an important topic. The present staff has been 
trained in  Positive Behavior Intervention and Support (PBIS), AVID Elementary strategies, Lexia Core5 Reading program, 
Accelerated Reader (AR)
, Cultivating Rigor,  Thinking Maps,  and Common Core shifts including both Math and Language 
Arts. Each of these programs is used, as deemed appropriate at each grade level, from grade K through grade 5. Staff 
Development focuses on brain research, resear
ch based instructional practices, and on creating a language of the 
discipline that will occur from one year to the next for students. Redlands Unified School District offers a wide variety of 
staff development opportunities for all teachers and encourages
 
teachers to attend. Teachers are sent to  full day trainings 
and/or conferences on an as
-
needed basis. They are currently attending trainings on AVID Elementary pathways and 
English Learners designated and integrated curriculum.
