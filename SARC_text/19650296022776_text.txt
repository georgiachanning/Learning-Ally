School Description
 
Marengo Elementary School is located in the city of South Pasadena and serves 772 students from 
kindergarten through 5th grade. It is one of three elementary schools within the South
 
Pasadena Unified 
School District and operates on a traditional school calendar system. Marengo Elementary School earned the 
recognition as a California Distinguished School during the 2009
-
2010 school year.
 
 
Marengo Elementary School is a professional lea
rning community in which all members (administrators, 
teachers and parents) are committed to quality instruction and learning for all students. This vision includes 
both the development of our students as self
-
directed, life
-
long learners who are becoming 
resourceful and 
productive citizens and the professional growth of teachers and administrators using analysis of learning 
results and reflection on teaching practices. The Marengo community strives to provide a safe, creative 
environment with respect for s
tudents of diverse backgrounds and learning styles, and it encourages risk
-
taking and the use of higher level thinking skills to increase academic achievement.
 
 
In order to fulfill our commitment to this vision, the staff works as a team to provide student
-
centered learning, 
using developmentally appropriate curriculum and instructional strategies. Providing a rigorous, standards
-
based curriculum that integrates language arts, math, social studies, science, arts and physical education, 
teachers and administ
rators utilize data from a broad range of assessments to measure and ensure learning 
for all students and to inform educational planning and decision
-
making.
 
 
Recognizing the essential role families and the community play in the education of our students, 
all teachers, 
administrators and staff promote a positive home and school connection.
 
 
Marengo Tenets:
 
 
1.
 
We believe equal access enhances quality education.
 
2.
 
We believe that a safe environment ensures optimal learning.
 
3.
 
We believe that embracing diversity and
 
social justice leads to acceptance and tolerance.
 
4.
 
We share a commitment to learning and value it as a life
-
long practice.
 
5.
 
We believe that effective communication among all members of our community promotes 
common understanding.
 
6.
 
We value the physical, intellectual, social, and emotional capacities of all learners thus 
encouraging every student to realize his/her full  potential.
 
7.
 
We embrace critical thinking and self
-
reflection as tools for building our learning community.
 
8.
 
We belie
ve that all people must take responsibility for their own actions.
 
 
Marengo Vision Statement:
 
Marengo Elementary School will commit to support self
-
directed, life
-
long learners as they grow into 
resourceful and productive citizens. We will provide a safe, 
creative environment with respect for students of 
diverse backgrounds and learning styles. We will encourage risk taking and the use of higher level thinking 
skills to increase academic achievement.
 
 
In order to fulfill this commitment, the staff will work
 
as a team to provide student
-
centered learning using 
developmentally appropriate curriculum and instructional strategies. We will provide a rigorous, standards
-
based curriculum, which will integrate language arts/reading, math, social studies, science, th
e arts, and 
physical education. We will use a broad range of assessments to measure and ensure the growth of all 
students. We will provide time for professional development and reflection to aid staff in continuing to provide 
a quality educational program.
 
We recognize the important role families and community play in the education 
of our students and therefore we will continue to promote a positive home/school connection.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a 
School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Loc
al Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with 
data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

In 2018, the Comprehensive Safety Plan was updated by t
he school administration in consultation with local law enforcement in order to comply with 
Senate Bill 187 of 1997. The plan provides students and staff a means to ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. Comp
onents of the 
Comprehensive Safety Plan
 
include child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, 
procedures for safe ingress and egress from school, sexual harassment policy, and dress code policy. Marengo Elementary revie
ws the
 
plan annually and 
updates it as needed. The most recent copy of the plan is available to the public at the school office.

Annually, four staff development days are scheduled into the school year to address both site and district
-
level needs. 
These professional development 

entary school staffs, 
participate. Topics that have been addressed include Common Core State Standar
ds (CCSS), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), English Language 
Arts curriculum, the evaluation of student writing, Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), examination of multiple measures, d
ifferentiated learning 
strategies, Thinking Maps, curriculum 
mapping and Project
-
Based Learning (PBL).
 
 
Staff development is delivered at monthly faculty meetings, during grade level release
-
time and through attendance at various conferences.
 
 
Teachers are supported through their Path I (feedback after formal observ
ations) and Path II plans (these plans address teaching standards agreed upon 
by teacher and principal).  Additionally, grade level meetings at the school site and district
-
wide, data analysis meetings and peer planning meetings 
allow for teachers to learn
 
from their peers.  Finally, our Technology Integration Coach works individually and with small groups of teachers on 
professional development and instructional technology in the classroom.
