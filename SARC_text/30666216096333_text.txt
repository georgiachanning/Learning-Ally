By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Imperial Elementary School ranks fair in terms of repair.  Some deficiencies are noted as critical and/or widespread. 
Repairs and/or additional ma
intenance are necessary in several areas of the school site.
 
However, over the past three years, the school has received new carpeting in the classrooms, common areas, and the 
office. The external siding of the building was repair/replaced and painted sinc
e the report was filed in 2017. In the 
summer of 2019, the front parking lot and sidewalks have been modified to reflect ADA compliance. Student restrooms 
have been completely remodeled as of summer, 2019. The school continues to provide a safe learning en
vironment, both 
inside and outside the building.  Should items need repair they are noted immediately, with those identified as a safety 
concern being addressed immediately.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Imperial Elementary is proud of the generous support and involvement of its parents and community. Many of our parents 
volunteer their time and talents in the classroom often assisting teachers in working with individual or small groups of 
children, on spe
cial projects, or helping with a variety of necessary tasks. In addition, volunteers participate in assisting 
with school pictures, vision and hearing screenings, school sponsored activities, and special events during the school year. 
Parents also coordina
te numerous activities including Outdoor Education fundraisers, Holiday Boutique, Birthday Book 
Club, Book Fairs, Red Ribbon Week, Walk to School Day, Family Nights in both Art and Science, Spring Carnival, and sixth 
grade promotion.
 
 
Imperial PTA contribu
tes directly to educational activities and core curriculum. Profits from fundraisers provide students 
with the Art Masters Program, Family Nights, and a variety of assemblies and/or other educational events. Supplementary 
funds for field trips are also pro
vided. PTA funds purchase library books, quizzes for our Reading Counts program, software 
and equipment for the computer lab, classroom materials and student incentive rewards. The Imperial Elementary School 
PTA annually supports extra/co
-
curricular enrich
ment programs, field trips, classroom supplies, instructional and student 
technology and other items as needed. Imperial Elementary receives support with funds or services from the local 
community organizations and businesses.  Imperial also benefits from 


opportunity to come into our classrooms to receive mentoring and valuable experiences working wi

implementation of the School Improvement Plan, School Safety Plan and school budget. The council consists of parents

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-

32289, a Comprehensive 
Safe School Plan particular to their site. Each school site is required annually, by March 1st, to have reviewed, and if 
necessary, updat
ed their Safe School Plan. Each school forwards its Safe School Plan to the district through the office of 
Student and Community Services. The office of Student and Community Services provides plan development assistance to 
the schools and maintains a file
 
of individual school plans available for inspection by the public. Key elements outlined in 
the plan are: to provide a safe teaching and learning environment; that all students are safe when traveling to and from 
school; that district programs and communi
ty resources are made available to students and parents; and that the school 
provides an environment where everyone effectively communicates in a manner that is respectful to all cultural, racial 
and religious backgrounds.
 
 
A safe and secure learning envir
onment is a priority for Imperial. Emergency evacuation drills are held monthly according 
to education code. The school's PTA purchased equipment and supplies for every classroom for emergency use. Partnered 
with School Messenger, a system is in place that
 
enables administrators to schedule, send and track personalized voice 
messages to their school community for outreach and emergency purposes. In addition, all schools in the district are linked 
through an emergency radio contact system and district radio 
drills are held periodically for preparation in case of 
emergency. The staff and community work together to maintain a safe campus. School
-
wide & classroom incentives 
promote positive attitudes, encourage achievement, and aid in the prevention of behaviora
l problems. In compliance with 
SB187, the safety committee has prepared a "Safe School Plan" which is (on file) in the school office and is available for 
perusal upon request. Imperial Elementary staff works diligently at adhering to the Safe Schools Plan 
developed and 
monitored by the School Site Council.
