By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

SCHOOL DESCRIPTION:
 
Central School is a wonderful neighborhood school of 450 students tucked into the beautiful hills of Belmont where staff 
and parents come together to inspire our 
students to reach their full potential academically, physically, emotionally, 
socially, and morally.
 
 
Overall, Central students perform quite well on the state assessments, with 88% of our students meeting or exceeding 
grade
-
level expectations in both Engl
ish Language Arts and Mathematics. Teachers provide a challenging and engaging 
curriculum, high
-
quality instruction, and an atmosphere that encourages collaborative and innovative learning 
experiences, through which students develop critical thinking skill
s, achieve or surpass the Common Core Standards, and 
develop lifelong learning habits and positive mindsets.
 
 

group of supportive, hard
-
w
orking volunteers. Together we create a community of responsible learners who are inspired 
to be curious, feel empowered to direct their own learning, engaged with their community, and moved to show empathy 
and respect for others.
 
 
Our goal is that all stu
dents will leave Central as independent, successful, lifelong learners, who work to their personal 
best, show perseverance in challenges and positively contribute to our ever
-
changing global community.
 
 
SCHOOL MISSION:
 
At Central Elementary School, we 
strive daily to cultivate a community of responsible learners who feel empowered to 
direct their own learning, are inspired to be curious, engaged with their community, and moved to show empathy and 
respect for others.  We are committed to creating collabo
rative and innovative learning opportunities through which 
students develop critical thinking skills, achieve or surpass the Common Core Standards, and develop positive mindsets 
and lifelong learning habits.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Asse
ssment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] 
and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standar
ds [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State 
University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

InfoSnap section of registration at the beginning of the year. Any changes to parent contacts and emergency contacts 
after school have beg
un to go through the school office by contacting the Administrative Assistant.
 
 
All visitors on campus must sign in to the school office and wear a visitor's tag that is visible by everyone on campus. 
 
 
Disaster Preparedness 
 
 
Central School follows the Emergency Protocols (The Big Five) adopted by the San Mateo County Office of Education.
 
 
Central School utilizes a Disaster Plan to provide a safe environment for students. Our emergency contact list provides us 
with the 
necessary information. We do not release children to anyone whose name is not on the card. We ask parents to 
keep contact information current. If parents wish any daycare providers and caretakers to pick up their child in an 
emergency, they must be listed 
under emergency contacts.

In case of a disaster, all children will follow the emergency protocols for the following: Evacuation, Shelter in Place, 
Duck/Cover/Hold
-
on, Secure Campus, or Lockdown/Barricade. A copy of these protocols can be found in the sch
ool's 
office. Each teacher will stay with his/her class until all parents or designees pick up the children. If safe, we will retur
n to 
the building to wait inside. Otherwise, we will remain outside. 
 
 
No student will be dismissed from school unless a pare
nt (or individual previously designated by a parent) comes for 
him/her. 
 
 
No student will be allowed to leave with another person, even a relative or babysitter unless that particular person is liste
d 
on the student's emergency form in our files. We ask fo
r parent/guardian help in the following areas: 
 

 
Please DO NOT CALL THE SCHOOL. We must have the lines open for emergency calls.
 

 
Directions on where/how to pick up your child will come from district communication via voicemail and/or 
email.
 

 
Park only in des
ignated areas; not on campus. Leave the school's driveway and parking areas clear for 
emergency vehicles.
 

 
At the direction of public officials (fire, police, etc.), the children have been relocated to another site for safety, 
an announcement will be made b
y the district office. A Public Information line will also be maintained at the 
District Office, 637
-
4800, and Blackboard Connect, the school messaging system.
 

 
Students should follow all school district personnel directions.
 

 
If there is a need to evacuate 
the building, students will be on the field behind the school or off
-
site at the 
designated off
-
site location.
 
For your information, we have a complete Emergency Response Plan available in our office. You are welcome to come in 
and review it at any time. 
 
 
Central School 's Safety Committee continually works toward improving student safety. In the past few years, a "Kid's 
Preparedness Kit" concept was developed as a way for parents to participate in preparing our students in the event of a 
natural disaster 
or emergency during school hours. All students bring a completed Emergency Release card, along with 
specific snacks, which are stored by class in the emergency shed. The goal is to provide comfort and sustenance for 
students in a time of an emergency. At t
he end of each year, the students enjoy the snacks at a school

picnic. The committee has also inventoried all items needed in case of an emergency and purchased necessary items. An 
Emergency Preparedness binder for each classroom was dev
eloped for teachers to refer to in case of an emergency. It is 
regularly updated with the most recent emergency procedures. Each classroom also has a First Aid kit, which is used by 
the teacher in case of an emergency. The committee has recently reviewed a
nd edited Central's Disaster Preparedness 
Plan. The Emergency Committee is an integral part of Central's ongoing efforts towards excellence in student safety and 
preparedness.
