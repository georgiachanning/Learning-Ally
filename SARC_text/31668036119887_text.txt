Principal's Message
 
 
Coyote Ridge Elementary provides a creative, innovative and engaging learning environment that 
focuses both on academics, as well as nurturing the social
-
emotional well
-
being of all our students. 
We have b
een proudly serving our school community in West Roseville since August 2002. Coyote 
Ridge was recognized in 2006 as a California Distinguished School and continues to celebrate high 
levels of student achievement, positive learning experiences, as well as 
strong parent and 
community involvement. We are proud of our students and encourage them to be the best they 
can be through our Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS) structure. We explicitly 
teach, model, and practice our four school
-
wide expe

expectations are: Show Respect, Make Good Decisions, Solve Problems, and Be Safe. Students who 
exhibit these expectations are acknowledged through daily PAWS for Praise tickets, as well as 
during our weekly lunchtime ce
lebration. 
 
 
Our student achievement continues to thrive. Staff attributes the gains to our development as a 
Professional Learning Community during early
-
release Mondays, as well as targeted intervention 
for students needing extra support, and use of effec
tive instructional strategies consistently across 
grade levels and content areas. With goals to increase the number of students meeting standards 
each year, we are proud that a large majority of students are meeting standards, as measured by 
both district 
and state summative assessments. 
 
 
Our highly qualified and dedicated staff creates a warm, inviting and child
-
centered learning 
environment. We begin the first day of each school year with a tradition of students bringing a 
flower to their new 
teacher. Using each unique flower, the teacher creates a bouquet which 
represents the diversity and beauty of all students in the class. When you walk onto our campus, 
you feel the welcoming excitement and anticipation of an engaging, respectful and enrich
ing school 
environment. Our teachers work as a professional learning community to ensure all students are 
successful academically, as well as meeting their social
-
emotional needs. 
 
 
We maximize resources with the support of our parents and surrounding comm
unity so that we 
can create enriching opportunities for all students. Our Site Council guides our school improvement 
efforts, while PTA, local businesses, and service clubs support our state
-
of
-
the
-
art digital 
classrooms, technology lab, library, Docent Pr
ograms (e.g. art, music, PE), and science programs. In 
addition to parent and community support, our school offers enrichment clubs which help students 
develop leadership skills and gain a sense of pride and belonging to our school. Some of these 
opportuni
ties include Leaders of the Pack, Cross Country, Conversation Club, Drama, Band, Student 
Council, and Readers and Writer's Club.
 
 
Coyote Ridge offers students an exceptional academic education. New this school year is our 
STEAM Enrichment Academy, serving 
all students in grades 1
-
5. Students have the opportunity to 
select an enrichment class which focuses on: Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, or Math, and 
attend the class on Friday afternoons. We pride ourselves on providing experiences that focus on 
t
he development of the whole child. Our teachers and staff work together to ensure all students 
have the opportunity to succeed.

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Dry Creek Joint Elementary School District held a Public Hearing on September 19, 2019, and de
termined that each school within the District has sufficient 
and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the 
State of California. All 
students, including English learners, are giv
en their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for 
use in the classroom and to take home. In grades 6
-
8 each student receives a textbook available to keep at home and has a class set of textbooks t
o use 
at school. Online access to textbooks is also an available option for mathematics, English Language Arts/English Language Dev
elopment (ELA/ELD), and 
History Social
-
Science in grades kindergarten through eight. Instructional materials are adopted acco
rding to a cycle developed by the State Department 
of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are
 
reviewed by all teachers 
and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a 
selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are 
available for parent examination at each school site, the district office, and in some cases online prior to adoption. The ta
ble displays information about 
the quali
ty, currency, and availability of the standards

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 

  
Regular classroom 
volunteers attend an orientation at the beginning of the year to better 
assist teachers and staff.  The PTA encourages parent volunteers to become 
involved through a variety of activities, including the Art, Music, and PE Docent Programs, Book Fairs, Book Exchanges, and s
everal other activities 
throughout the year.   Senior ci
tizens from our local Sun City Roseville community work with students in the areas of reading and math, and support our 
school library.  Grandparents or special family members are invited to have lunch and attend a Book Fair with their grandchil
d during ou
r annual 
Grandparent's Day event in the Fall.
 
 
Classroom teachers, site administration, and the PTA all actively seek out parents to volunteer.  Parents are encouraged to v
olunteer through notices 
that go home from the PTA and from classroom teachers in th
e beginning of the school year.  The monthly newsletter is used to recruit parent volunteers, 
and teachers also utilize classroom newsletters and back to school presentations to make parent volunteers feel welcome and v
alued.  Volunteers are 
recognized at 
the end of the year at our Volunteer Dessert Tea.
 
 
Parent volunteers may serve on the School Site Council.  As members of the School Site Council, parents work with staff in re
viewing and evaluating 
program effectiveness.  Parents also have the opportunity
 
to be an active participant on the District English Learner Advisory Committee.
 
 
Parents are kept informed of student performance through regular parent teacher contact, which includes parent teacher confer
ences, progress reports 
and report cards via Powe
rSchool, Student Success Team meetings, Individual Education Plan (IEP) meetings, and intervention plan conferences.  Parents
 
of English Learners also receive language acquisition progress through English Language Development profiles.    Classroom ne
wslet
ters include 
information on content and Common Core Standards currently being taught.  Parents receive information about grade level stand
ards at Back to School 
Night, and can access additional information via our school and district websites.  Keeping par
ents informed of student performance is a high priority of 
our staff.

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a top priority at Coyote Ridge Elementary.  All staff had the opportunity to attend specializ
ed training in November 2018 
through DPREP, Inc. (a Disaster Preparation and Critical Incident Response training) to address site
-
s
pecific safety procedures.  Coyote Ridge is in 
compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards.  A School 
Site Vulnerability Assessment 
was conducted on September 8, 2016, to collect data ab
out safety awareness, and recommendations were made as to how to improve the safety of our 
school campus.  The School Site Safety plan was last reviewed and updated on February 12, 2019, by the School Safety Committe
e/School Site Council. 
Any revisions wer

suring the 
safety of students and staff during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a monthly basis throughout the
 
school year.  Comprehensive 
Lockdown and Barricade drills are held three times per year.  Supervision plays an important role in campus safety.  Students
 
are supervised before and 
after school by certificated staff, and classified staff members supervise 
students during lunch. There is a designated area for student drop off and pick 
up. Visitors are required to check
-
in at the school office using the RAPTOR Visitor Management System before entering the school campus, and check 
out when departing.  This web
-
based system is designed for K
-
12 schools and screens out registered sex offenders. This system also allows our staff to 
notify law enforcement in the event of an emergency.
