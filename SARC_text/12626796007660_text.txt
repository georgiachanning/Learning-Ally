School Description
 
Sunny 
Brae Middle School (SBMS) is a 2009 National Blue Ribbon School for 6th through 8th 
students in the Arcata School District. There is one elementary school and one middle school in the 
district with a total population of 525 students. Arcata is a small univ
ersity town located 265 miles 
north of San Francisco on the Northern Coast of California. Arcata is home to Humboldt State 
University and is best known for its redwood trees and university town atmosphere.
 
 
Sunny Brae has an enrollment of 220 students.  Th
e school population draws from a wide range of 
socioeconomic groups, including university faculty, staff, and students; professionals; blue collar 
workers; and artists. The school has approximately 55% of its students on free and/or reduced 
lunch.

support classes.

-

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the f
ollowing information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental 
Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents are invited to visit our school at any time. Parents are encouraged to be involved in all aspects of the school. The 
school has an active School Site 

using our online system 

 
Synergy.   Synergy is our primary website and hosts an array of 
information. Back to School Night, Open House, and 5th Grade Transition Night are evening events that provide parents with in
formation about the 
school.  Additional e
vents are held throughout the school year that provide opportunities for families. Parents are encouraged to be a part of our
 
Athletic 
Boosters, as athletics are a big part oft he SBMS experience.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The Arcata School District has a District Safety Committee to review, update, and monitor
 
school and district safety concerns and procedures. Under the 
leadership of the team, each school maintains a School Safety Plan that deals with disaster preparedness, campus safety, and 
character education. 
Parents, staff, and students are surveyed every
 
third year. The information gathered from the survey helps determine areas that might need to be 
addressed in the school safety plan. The plan is reviewed and updated each year. A copy of the complete plan is available in 
the school office.
 
 
All adults on
 
campus are required to wear an identification badge. Staff members have a picture I.D. that is worn each day. Visitors check 
in at the office 
and wear a visitor badge while on campus. Substitute teachers are issued a badge upon arrival. The badges clearly
 
indicate that individuals have 
permission to be on the school grounds.
 
 
Regular earthquake, fire and lockdown drills are held during the school year. Regular inspections are done by the maintenance
/custodial staff to insure 
that the playgrounds, classroom
s, and school sites are safe and hazard free.
