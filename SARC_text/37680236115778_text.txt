About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For m
ore information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF w
eb 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments

in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co

Parents play a very important role at the Chula Vista Learning Community Charter School.  We 


 
 
We take pride in learning through the expertise parents bring to our school.  We value their commitment to our stude
nts, as well as our school vision.
 
 
Research shows a high correlation between parent involvement and effective schools.  We encourage parents to become actively 
involved in our school.  
We have Parent Information Nights to keep parents informed about asses
sment, curriculum and instruction and we provide parents with ways in which 
they can become partners with us in the education of their children.
 
 
We encourage parents to read to their children at home, provide cultural activities, and attend school functio
ns with their children.  Please contact school 
site secretary if you wish to become involved in school activities, as well as be directed to the appropriate school. English
 
and Spanish translation is

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Each year, targeted professional improvement activities are provided for teachers, instructional aides, and 
other employees.  Activities reflect the school's 
goals and objectives and are part of our Local Educational Agency (LEA) Plan. Staff development topics include:
 
 
Creating Cultures of Thinking (meta
-
cognition); Direct instruction on the delivery of content
 
and language objectives; Observation Protocols ; Integration 
of writing to improve school wide focus on literacy; All new teachers receive professional learning on vision and mission exp
ectations, as well as 
professional learning strategies to engage thin
king and learning.  The Inquiry Model has been implemented to address the California Common Core 
Standards.  In 2017
-
18, teachers will continue processing the inquiry model as well as additional instructional strategies to improve student lea
rning.  The 
Pr
ofessional Development will continue to focus on Professional Learning Communities (PLCs).  Teachers receive feedback through
 
Instructional Rounds.  
In 2018
-
19, faculty will participate in the area of Instructional Rounds and alignment with Teaching for Ef
fective Learning.
 
 
Teachers continue to work on improving instructional units based on student data.  Instructional units focus on grade level c
ommon core standards to 
further support targeted achievement goals.  Through planned professional development da
ys, teachers collaborate with others in sharing teaching 
strategies that promote positive student outcomes.  The implementation of instructional rounds allows for the teaching commun
ity to develop a 
collaborative learning environment and improve student le
arning.
