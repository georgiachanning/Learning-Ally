Description
 
Trinity
 
Center
 
Elementary
 
School
 
is
 
a
 
single-school
 
district
 
located
 
in
 
the
 
rural
 
mountain
 
community
 
of
 
Trinity
 
Center
 
in
 
Trinity
 
County.
 
The
 
three-classroom
 
school
 
serves
 
approximately
 
16
 
students
 
in
 
K-8th
 
grades.
 
The
 
school
 
offers
 
an
 
intensive
 
instruction
 
program
 
for
 
those
 
students
 
who
 
need
 
additional
 
assistance
 
with
 
skills
 
to
 
meet
 
state
 
standards.
 
Physical
 
fitness,
 
drama,
 
art,
 
and
 
music
 
are
 
high-priority
 
subjects.
 
 
 
Our
 
school
 
strives
 
to
 
provide
 
a
 
positive
 
a
 
and
 
supportive
 
environment
 
in
 
which
 
each
 
child
 
can
 
realize
 
his
 
or
 
her
 
social,
 
academic,
 
and
 
physical
 
potential.
 
The
 
multi-graded
 
classrooms
 
provide
 
flexibility
 
in
 
grouping;
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
place
 
to
 
put
 
a
 
student
 
to
 
optimize
 
his
 
or
 
her
 
success.
 
High
 
expectations
 
are
 
set
 
for
 
all
 
students.
 
If
 
a
 
student
 
has
 
difficulty
 
meeting
 
this
 
standard,
 
staff
 
members
 
follow-up
 
with
 
student
 
conferences,
 
parent
 
communication,
 
individualized
 
instruction,
 
and/or
 
extra
 
tutoring.
 
Students
 
who
 
are
 
not
 
meeting
 
grade-level
 
standards
 
are
 
given
 
intensive
 
individual
 
instruction
 
before,
 
during,
 
and
 
after
 
school.
 
Teachers
 
and
 
aides
 
work
 
closely
 
to
 
monitor
 
the
 
progress
 
of
 
our
 
students.
 
 
Our
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
well-rounded
 
learning
 
experience
 
for
 
all
 
students.
 
Toward
 
this
 
goal,
 
we
 
have
 
implemented
 
various
 
programs
 
of
 
instruction
 
including
 
cross-country
 
skiing,
 
ceramics,
 
fine
 
arts,
 
drama,
 
music,
 
instrumental
 
music,
 
and
 
cross-age
 
tutoring.
 
Trinity
 
Center
 
Elementary
 
School
 
staff
 
and
 
community
 
strive
 
to
 
work
 
together
 
to
 
create
 
programs
 
that
 
produce
 
articulate,
 
confident,
 
and
 
skilled
 
students.
 
 
Our
 
vision
 
is
 
that
 
through
 
the
 
united
 
efforts
 
of
 
students,
 
parents,
 
staff,
 
and
 
the
 
community,
 
we
 
will
 
develop
 
students
 
who:
 
Ł
 
value
 
themselves
 
Ł
 
pursue
 
high
 
academic
 
achievement
 
Ł

this
 
vision
 
within
 
a

environment,
 
utilizing
 
a
 
wide

About
 
the
 
SARC
 
By
 
February
 
1
 
of
 
each
 
year,
 
every
 
school
 
in
 
California
 
is
 
required
 
by
 
state
 
law
 
to
 
publish
 
a
 
School
 
Accountability
 
Report
 
Card
 
(SARC).
 
The
 
SARC
 
contains
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
condition
 
and
 
performance
 
of
 
each
 
California
 
public
 
school.
 
Under
 
the
 
Local
 
Control
 
Funding
 
Formula
 
(LCFF)
 
all
 
local
 
educational
 
agencies
 
(LEAs)
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
prepare
 
a
 
Local
 
Control
 
and
 
Accountability
 
Plan
 
(LCAP),
 
which
 
describes
 
how
 
they
 
intend
 
to
 
meet
 
annual
 
school-specific
 
goals
 
for
 
all
 
pupils,
 
with
 
specific
 
activities
 
to
 
address
 
state
 
and
 
local
 
priorities.
 
Additionally,
 
data
 
reported
 
in

School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
Trinity
 
Center
 
School
 
takes
 
student
 
and
 
staff
 
safety
 
very
 
seriously.
  
The
 
Comprehensive
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
is
 
reviewed
 
and
 
updated
 
annually
 
by
 
the
 
safety
 
coordinator
 
and
 
staff.
  
The
 
revised
 
plan
 
is
 
presented
 
to
 
the
 
School
 
Site
 
Council,
 
who
 
serves
 
as
 
the
 
school's
 
safety
 
committee.
  
Upon
 
approval,
 
the
 
plan
 
is
 
then
 
presented
 
to
 
the
 
School
 
Board.
  
This
 
process
 
is
 
completed
 
no
 
later
 
than
 
March
 
1st
 
every
 
school
 
year.
  
Safety
 
topics
 
are
 
discussed
 
at
 
monthly
 
staff
 
meetings,
 
inspections
 
happen
 
regularly
 
throughout
 
the
 
year
 
by
 
various
 
staff
 
members,
 
and
 
additional
 
specific
 
trainings
 
relative
 
to
 
an
 
employee's
 
position
 
are
 
provided
 
by
 
professionals.
  
Regular
 
emergency
 
drills
 
are
 
practiced
 
to
 
ensure
 
students
 
and
 
staff
 
know
 
what
 
to
 
do
 
when
 
a
 
crisis
 
strikes.
  
Along
 
with
 
physical
 
safety,
 
school-connectedness
 
and
 
emotional
 
safety
 
are
 
top
 
priorities.
