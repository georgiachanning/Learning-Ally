By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Heritage Intermediate provides a safe
 
and clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance and 
campus supervision. Original school buildings were constructed in 2002. Ongoing maintenance ensures school facilities 
are kept safe, in good working condition, and continue to pr
ovide adequate space for students and staff.
 
 
Heritage Intermediate is proud of its high standards regarding campus maintenance and general housekeeping practices. 
Staff and students enjoy the benefits of having a well
-
maintained and beautiful campus.

Sch
ool staff and the maintenance department work together to ensure common areas, classrooms, and campus grounds 
are well
-
maintained. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) oversees a work order process enabling school staff to 
communicate unscheduled maintenance n
eeds, urgent repairs, or special projects. The school receptionist prepares and 
submits work orders to M&O for resolution. Emergency situations are given high priority and resolved immediately by site 
or district custodial staff. The principal and day cust
odian communicate daily and sometimes hourly to address campus 
maintenance and safety concerns. The director of maintenance and operations (M&O) meets with site administration 
once a month to discuss maintenance
-
related issues associated with campus upkeep
, safety, classroom space, equipment, 
upcoming events, work orders (submitted and outstanding), and special requests. The director of M&O then meets with 
the custodian to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the school site, and a summary of the inspectio
n findings is 
forwarded to the principal.
 
 
Schools are required by state law to conduct a formal inspection annually of designated areas and systems and then 
prepare a report on the current condition of facilities. The School Site Inspection table illustra
ted in this report identifies 
the state

required inspection areas and discloses the operational status in each of those areas.

chemical usage. Two full

time custodians are responsible for keeping the campus clean and fully operational. The 

des cleaning the staff lounge, stocking student restrooms, and cleaning the cafeteria after 
meals are served. The custodian checks restrooms midday as a proactive measure in keeping facilities stocked, safe, and 
sanitary.
 
 
Every morning before school begin
s, administrators and school staff inspect school facilities for safety hazards and 
maintenance issues that require attention before students arrive on campus. Any graffiti or signs of vandalism are 
removed immediately. A professional janitorial service is
 
responsible for thoroughly cleaning classrooms and restrooms 
during the evenings. The district office dispatches a team of groundskeepers each week to maintain Heritage 

 
 
Etiwanda School District participa

matching funds to assist school districts with major repairs or replacement of existing school building components. These 
repairs typically include roofing, plumbing, hea
ting, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior/exterior painting, and 
floor systems.

State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
