Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in 
which data were collected:
 
August 2019
 
 
Monte Rio Union Elementary held a public hearing, and determined that the school within the district had sufficient and 
good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settle
ment of Williams vs. the 
State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or 
instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks an
d supplementary 
materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making the textbooks 
used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a 
r
ecommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All 
recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. The table displays 
information collected in
 
September, 2019 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a 
primary concern of Monte Rio Elementary. The school is always in compliance with all 
laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The School Site Safety plan 
was last reviewed and updated by the School Site
 
Council, and approved by the Board of Trustees on February 15, 2019. 

includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disas
ter. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a monthly 
basis throughout the school year. Lockdown drills are held twice a year. WE invite local first responders annually to review 
our Safety Plan and Emergency procedures to help insure all agencies are w
orking closely together to protect our students 
and staff should an emergency arise. Students are supervised before and after school and at recess and lunch by 
certificated and classified staff as well as the principal. There are two designated areas for s
tudent drop off and pick up. 
Visitors are required to sign in at the office as soon as they are on campus.
