By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to 
publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to pre
pare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consis
tent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and communi
ty members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dat
aquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school mission statement is: We car
e, We learn, We lead at Hugo Reid.
 
 
Hugo Reid is comprised of two campuses that are both located east of Michillinda Avenue and south of the 210 Foothill 
Freeway in Arcadia, California. Our school sites are four blocks apart but are located in the same sup
portive neighborhood.  
We are nestled in an excellent community of diverse families and friends.  In fact, many of our parents and teachers were 
Hugo Reid Raiders themselves.  Therefore, we have a legacy of high commitment and family involvement since 1949
. The 
primary site completed its final stages of construction in spring of 2015. These enhancements were made possible with 
the passage of Measure I. The elementary site was completed in early October 2014 when the turf field reopened as the 
final phase wi
thin the scope of the project.
 
 
At the school site we offer a variety of activities that are available to students both on a volunteer and try
-
out based 
foundation. Students in grades 2
-
5 can run for Student Council Leadership Team office in the fall and s

Team is an eco
-

footprint. Students in grades 3
-
5 can sign up to participate in the site
-
based competition that is Book Battles.
 
Students in 
this group read a variety of pre
-
selected books and compete internally before the winner takes on those from other AUSD 
elementary school sites.
 
 
AVID, Leader in Me, and Restorative Practices in grades TK
-
5 are core programs and values that he
lp enrich the lives of 
students, teachers, staff, and parents.
 
 
Hugo Reid implements small group targeted assistance for at
-
risk and struggling students. Differentiated instruction occurs 
daily in grades TK
-
5. Hugo Reid supports the implementation of Liter
acy for All and Intervention Programs for targeted 
academic instruction. Based on a variety of assessment results and data collection, students participate daily in small 
group lessons that focus on 21st
-
century skills within the English Language Arts/ Eng
lish Language Development 
Framework.
 
 
Hugo Reid utilizes a site
-
based decision
-
making model that incorporates all the various stakeholder groups on campus. 
There are different pathways and groups involved in decision making that include but not limited to:
 
school leadership 
team, entire faculty, School Site Council, and Parent Teacher Student Association (PTSA). Hugo Reid School finds value in 
stakeholder engagement, and the contributions help to shape a variety of school initiatives. As a school site we ar
e 
continuously posing the question surrounding the approaches for doing what is best for students. In meeting student 
needs, our focus will also be aimed at parent involvement/engagement. A variety of parent workshops, seminars, and 
educational support res
ources will continue as offerings to the parent community. Using results of district surveys and 
input from stakeholder groups, our school site is committed to providing the highest level of programming and 
instructional support to raise academic performan
ce, and provide the social/emotional skill sets necessary for success in 
the 21st century.
 
 
Our Parent Teacher Student Association (PTSA) continues to be a thriving and supportive entity on campus. Through their 
fundraising efforts, the school directly ben
efits from high
-
quality programming, events, and classroom materials. In 
addition to this, our Arcadia Education Foundation provides opportunities for teachers and non
-
administrative staff to 
apply for grants that directly impact classroom instruction.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Ye
ar)
 
 
The Operations Supervisor, in cooperation with the principal, works with the custodial staff of 2 full
-
time and 1
-
part time 
custodian to develop cleaning schedules that ensure a clean and safe school. District maintenance staff members complete 
work 
orders in a timely manner in order to keep the school in good repair. We use a work order process to ensure efficient 
service and highest priority for emergency repairs. The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance 
Budget Program, whi
ch provides state matching funds to assist school districts with expenditures for major repairs or 
replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, 
electrical systems, interior and e
xterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
The passage of a bond measure in November 2006 allowed Hugo Reid to make major structural improvements. The plans 
included building improved library/media center facilities, more student support areas, and updating the
 
office area at 
each campus. Each classroom was enhanced to be a classroom of the future. The district standard includes interactive 
boards, added computers, a high
-
end projector, a document camera, and a sound system. Outdoor lighting, improved 
facility t
echnology, boundary fencing, new signage and restroom facilities were also part of the improvement package.
 
 
Construction began in the 2012/13 school year. Sixteen new temporary classrooms were placed on the playground as 
interim housing for 
existing classrooms. Teachers and students utilized the interim housing while updates were completed 
in the existing classrooms.
 
 
Construction was completed during the 2013/14 school year. The Student Services building was completed late spring 
2015.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information releva
nt to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents and the community are supportive of the educational programs at Hugo Reid School. We encourage participation 

sponsoring/organizing social 
activities for our school such as the Parent Party and Back
-
to
-
School Picnic. The School Site 
Council (SSC) offers an opportunity for community input on the distribution of funds and recommendations for the 
School 
Plan
 
for Student Achievement, which guides
 
our instructional focus. For more information about volunteering at our 
school, please contact the school office.
 
 
Scrip sales, chaired by several parents, provide substantial funding for our school. The chairperson of this effort meets 
with staff to help
 
determine how these funds are used. Outside of PTSA, we have many volunteer opportunities for families 
to give back in the library and classrooms.
 
 
Each year we hold morning and evening meetings to discuss different programs with our parents. We make spec
ial 
accommodations for the parents of our English Learners. The principal, teachers, language translators in Chinese and 
Spanish, and district coordinators attend most meetings to show support and respond to parent concerns. We also use a 
listserv to commu
nicate with all Hugo Reid families. The PTSA helps generate the listserv content using the school calendar 
and general PTSA information. For immediate communication, the Arcadia Educational Foundation (AEF) provides 
monetary support for the ConnectEd commu
nication system. Hugo Reid can send email and/or phone messages 
instantaneously to all parents of Hugo Reid. This form of communication is very effective.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
To safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, a Comprehensive School Safety Plan has been developed by the Safety 
and Disaster Committee, which 
consists of classified staff, teachers, and the principal. The committee sets goals for the 
school to continually improve in 3 areas: School Climate (Students, Parents, and Programs), Emergency Preparedness 
(Disasters and Crisis), and School Environment (F
acilities and Campus). The plan addresses various safety issues, including 
creating procedures that detect and prevent bullying, ensuring appropriate campus supervision, maintaining disaster kits, 
and monitoring emergency procedures. The Comprehensive Scho
ol Safety Plan is updated each year and approved by the 
School Site Council and the Board of Education.  The plan is reviewed with all staff members at the beginning of each 
school year. Safety drills are held on a regular basis; fire drills are held month
ly, earthquake drills are held four times a 
year, and intruder/lockdown drills are held at least once a year. Staff members also receive disaster training on a regular 
basis.
 
 
To ensure student safety, teachers, administrators, and school proctors supervis
e students on campus before and after 
school, and during breaks and lunch. Hugo Reid has a closed campus, and permission is always required to leave school 

ar the proper 
identification badge at all times.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-

Federal Title I funds support after school homework support sessions each week beginning in March every year. After a 
thorough 
analysis of student test data and teacher input, we invite our qualifying students to attend this program to get 
extra help in reading, writing, and math. Most of our general classroom teachers facilitate these sessions. Title II federal 
funds support our 
language arts instructional program during the regular school day using intervention teachers to assist 
in the regular classroom in all grade levels.
 
 
Our dedicated PTSA conducts a variety of fundraisers in support of Hugo Reid, including restaurant nights
, selling first aid 
kits, and candy. Twice each year, our PTSA Gift Committee meets with input from the principal and staff to determine gift 
offers for our school. Some of these funds go to support purchases by teachers, school
-
wide assemblies, and studen
t field 

activities to support civic
-
minded causes, such as camperships and cancer research at local hospitals. Business partners 
through
 
parent employers, the Rotary Club, and the Lions Club also donate funds for designated projects, often related to 
technology or special instructional projects based on teacher grant applications.

Under the current Local Control 
Funding Formula, districts like Arcadia Unified School District, with low numbers of 
unduplicated students receive far less ongoing money to implement the California Academic Standards compared to 


youth).  These high unduplicated count districts receive supplemental and concentration grant monies to purchase 
materials, hire consultants, and pay for hours of professional development for 
their instructional and student support 
staffs.
 
 
In the Fall of 2013, the Arcadia Unified School District negotiated an interest
-
based solution for California Academic 
Standards implementation with its bargaining units to add three days to the school calen
dar for two years starting in the 
2014
-
15 school year. Negotiations produced an agreement to spread the three days of additional paid time over seven 
early release days with development time of 2.5 hours per day built into the schedule.  Since 2015, AUSD l
eadership has 
negotiated annual agreements with its bargaining units to continue the additional three days for professional 
development.

Council (C
-

TAC is a representative group made up of bargaining unit 
members and management team members who were charged with serving as an advisory committee to the District in the 
implementation of the 
district
-
wide California Academic Standards Collaboration Time supporting TK
-
12 instructional 
programs both vertically and horizontally, as they made dramatic instructional and curricular shifts.
 
 
The commitment from both our bargaining units and managemen
t was to build research
-
based professional development 
around small collaborative working groups. Each group would be designed intentionally to have a vertical alignment of 
teachers from TK

In late Spring of 2014, the C
-
TA
C committee reached out to all certificated staff to assist with generating ideas for the 
content of the Collaboration Days. The committee, after reviewing and discussing the many ideas that were submitted 
and looking at survey data, generated a list of th
emes which became the foundation of the Collaboration Days and assisted 
in guiding the development of a Course Group Catalogue. The planning of the Collaboration Days was research based, 
focused on meaningful work, teacher choice, flexibility, and ongoing 
commitment. The Professional Development was 
designed around teacher interests that included creating autonomous choice for teachers and support providers in 
relation to where they felt they could best contribute their training, talents, interests, and edu
cation, by participating in 
Small Working Groups (SWaG) and engaging with other professionals to continue the real work of implementing the 
California Academic Standards.  C
-
TAC continues to act as the advisory body for the Collaboration Days, reviewing su
rvey 
data and requests for course offerings, and considering suggestions for improvements to the program.
 
 
Each SWaG is led by a self
-
selected Facilitator from amongst the various stakeholder groups and has been charged with 
collaborating both with colleag
ues at their own site and with fellow professionals from other district sites. Mentor
-
leaders 
support Facilitators by providing support throughout implementation of this professional development. The crystal
-
clear 
goals of the Collaboration Days include pr
oducing a comprehensive and fully articulated Arcadia California Academic 
Standards Core Curriculum in English
-
Language Arts and Mathematics; to research and make recommendations for 
curriculum and instructional shifts towards a more personalized approach 
to learning in the Social Sciences, Sciences, 
Foreign Languages, Physical Education, Electives, Visual and Performing Arts, Character Education, Technology 
implementation, English
-
Language Development, Next Generation Science Standards implementation, Proj
ect
-
Based 
Learning, Innovative Instruction, Google Classroom and various online and Open Educational Resources, and Special 
Education from a Transitional Kindergarten to Grade 12 perspective. Data continues to be collected from the SWaGs 
through group eval
uations and is then disaggregated and shared through various modalities to each stakeholder group.
 
 
In recent years, additional professional development resources have been designated for Mathematics and English
-
Language curriculum development and 21st Cen
tury instructional skill development, including National Council of 
Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) conferences, Thinking Maps, and Write From the Beginning, in support of California 
Academic Standards implementation, Illuminate data and assessment system, 
AVID, Advanced Placement, and Next 
Generation Science Standards. At the high school level, data indicated that a large segment of potentially college
-
bound 
students were not being provided access and opportunity to pursue honors and college
-
level courses, 
as their high
-
achieving classmates were. Leadership worked with teachers to engage in professional development around the themes 
of Advanced Placement (AP) open access and equity for all students over the past two years. Professional Development 
resources 
have been designated to send teachers, counselors and leadership to the local and regional College Board/A.P. 
Forums. Continued professional development will be pursued at the national level.
 
 
Full implementation of the Advancement Via Individual Determina
tion (AVID) program continues to be a focus of 
professional development dollars over the past seven years.
 
 
Individual school sites have been tasked with working with the Instructional Coaches to conduct professional development 
around the themes of the 
California Academic  Standards, including rigor, focus, coherence, instructional strategies, shifts 
in curriculum, pacing and instructional materials, writing instruction and problem
-
solving.  Arcadia Instructional Coaches 
have become regional professional
 
development leaders by presenting at conferences and through their instituting the 
San Gabriel Valley Instructional Coaches Consortium.
 
 
Staff development topics from  2012

2018 school years have included effective instruction and critical thinking, 
imple
mentation of the electronic grade book, the California Academic Standards, identification, development and curation 
of online resources, pedagogical shifts, brain research and Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Innovative Instruction.
