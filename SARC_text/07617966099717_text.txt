Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned
 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school us
es 
the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the Sta
te of California OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given 
the highest priority. The school personnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of 
Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathem
atics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] 
for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career
 
technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

At Ohlone Elementary, we partner 
with families to support student academic achievement and personal growth.  Ohlone 
publishes bi

Science Collection publications support tips for succes

Ohlone also has a Reading Incentive Program, led by our PTA.  Students are rewarded, monthly, for meeting their reading 
goals and school wide reading targets. We encourage frequent parent communic
ation regarding classroom learning and 
student progress.  We value parents as partners and realize the importance of their input in the educating our students.
 
 
Parents serve as members of the Ohlone School Site Council, English Language Advisory Committee
, and PTA. Parent 
volunteers serve as library assistants, study trip chaperones, student tutors, and classroom parents. Volunteers also help

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of the School Site Safety Plan is to provide a 
unified template for school sites to respond and recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the disruption of normal school operations.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan guides a coordinated school staff response to an emergency, disaster, or ev
ent and aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over time and those that may occur without warning.

Quality instruction and instructional leadership are at the heart of the district's achievement efforts. To ensure this, the 
Academic Support Division engages teachers, administrators and other personnel in ongoing professional development 
focused on impro
ving teaching and learning. Training is provided to principals and other administrators to improve their 
ability to provide strong instructional leadership and guide teaching and learning at school sites. The principals, in turn, 
provide support to teacher
s through staff conferences, opportunities for collaborative study and planning, and individual 
coaching based on ongoing classroom observations. Teachers and other staff are provided with both on and off
-
site 
professional development in all standards base
d curriculum content areas. Beyond the content areas, professional 
development is provided, by teacher leaders, in English Language Development, Gifted and Talented Education (GATE), 
differentiated instruction, Common Core, RTI and educational technology. 
In addition, training is made available in 
classroom management, social
-
emotional learning, and the effective use of assessment data and teacher data teams in 
meeting the needs of all students. A primary goal of the professional development program is ensu
ring that skilled, highly 
qualified teachers serve all students and that teachers are supported by strong, knowledgeable instructional leaders.
 
 
At Ohlone, teachers receive professional development in the areas of Reading Language Arts, Math, Science, and 
other 
areas related to our school
-
wide plan for achievement.  Teachers frequently collaborate with grade level peers for data 
review, instructional planning and lesson design.  Professional Development opportunities, coupled with grade level 
collaboration 
meetings, are key to the ongoing development of our staff and our program.
