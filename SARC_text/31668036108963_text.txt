About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Cont
rol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to addres
s 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Dry Creek Joint Elementary School District held a Public Hearing on September 19, 2019, and determined that each school withi
n the District has sufficient 
and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlem
ent of Williams vs. the State of California. All 
students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for 
use in the classroom and to take home. In grades 6
-
8
 
each student receives a textbook available to keep at home and has a class set of textbooks to use 
at school. Online access to textbooks is also an available option for mathematics, English Language Arts/English Language Dev
elopment (ELA/ELD), and 
History
 
Social
-
Science in grades kindergarten through eight. Instructional materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the State
 
Department 
of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by
 
the State are reviewed by all teachers 
and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recomm
ended materials are 
available for parent examination at each school site, the district offi
ce, and in some cases online prior to adoption. The table displays information about 
the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Heritage Oak was built in 1990. Routine and scheduled maintenance are conducted as needed and per product manufacturers' spec
ifications. Site staff 
typically generates work orders using a web based work order system and they are addressed in an expedient m
anner.
 
 
In 1994, it was named winner of the James D. McConnell Award from the Council of Educational Facility Planners International.
 
The school facilities 
include; a multipurpose room utilized for eating and a variety of school/community functions, a scho
ol library, a computer lab, outdoor amphitheater 
area, and a large playing field that is used by the community for organized sports. School staff, students, the neighborhood 
and community take great 
pride in the facilities, and this is reflected in the cle
anliness and safety record a the school. Parents are supportive of the school
-
wide discipline plan and 
have helped to make the school a safe place for students to attend. Parents and visitors are required to sign in at the front
 
office when coming on campu
s. 
Students are supervised before and after school, and during recess and lunch by school staff.
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. District maintenance ensures tha
t the repairs necessary to keep 
t
he school sites in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure eff
icient service and that 
emergency repairs are give the highest priority.

[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students

the classroom on a daily 
basis. The PTA encourages parent volunteers through a wide variety of activ
ities held during the year.
 
 
Classroom teachers, site administration, and the PTA all actively seek out parent volunteers to support the classroom and sch
ool activities.  Parents are 
encouraged to volunteer through the beginning of the year notices that go
 
home from the PTA and from classroom teachers.  In addition, teachers use 
classroom newsletters and back to school presentations to make parents feel welcome and valued as volunteers in the classroom
s.
 
 
As members of the School Site Council, parents work 
with staff in reviewing assessment data and school planning and evaluation.
 
Parents are involved in the school in a multitude of ways including the following:
 
Volunteering in classrooms and the library
 
School Site Council

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of student
s and staff is a primary concern at Heritage Oak Elementary.  The school is in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulatio
ns 
pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards.  The School Site Safety Plan will be reviewed on February 1
1, 
2020.  All revisions were 
communicated to both the classified and certificated staff.  Safety training is held regularly with school staff to ensure em
ergency preparedness. The 

ff safety during a disaster.  Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a 
monthly basis throughout the school year.  Lockdown/barricade drills are held three times per year.  Earthquake drills are co
nducted twice per year. 
Students are supervised before an
d after school by certificated staff. Classified staff supervise students during lunch.  Classified and certificated staff he
lp 
with supervision during lunch and break periods.  There are designated areas for student drop off and pick up.   We completed
 
a 
site vulnerability 
assessment in September 2018 and are working closely with the district office to make recommended changes to improve overall 
school safety.
 
 
Parents/guardians and interested members of the community are encouraged to visit the school and
 
observe the educational program. Visits during 
school hours should be arranged in advance with the teacher or principal. If a conference with the teacher is desired, an app
ointment should be set with 
the teacher during non
-
instructional time. When school 
is in session, all visitors must go directly to the school office to register before going into 
instructional areas.  (Reference Board Policy 1250, Administrative Regulations 1250(a,b) and Penal code 627.6)
