By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
The Lagunita Elementary School District was established in 1897. The district is a rural, single site school district educati
ng 
students in kindergarten through eighth grades. All classes are taught in self
-
contained classrooms. Our 19/20 enroll
ment 
is 93 students. Additional demographics are shown in the table below.
 
 
Only a small percentage of the student population lives within the district, a sparsely populated rural area. The majority 
of the student population attends on inter
-
district trans
fers from larger districts in the surrounding area. Parents of 
students on transfers from neighboring districts report that they are seeking a smaller school with smaller class sizes. They
 
feel that the multi
-
age classrooms and the sense of community that 
is fostered at Lagunita provide their children with 
optimal opportunities.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
October 2019
 
 
Lagunita Elementary held a Public Hearing during the Fall semester of 2019, and determined that each school within the 
d
istrict has sufficient and good quality textbooks and instructional materials pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. 
the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks 
or instru
ctional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the State Department of Education, making the 
textbooks used in the school the most 
current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers, parents, 
and administrators. All recommended materials are available for
 
parent examination at the district office prior to 
adoption. The table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks 
and other instructional materials used at the school.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

A constructive evaluation process promotes quality instruction and is a fundamental element in a sound educational 
program. Evaluations and formal observations are designed to encourage common goals and to comply with the 

evaluation criteria and district policies. Temporary and probationary teachers are evaluated twice a year.
 
 
Evaluations are conducted by the administrator, who has been trained to perform teacher evaluations. Evaluation criteria 
includes: engaging 
and supporting all students in learning, understanding and organizing subject matter for student 
learning, assessing student learning, creating and maintaining effective environments for student learning, planning 
instruction and designing learning experie
nces for all students, and developing as a professional educator.
 
 
Staff members build teaching skills and concepts by participating in many conferences and workshops throughout the 
year, then sharing their experiences and knowledge with district colleague
s.
 
 
Lagunita School assists students who experience achievement problems, difficulty coping, trouble with decision making, 
or handling peer pressure. Classroom teachers and the School Administrator work individually with students when the 
need arises. In a
ddition to the certificated staff, the classified staff are also available to provide support when needed. The 
classified staff includes two part
-
time instructional aides and a school secretary. The Monterey County Office of Education 
can provide supplemen
tary support staff and services on an as
-
needed basis.
