Description
 
and
 
Mission
 
Statement
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
Suisun
 
Elementary
 
School,
 
a
 
No
 
Excuses
 
University
 
School,
 
is
 
a
 
Transitional
 
Kindergarten
 
(TK)
 
through
 
5th
 
grade
 
school
 
with
 
approximately
 
530
 
students
 
on
 
a
 
traditional
 
schedule.
 
The
 
overarching
 
goal
 
is
 
that
 
every
 
student,
 
without
 
exception
 
and
 
without
 
excuse,
 
will
 
perform
 
at
 
grade
 
level
 
or
 
higher
 
in
 
reading,
 
writing
 
and
 
math
 
while
 
developing
 
and
 
demonstrating
 
positive
 
character.
 
Working
 
through
 
a
 
Multi-Tiered
 
System
 
of
 
Support
 
(MTSS)
 
approach,
 
the
 
school
 
strives
 
to
 
meet
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
each
 
and
 
every
 
student,
 
educating
 
the
 
whole
 
child
 
(academically,
 
social-emotionally,
 
and
 
behaviorally).
 
 
Suisun
 
Elementary
 
is
 
a
 
true
 
community
 
school
 
with
 
an
 
active
 
faculty,
 
PTA,
 
School
 
Site
 
Council,
 
and
 
English
 
Learner
 
Advisory
 
Committee.
 
Students
 
at
 
Suisun
 
Elementary
 
are
 
taught
 
by
 
highly
 
qualified,
 
fully
 
credentialed
 
teachers.
 
The
 
school
 
possess
 
considerable
 
resources
 
in
 
technology
 
to
 
support
 
the
 
instructional
 
practices
 
on
 
campus.
 
Suisun
 
Elementary,
 
also,
 
shares
 
the
 
facility
 
and
 
resources
 
of
 
the
 
Suisun
 
City
 
Library.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
only
 
partnership
 
of
 
its
 
kind
 
in
 
Solano
 
County.
  
The
 
school
 
believes
 
in
 
the
 
power
 
of
 
partnership
 
between
 
the
 
surrounding
 
community,
 
parents/families,
 
teachers,
 
and
 
students
 
as
 
they
 
are
 
all
 
working
 
toward
 
a
 
common
 
goal
 
to
 
develop
 
knowledgeable,
 
confident
 
and
 
responsible
 
students.
 
The
 
school
 
believes
 
communication
 
and
 
understanding
 
are
 
the
 
cornerstones
 
to
 
education.
 
This
 
focus
 
on
 
communication
 
includes
 
reading,
 
writing,
 
listening
 
and
 
speaking,
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
recognize
 
and
 
express
 
opinions
 
and
 
feelings,
 
and
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
peacefully
 
solve
 
problems.
 
 
The
 
School
 
Mission
 
is
 
as
 
follows:
 
"Everyone
 
involved
 
at
 
Suisun
 
Elementary
 
believes
 
the
 
academic
 
potential
 
of
 
each
 
student
 
is
 
tremendous.
 
We
 
believe
 
all
 
children
 
can
 
learn,
 
and
 
that
 
it
 
is
 
our
 
responsibility
 
to
 
educate
 
and
 
nurture
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
the
 
whole
 
child.
 
We
 
understand
 
difficult
 
challenges
 
may
 
confront
 
some
 
students,
 
and
 
thus
 
we
 
are
 
committed
 
to
 
providing
 
a
 
safe
 
learning
 
environment
 
that
 
knows
 
no
 
limits
 
to
 
the
 
academic
 
success
 
of
 
each
 
student.
 
As
 
such,
 
we
 
strive
 
each
 
and
 
every
 
day
 
to
 
meet
 
the
 
social,
 
emotional,
 
behavioral,
 
and
 
academic
 
needs
 
of
 
all
 
students."
 
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
school-wide
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
six
 
character
 
traits
 
of
 
trustworthiness,
 
respect,
 
responsibility,
 
fairness,
 
caring
 
and
 
citizenship.
 
The
 
character
 
education
 
program
 
focuses
 
on
 
teaching
 
empathy,
 
impulse
 
control,
 
anger
 
management
 
and
 
problem
 
solving.
 
The
 
school's
 
mantra
 
is
 
ﬁWe
 
work
 
hard
 
every
 
day
 
because
 
we
 
are
 
college
 
bound!ﬂ
  
The
 
school
 
believes
 
in
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
the
 
social-emotional
 
well-being
 
of
 
all
 
students
 
and
 
the
 
impact
 
this
 
has
 
on
 
positive
 
school
 
culture.
 
Thus,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
strong
 
focus
 
on
 
Positive
 
Behavioral
 
Interventions
 
and
 
Supports
 
(PBIS).
 
The
 
students
 
and
 
staff
 
work
 
everyday
 
to
 
model,
 
promote,
 
and
 
reinforce
 
the
 
three
 
basic
 
school
 
rules,
 
Strive
 
for
 
Excellence,
 
Express
 
Kindness,
 
and
 
Solve
 
Problems,
 
also
 
known
 
as
 
"The
 
SES
 
Way".
 
In
 
order
 
to
 
carry
 
out
 
this
 
work
 
in
 
an
 
open,
 
caring,
 
and
 
understanding
 
environment,
 
the
 
school
 
prides
 
itself
 
on
 
being
 
a
 
Trauma-Sensitive
 
school.
 
Suisun
 
Elementary
 
school
 
sees
 
the
 
potential
 
in
 
every
 
child,
 
and
 
believes
 
in
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
fostering
 
resilient
 
learners.

The

requires
 
safety
 
plans
 
for
 
each
 
school:
 
BP/AR

BP3515,

The
 
Governing
 
Board
 
insists
 
that
 
students
 
and
 
staff
 
have
 
the
 
right
 
to
 
a
 
safe
 
and
 
secure
 
campus
 
where
 
they
 
are
 
free
 
from
 
physical
 
and
 
psychological
 
harm.
 
The
 
Board
 
is
 
fully
 
committed
 
to
 
maximizing
 
school
 
safety
 
and
 
to
 
creating
 
a
 
positive

environment
 
that
 
teaches
 
violence
 
prevention
 
and
 
emphasizes
 
high
 
expectations
 
for
 
student
 
achievement,
 
responsible
 
behavior
 
and
 
respect
 
for
 
others.
 
Each
 
school
 
site
 
develops
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
school
 
wide
 
safety
 
plan
 
that
 
includes
 
violence
 
prevention
 
strategies
 
and
 
actions
 
to
 
be
 
taken
 
in
 
the
 
event
 
of
 
a
 
crisis.
 
Each
 
plan
 
is
 
tailored
 
to
 
the
 
specific
 
conditions
 
at
 
the
 
school.
 
Each
 
school
 
plan
 
takes
 
into

the
 
expertise,
 
available
 
resources
 
and
 
building
 
design,
 
along
 
with
 
factors

The
 
number
 
of
 
school
 
days
 
listed
 
above
 
for
 
staff
 
development
 
and
 
continuous
 
improvement,
 
only
 
include
 
those
 
days
 
that
 
were
 
offered
 
on
 
formal
 
agendas
 
for
 
all
 
staff.
  
However,
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
those
 
days,
 
staff
 
were
 
offered
 
additional
 
opportunities
 
to
 
attend
 
trainings
 
both
 
on
 
and
 
off
 
site,
 
including
 
a
 
Trauma
 
Informed
 
Practices
 
series
 
provided
 
by
 
the
 
Solano
 
County
 
Office
 
of
 
Education,
 
conferences
 
and
 
institutes
 
provided
 
by
 
NEU
 
on
 
site-wide
 
leadership
 
and
 
how
 
to
 
maintain
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
success
 
for
 
all
 
students,
 
MTSS
 
conferences
 
and
 
training
 
sessions,
 
and
 
more.
  
Furthermore,
 
site
 
staff
 
(including
 
the
 
Principal,
 
Teacher
 
of
 
Academic
 
Support,
 
MTSS
 
Team
 
Members,
 
Mental
 
Health
 
staff,
 
and
 
more)
 
provide
 
coaching,
 
mentoring,
 
and
 
professional
 
development
 
on
 
a
 
voluntary
 
basis.
  
Teachers
 
and
 
staff
 
can
 
attend
 
offered
 
sessions
 
and/or
 
schedule
 
one-to-one
 
and
 
group
 
times
 
with
 
these
 
support
 
staff
 
members.
 
 
Teachers
 
are
 
offered
 
a
 
tiered
 
approach
 
of
 
support
 
based
 
on
 
their
 
individual
 
needs.
  
Topics
 
for
 
professional
 
development
 
for
 
the
 
whole
 
are
 
determined
 
based
 
on
 
district
 
initiatives/focus,
 
school-wide
 
data,
 
and
 
staff
 
feedback.
  
Topics
 
for
 
individualized
 
support
 
are
 
determined
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
manner,
 
with
 
additional
 
emphasis
 
on
 
staff
 
requests.
  
Due
 
to
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
success
 
experienced
 
utilizing
 
the
 
coaching/individualized
 
approach,
 
much
 
of
 
the
 
focus
 
for
 
teacher
 
support
 
is
 
provided
 
in
 
this
 
manner,
 
but
 
is
 
not
 
included
 
in
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
days
 
listed
 
above.
  
Though
 
traditional
 
types
 
of
 
professional
 
development
 
do
 
have
 
some
 
positive
 
impact
 
on
 
student
 
success,
 
at
 
Suisun
 
Elementary
 
they
 
have
 
found
 
that
 
ongoing,
 
targeted
 
support
 
for
 
staff,
 
including
 
coaching
 
and
 
mentoring,
 
provided
 
by
 
on-site
 
staff,
 
has
 
proved
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
most
 
positive
 
impact.
