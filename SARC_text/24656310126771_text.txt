By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Bellevue Senior Elementary School is a 7
-
8 school serving approximately 200 students. It is located in the community of 
Atwater just off Highway 99. It is one of ten schools in the Atwater Elementary School District.
 
 
Many
 
of our students are learning English as a second language, therefore teaching reading and promoting the use of 
academic language is a high priority. Bellevue prides itself on its high standards of success for all students.
 
 
As part of the Atwater Elementa
ry School District, Bellevue School is committed to providing a high quality academic core 

and that prepares each student to become a pr
oductive and responsible citizen.
 
 
Students who are identified as needing remediation and additional support in English Language Arts and Math are targeted 
for academic intervention.   The administrative staff and school leadership team closely monitor the
 
implementation and 
effectiveness of the academic program by reviewing student work, observing teaching practices, analyzing assessment 
data, and providing direct feedback to staff, students and parents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Bellevue Senior shares a campus with Bellevue E
lementary.  All together there are 35 classrooms, one library, one building 
for support personnel, one cafeteria and kitchen facility, and one office complex. Four custodians clean these facilities and
 
restrooms daily and handle minor repairs. Sixteen prim
ary classrooms have undergone major remodeling and a new fire 
alarm and intrusion system were installed.
 
 
During the summer of 2005, Bellevue School received modernization in the intermediate classrooms (4th
-
6th grades) 
located on campus, the school office
, and in bathrooms in order to be ADA compliant. At this time a school
-
wide expansion 
project brought an additional kindergarten building (which houses four classrooms), a new library, and six middle school 
classrooms were added.  A second project 

 
re
-
fig
uring the school parking lot, also completed in August of 2005, ensures 
a safer driveway, parking areas and bus loading zones for students, parents and staff.
 
 
A new school gym was built in the summer of 2012 and the installation of a centralized/computeri
zed centrally controlled 
HVAC system was installed alongside with upgraded light fixtures to improve energy efficiency at the end of the 2013 
school year.  During the summer of 2014 a new roof was built in sixth wing.  At the start of the 2016 school year 
a new 
school track was completed.
 
 
The main school parking lot was again reconfigured in 2018 to improve traffic flow.  New roofing was completed on the 
kindergarten and intermediate wing classrooms in the summer of 2019 as a part of the district 
maintenance plan.  These 
projects ensure the school provides safe, clean and adequate facilities.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
o
f study.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There are 
continuing opportunities for parent involvement at Bellevue School, offered in both English and Spanish. Our 
School Site Council, which includes membership of staff and parents, oversees and develops the 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement. The English Lan
guage Advisory Council provides parents of English Learners a format for input and 
participation. Another committee with parent membership includes our parent volunteers, that work closely with our 
Student Leadership Team.  We offer Parent Knowledge Nights
, Family Movie Nights, and other family events to encourage 
participation and involvement in school activities.  Parents volunteer regularly at the school in classrooms, the library, or
 
other school
-
organized events.  In collaboration with outside organiza
tions we offer many opportunities including but not 
limited to parent literacy, healthy dietary habits, and parenting approaches related to supporting educational progress.
 
 
Community volunteers are available to provide assistance both in and out of the cl
assroom which include parents, high 
school volunteers, Rotary members; local businesses may support by providing volunteers or motivational materials for 
students; the City of Atwater has supported by maintaining common walls (graffiti abatement) and the u
se of city parks 
and recreation facilities for school use.  Two Community Outreach Coordinators are specifically assigned to the site to 
support family and community members.
