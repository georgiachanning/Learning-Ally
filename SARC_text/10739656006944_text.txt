School Description
 
 
MISSION:
 
To Learn, To Lead, and Leave a Legacy.
 
 
VISION:
 
In partnership with parents and the community, the vision of our school is to 
prepare leaders. At 
McKinley we recognize, honor and celebrate the leaders within us.
 
 
McKinley Elementary School has a large Title 1/English Learner student population. McKinley 
Elementary focuses on developing the whole child by teaching students leaders
hip principles to 
build student's self
-
confidence, interpersonal skills and 21st Century global competence. McKinley 
is the only school in Central Unified McKinley to implement a Leadership process called the "Leader 
in Me". McKinley is a walk
-
in school an
d all those that attend live within a mile radius thus making 
the school the hub of the community.  Just west of McKinley Elementary on the same parcel of land 
is El Capitan Middle School.  The two schools work together to provide community support for the
 
families of Central Unified by holding a variety of parent workshops and classes along with sharing 
both campuses with one other for various events as well as provide cross
-
age tutoring for the 
McKinley students.
 
 
McKinley School serves 783 
students: 67% are Hispanic/Latino; 5.2% are White; 8% are African
-
American; 14% are Asian/American; 1% are Filipino/American; 5% (other Multiracial, Pacific 
Islander, American Indian).
 
 
The two academic goals in English Language Arts (ELA) are to increase 
the percent of students 
meeting or exceeding California State Standards as measured by Statewide and local assessment 
by one year's worth of growth and to increase EL student performance, one band, on the ELPAC.  
The goal in Math is for all students is to 
increase the percentage of meeting or exceeding California 
State Standards as measured by Statewide and local assessments. Results from the 2018
-
19 Parent 
Survey and the LCAP survey of parents, staff, and students show growth in all survey dimensions in 
Pa
rent Communication, Quality Instruction, and School Climate.  McKinley is committed to 
continuing to increase parent involvement by partnering with PTA, Learning Partners, and outside 
agencies to provide parent workshops. Progress indicators for academic p
erformance include the 
SBAC assessment, local benchmark assessments, and CCSS common grade
-
level assessments, 
Fountas and Pinnell Assessments, STAR, and ST Math progress, all of which are aligned to grade
-
level CCSS. Scores are in the district's data colle
ction program that is updated regularly, and 
teachers and staff have access to for monitoring and making the correct instructional decisions for 
grouping and interventions for students not making adequate progress.
 
 
The McKinley staff is committed to 
empowering all students with the knowledge, regardless of 
primary language, natural abilities, or ethnicity. 81% of our students come from families that are 
economically disadvantaged and have few educational resources at home to support learning. 
McKinley
 
has 8.5% Special Needs students  87.7% At
-
Risk/Title I students;  18% ELLs; 3% GATE 
students; and 2 Migrant students. The school's ELA academic focus is on reading comprehension 
and reading fluency through the dimensions of the CCSS Framework.  The school
 
focuses on 
teaching math through the 8 Standard Math Practices to promote critical thinking, conceptual 
understanding, and problem
-
solving in all content areas.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
dist
rict office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Central Unified Schools maintain current and standards
-
aligned instructional materials in good repai
r, for all students. Materials are locally adopted and 
reflect programs currently approved by the State Board of Education. All materials currently adopted reflect the most recent 
SBE adoptions and support 
the current California Frameworks.
 
 
Every student,
 
including English Learners, Special Education, and other special populations have their own textbook. In the case of class se
ts, those sets 
augment individual texts that have been issued to individual students. These class sets are made based on a commitm
ent of the district administration 
and the governing board and are not the product of any state requirement.
 
 
All instructional materials are subject to a school and district review process. Materials may be piloted and all materials t
hat are 
selected and 
recommended for local adoption are reviewed by teachers, administration, and any parents who wish to review the materials. Th
e Central Unified Board 
of Trustees reviews and adopt based on the recommendation of the district adoption committees 
and Educational Services.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
McKinley sits on 10.6 acres and 64,807 square feet. It contains 37 classrooms at 35,908 sq ft, and 14 restrooms at 1,269 sq f
t. The oldest main building 
was built in 1961. The table below shows the results of the sch
ool's most recent inspection using the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT).  This inspection 
determines the school facility's good repair status. District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep the sc
hool in good repair and work 
orders are com
pleted in a timely manner.  For all items inspected that were found to not be in 'good repair', work orders have been created
 
and 
maintenance will be done before the end of the 2019
-
20 school year.  Maintenance items will be prioritized so that student saf
ety is not compromised. 
The overall rating for this school is 'fair'.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

McKinley Elementary School is committed to high quality and on
-
going professional development for all teachers and support staff. Professional 
development is provided at both the 
district and site.  The school facilitates and supports 45
-
minute Professional Learning Community (PLC)  collaborative 
meetings twice a week in order for teachers in all grades to analyze, discuss, and utilize the results of common assessments,
 
district be
nchmarks, and 
state assessments to guide instruction, instructional planning, and student placement. Every other week teachers attend staff
 
development on minimum 
days after school based on the district and school site goals.
 
 
Due to the shifts in ELA and 
Math CCSS and the results of the SBAC, McKinley has focused professional development for teachers from 17
-
18, 18
-
19, and 
19
-
20 school years to specific training in ELA instructional shifts, the teaching of reading through guided reading, literature 
circles
, and close reading 
strategies. In Math, the staff was introduced to the 8 Math Practices, teaching for conceptual knowledge, as well as best pra
ctices to teach procedural 
lessons. In addition, teachers were provided professional development for English le
arners and the ELD standards in integrated and designated settings.  
In 18
-
19 and 19
-
20 the PD focus shifted to specifically train teachers on strategies of Academic Conversations using Academic language and ac
countable 
talk.  Specifically the structure an
d intent of the academic conversations.  Teachers are also receiving on
-
going training and support at both the site and 
District level in the implementation of Common Core State Standards and Authentic Performance Based Tasks, as well as utilizi
ng technolo
gy within the 
classroom.  A specific calendar outlining goals and objectives is provided to teachers each year.
 
 
During the  2016
-
2017 school year, the McKinley staff received training over the summer on The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People to go with 
a
 
school
-
wide process called The Leader in Me. The 7 Habits training was selected because there was an identified need to develop stud
ent efficacy and motivation. 
A grant from Franklin Foundation has enabled McKinley to able to teach the whole child social 
and emotional needs that had been lacking.  Students are 
learning how to become a leader of their learning and to take ownership of their education which in turn builds their esteem 
and self
-
worth. In 2017
-
2018 McKinley staff aligned the 7 Habits to goal s
etting.  Students, classes, grade levels and teachers all set goals that aligned to the school
-
wide goals to 
increase academic achievement. Students led the parent
-
teacher conference by presenting their goals and Leadership Notebooks.  During the 2018
-
2019
 
McKinley continues to weave the principles of the 7 Habits through the Empowering Instruction professional development that i
s based on the work of 
Marzano, Hattie, DuFour, Fisher, and Fry.  The end goal is to teach students the skills they need to be suc
cessful for college, career, and community for 
the 21st Century. During 2019
-
2020 McKinley will incorporate the 7 Habits into the new Social Emotional Learning  curriculum adoption, by asking the 
question, "How does this concept relate to the 7 Habits?"
 
 
T
he staff received training during 2016
-
2017 on Visible Learning.  Administration and team of teachers received several days of training based on John 

 
that emphasized Learning Outcomes and 
Success Criteria in ELA and Math.  In addition to the continued work of the aforementioned, McKinley will continue the Visibl
e Learning work by including 
effective feedback for the 2017
-
2018 school year.  In the last 
three years, the percentage of proficiency for McKinley has significantly increased in ELA 
and math on the SBAC, there is still a need for students to develop skills in critical thinking, communication, and problem
-
solving. The 2018
-
2019 and 
2019
-
2020 acad
emic focus is to develop skills related to academic discourse in all subject areas.  Teachers 3
-
6 are involved in a lesson study in math.
