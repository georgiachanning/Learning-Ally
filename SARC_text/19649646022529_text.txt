By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The mission of William L. Valentine Elementary School, in par
tnership with parents and community, is to provide students 
with an academically focused program in a positive and caring learning environment. Using broad
-
based curriculum and 
support programs, we strive to empower our students for future success by provi
ding student self
-
worth, social 
responsibility, and respect for individual differences.
 
 
With a population of 590 students, Valentine Elementary School maintains a challenging educational program that is 
closely matched with the developmental stages and ed
ucational needs of the children. Instruction is grounded in rigorous 
content and performance standards and curriculum that go far beyond the basics.  Students become competent in using 
the tools of critical thinking and communication as they learn to becom
e literate seekers of knowledge, effective users of 
ideas, information, communication, and problem
-
solving.  These skills are applied in core content areas including 
reading/English
-
language arts, mathematics, social studies, science, visual and performing
 
arts, and health/physical 
education. Well
-
trained professionals effectively use high
-
quality instructional tools, including readily available 
technology. Good citizenship and personal accountability for behavior are an integrated part of every activity.
 
 
Valentine Elementary School was recognized as a recipient of the 2015 National Blue Ribbon School Award. Our school 
community is very proud of the hard work of our students, staff, and parents that contributed to this award for 
Outstanding Academic Achieve
ment. All students have equal access to the core and co
-
curriculum. Those with special 
needs (including English learners, learning disabled) receive specialized support, both in the mainstream and special 
programs, that is designed to access the core curri
culum in ways that best suit individual learning styles and needs. 
Interesting and creative teaching and learning occur in a safe environment where positive attitudes and behavior are 
expected and achieved.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Valentine Elementary School facilities are clean, saf
e, and functional.  No Williams Complaints have been filed. A School 
Facility Conditions Evaluation is done each year by the Director of Maintenance and Operations. A copy of the latest Facility
 
Inspection Tool (FIT) can be found at https://goo.gl/SMtg2j. 
An evaluation of all schools facilities conditions is completed 
annually in the fall. Facilities Inspection Tool is an annually required inspection and is intended to report on the existing
 
conditions of various aspect of our school facilities. This is not
 
a tool intended to evaluate equipment. This doesn't reflect 
repair costs, equipment efficiency, or the frequency of repair since the previous year's FIT. This is a snapshot in time 
evaluating a predetermined list of the facility equipment and conditions. 
This inspection is not designed to use as a capital 
improvement tool.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
On the 
whole, our students are academically focused and thus, there are very few discipline problems.  Open and honest 
relationships among teachers, children, parents, and administration are a solid foundation for a safe school environment.

A Comprehensive Schoo
l Safety Plan is monitored and updated as appropriate by a representative team of school, parents, 
and community members including a law enforcement representative.  The plan is updated each year by our School Site 
Council with input from our Staff Safety 
Committee. We have integrated technology into our safety plan and continue to 
upgrade our facilities. Components required by Education Code 52012 and 52842 address the following goals:
 
 
Goal #1:  All students and staff members are provided a safe teaching 
and learning environment.
 
Goal #2:  All students are safe and secure while at school, when traveling to and from school, and when traveling to and 
from school
-
related activities.
 
Goal #3:  District programs and approved community resources are made availab
le to students and parents.
 
Goal #4:  Students, parents, staff, and community members shall effectively communicate in a manner that is respectful 
to all cultural, racial, and religious backgrounds.
 
 
Our school counselor coordinates the 
implementation of the Second Step Program in all classrooms TK
-
5th grade. Our 
school counselor teaches Second Step lessons in every classroom every week. Parents receive an email after every lesson 
with information on the strategies their children are lear
ning. Students are participating in MindYeti this year to develop 
skills to maintain focus, learn calming strategies & regulate emotions. Staff, students, and parents use common language 
to describe social and emotional skills, challenges & areas of growth
.

The San Marino Unified School District students 
outperform their grade level peers throughout the state on nearly all 
indicators reported on the California School Dashboard (https://www.caschooldashboard.org/). However, professional 
development primary/major areas of focus have been developed through a 
review of that data along with other locally 
collected data, site and district level needs assessments, and engagement with the community. Eight (8) teachers from 
each school site were sent to the two
-
day UDL Boot Camp for Teachers, Presented by Dr. James 
Mckenna at the West San 
Gabriel Valley (WSGV) Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA). This two
-
day in
-
person workshop is designed to provide 
teachers with a clear understanding of why Universal Design for Learning is essential, how it incorporates resea
rch in 
learning and motivation, and what the actual framework entails. Participants will engage in a collaborative examination 
of lessons to identify UDL in action and generate opportunities for further implementation. Furthermore, these same 
teachers were
 
sent to a two day follow up UDL Implementation Academy where they learned about the phases of UDL 
implementation, determine where the organization is in the implementation process, and create a plan for moving 
forward. Participants workshopped ideas recei
ved and provided feedback, and identified the next steps in the UDL 
journey. Teachers in this session explored the systems and infrastructure that support UDL implementation, practiced 
protocols that support the scaling of UDL, determined areas for growth 
in your own setting, set short
-
term and long
-
term 
goals, and designed an implementation plan. Additionally, one (1) to two (2) representatives from each school site were 
sent to SPORT2 Suicide Prevention Training with the Los Angeles County Office of Educa
tion (LACOE) and the Department 
of Mental Health (DMH) to learn more about aligning district practices and policies with AB2246, Multi
-
Tiered System of 
Support (MTSS), and Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS). Moreover, those same staff mem
bers were 
sent to a four (4) day Foundations of a Multi
-
Tiered System of Support (MTSS) training to learn how to develop a 
framework for providing tiered teaching and interventions around academic, behavior and social
-
emotional supports that 
address the ne
eds of ALL students. The District team aligned the system of initiatives, supports, and resources, organize 
and plan our MTSS efforts and began to plan the continuous improvement processes at all levels of the system to meet 
the needs of the whole child.
