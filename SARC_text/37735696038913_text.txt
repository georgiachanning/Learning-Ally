School Description
 
Santa Margarita School is a place where all students succeed. We have grown from an 
underperforming school in 1999 to a California Distinguished School in 2004 and a National Blue 
Ribbon School in 2006. In 2005 we were also named a Title I Academic School.
 
Because we serve a 
large military community, our student mobility and multiple deployment rates are high. We focus 
on assessing new students promptly and place them in instructional programs that will meet their 
needs, providing extra support as necessary
.
 
 
In addition to all this, our school buildings and beautiful campus create a welcoming environment 
for all students and staff.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publis
h a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a
 
Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent w
ith data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abou
t the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal 
or the 
district office.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter B
alanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible stud
ents 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: 
Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
O
pportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We have many ways for parents to participate at our school. Parents can join our School Site Council, which helps to oversee 
the implementation of our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement and stimu
lates academic improvement. Our PTSA helps our school by funding student field trips, family events, and 
instructional materials. Teachers welcome classroom volunteers to help with projects in the classroom. Our library tech welco
mes volunteers to help in 
the library as well.
 
 
We currently offer several unique family nights (Tech NIght, Meet and Greet, Back to School Night and Family support), includ
ing others sponsored by 
the Military Child Education Coalition.  The contact person for parent involvement is
 
Kathy Shippen, who can be reached at (760) 901

School Safety Plan
 
Students attend a monthly school
-
wide assembly to help build a culture of caring and respect. We recite our Mustang Pledge of Allegiance each morning 

ion to our school, Lunch Recess Options provides 
smaller group supervised indoor recreational activity choices. Our students help new students feel welcomed, and this gives t
hem the opportunity to 
take on a leadership role.  Our discipline policy focuses o
n educating children to make safe and respectful choices.
 
 
We hold a series of School Safety Meetings which bring staff, students, and parents together to discuss the safety climate on
 
our campus. Students are 
given the opportunity to share their thoughts 
on bullying, staff interaction, and feeling safe and nurtured. This team also reviews the results of the annual 
California Healthy Kids Survey.
 
 
Every October we have at least one school
-
wide lockdown drill to assess staff and student knowledge and our abi
lity to create a safe harbor in a short 
amount of time. We then continue to hold announced drills each month to establish a safety mindset.
