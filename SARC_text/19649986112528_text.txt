School Description
 
Located amongst the mountaintops of the Santa Clarita Valley, Mountainview Elementary School, 
home to approximately 860 students and a staff of about 100 adults, embraces high academic and 
behavior expectations which are taught, encourag
ed, and recognized alongside a civic learning 

Learning and Leadership focus.  Focusing on both academic and social areas for success, our focus 
incorporates 
such powerful components as peer tutoring, buddy classes, a student run valet, 
student run game table, student service, sixth grade leadership, peer mentoring, library assistants 

in each of these 
subprograms, students and teachers provide service to other peers and classrooms in addition to 
supporting and facilitating the community spirit Mountainview hopes to exemplify.  In the 
classroom, teachers provide whole group lessons, smal
l group English Language Development 
lessons, small group intervention for those in need, as well as extension opportunities for those 
working at and above grade level. This differentiation meets students at their current instructional 
level and continues 
to set high expectations for students to reach or exceed the standard.  Parents 
are encouraged and welcomed as classroom volunteers, presenters at our school
-
wide Career Day, 
field trip chaperones, Junior Achievement instructors, School Site Council repres
entatives and 
active members of our PTA.  A strong bond is nurtured between student, staff and parent 
community evidenced by the relationships observed in the classroom, out of the classroom and 
within the community at large.  Integrating these together en
courages all students to engage 
actively in the school, build positive relationships, and apply this learning to social responsibility 
within our school and community.
 
 
Our Vision: Developing the Hearts and Minds of Every Child
 
 
Our Values: Integrity~Commi
tment~Compassion~Learning~Creativity~Innovation

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Since 1988, California has sought to provide intensive learning experiences for beginning teachers.  To provide an effective 
transition into the teaching 
career for first
-
year and 
second
-
year teachers, several programs have been developed statewide and are in use in our district.  The Beginning Teacher 
Induction Program extends individual training and support in the practice of teaching.  Additionally, we have a Peer Assistan
ce and 
Review (PAR) program 
to extend assistance and support to credentialed teachers newly hired who may need support transitioning into our school dist
rict.
 
 
Professional growth activities are planned annually based on current needs and input received from staf

two professional development days that focus on continued implementing of benchmarks and ingoing progress monitoring with the
 
online components 
of our English Language Arts curriculum, Next Gen Math for ou
r mathematics program and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).   Additional 
opportunities have also been provided regarding technology integration with our interactive flat panels (IFP), Special Educat
ion needs, Teachers on 
Special Assignment (TOSA) w
orkshops, and planning time within grade level teams to implement the State Standards.  Staff development during Tuesday 
staff meetings primarily focuses on continued implementation of effective instructional strategies, and continued lesson deve
lopment to
 
help students 
master state standards in English Language Arts (ELA) and mathematics.  We continue to implement 30 minutes of designated ELD
 
instruction daily as 
well as integrated support for ELD students during other content instruction, provide Interven
tion for struggling students in core content areas, and to 
target listening and speaking standards. Collaborative Planning time continues to be made available by early release days on 
designated Wednesdays 
and 3 full days of planning throughout the school 
year allowing teachers the time to plan together within and across grade levels focused on increasing 
student achievement.
