School Description
 
Junction City School is a 2018 Distinguished School and Exemplary District!
 
 
We are a small, 
one
-
school district serving about 80 kids in grades TK
-
8. We are located in the small 
mountain town of Junction City in Trinity County, California. We are nestled at the base of the 
beautiful Trinity Alps Wilderness, along ten acres of the Trinity River.
 
 
Our staff and community strive to work together to create programs that produce articulate, 
confident, and skilled students. There is a strong focus on a well
-
balanced education for every 
student with high standards aimed at excellence and student empowerm
ent.
 
 
All Junction City School students participate in a curriculum that is based on Common Core 
Standards and is enriched with STEM, Social Emotional Learning (SEL), and Visual and Performing 
Arts. Our After School Program offers electives, academic enric
hment, and homework assistance. 
Our intervention program offers support for students that need additional assistance with skills.
 
 
The mission of Junction City School is to improve the academic and social skills of all students, and 
to create a school clim
ate conducive to learning by encouraging good citizenship, good attendance, 
and high academic standards. It is our intent to provide an environment that fosters in children the 
ability to recognize and accept responsibility to the end that they may be acti
ve participants in our 
global society.
 
 
Together, these programs and philosophies help to promote a whole school family atmosphere 
with an emphasis on our students' success and well
-
being.
 
 
We are excited about our dynamic learning community, and look forw
ard to sharing it with you!

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Junction City School was built in 1990.  There
 
are four classrooms, a STEM lab, a very large resource room, office, and a staff room in the main building. 
Our gym/cafeteria and kitchen are separate from the main building. The after

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education populati
on and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

that satisfy the
 
requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
The content of professional development is based on school 
needs and student achievement. The primary focus of professional development is on 
implementing a standards
-
based curriculum, and data
-
driven assessment. Professional development also includes strengthening subject matter expertise 
and classroom management
 
as well as implementation of technology into the classroom. New teachers or teachers new to a grade level are carefully 
selected and supported during their first years of teaching. Professional development is provided for teachers in multi
-
graded and redu
ced
-
sized classes. 
Most teachers serve on committees within the school, such as the School Site Council, MTSS Team, and Student Study Team. Teac
hers and administrators 
are involved in the overall operation of the school. There are opportunities for teacher
s to work and plan collaboratively and to share information. 
Teachers and instructional aides are encouraged to take advantage of professional development opportunities in the district, 
county, regional, and state 
levels. Opportunities are provided at staf
f meetings to share what they have learned from their professional development. Staff development related to 
special needs students reflects the demographics of the school.

Types of Services Funded
 
Junction City School strives to serve the needs of all students.  We offer all students academic support and intervention dur
ing our After School Program.  
All 
students are also offered social/emotional support by our school counselor, and through our Social Emotional Learning (SEL) c
lasses that are integrated 
into all classrooms. Although we do not qualify for Title 1, because of the inaccurate census data colle
cted in small rural areas, we ensure that all of our 
disadvantaged youth are provided with the support that they need to be successful.
