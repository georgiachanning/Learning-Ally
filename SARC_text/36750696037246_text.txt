The vision statement of Upland 

The professional teaching staff at Magnolia is dedicated to the implementation of this vision within 
all area of learning in the school community. The staff values high expectations and 
high 
achievement, the integrity of character, collaboration, and innovation. In addition, the leadership 
and staff recruit support from community and parent volunteers as they actively work toward 
implementing this goal.
 
 
School leadership and the communit
y of stakeholders are committed to providing a learning 
environment that actively engages both students and teachers in a challenging program that leads 
to academic success. It is our goal to establish a learning environment in which all students can be 
su
ccessful in meeting rigorous academic and behavioral standards at high levels. We have 
internalized the belief that all students can achieve at high standards and work as a Professional 
Learning Community to make this a reality.
 
 
There is sufficient eviden
ce that the staff makes this vision a reality on an on
-
going basis. The staff 
has high expectations for all students and uses a variety of research
-
based instructional strategies 
to help students attain mastery of academic standards. Instructional programs
 
include 22 regular 
education classes, 3 SDC classes, Resource Specialist Program, Speech and Language Specialists, 
school psychologist, librarian, and instructional aides. Magnolia's success is evident when one 
reviews the CAASPP results which indicate th
at 68% of students in grades 3
-
6 met or exceeded 
standards in English Language Arts; while 63% of students in grades 3
-
6 met or exceeded standards 
in math. Magnolia has twice been named a California Distinguished School and continues to make 
great strides 
in the implementation of the new Common Core State Standards. Magnolia teachers 
and paraprofessionals have many opportunities to enhance their instructional practices by 
attending a variety of professional development activities which most recently have in
cluded 
Cooperative Learning using Kagan Structures, a variety of workshops that have focused on Common 
Core State Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, Positive Behavior Intervention Supports 
(PBIS), AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination),
 
Thinking Maps, Daily 5, Google Summit, 
21st Century instructional strategies, and a vast number of learning opportunities through Upland 
University. In support of these instructional programs, students have access to a library and 21st 
Century Classrooms 
that are equipped with 1:1 student Chromebooks, LCD projector, document 
camera, and Interwrite Board.

School Description (continued)
 
Magnolia involves family and community members in 
understanding the common core standards, supporting the 
curriculum and 
instruction, and updating them on achievement 
data. Messaging system, homework websites (School Loop), 
District and school websites, and daily student planners are utilized 
to effectively communicate with Magnolia families and the 
community throughout the 
year. The commitment of our 
community is evidenced by excellent attendance at Back
-

School leadership and the community of stakeholders are 
committed to providing a learning environment that actively 
engages both students and teachers in a challenging program that 
leads to academic success. It is our goal 
to maintain a learning 
environment in which all students can be successful in meeting 
rigorous academic and behavioral standards at high levels. 
Everyone at Magnolia is committed to the belief that all students 
can and will achieve at high levels, and it i
s this heroic commitment 
that demands energy and enthusiasm from each and every staff 
member of Magnolia Elementary School.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability R
eport Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accounta
bility Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SA
RC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the
 
CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Invo
lvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The feeling of energy, enthusiasm, and commitment begins with our Magnolia staff but gains momentum with our school community
. Magnolia School 
ensures that every student has equal access to quality education in an optimal, saf
e learning environment. We also recognize that the success of each 
student is dependent on the successful partnership between home and school. Therefore, Magnolia school provides open and freq
uent communication 
and partnership between students, parents, an
d the local community.
 
 
Our volunteer program is critical to the success of meeting the differentiated needs of our students. We have a variety of vo
lunteers, trained by teachers, 
to ensure proper support. In addition to classroom volunteers, our library f
requently uses parent volunteers to support literacy on campus.  The Magnolia 
PTA oversees room parent volunteers,event volunteers, and yearbook volunteers. Another critical volunteer program on the Magn
olia campus is our 
Watchdog Dad's program.  Through t
his program we have Dads on campus almost daily helping with arrival, dismissal, recesses and lunch sport activities.
 
 
One of our proudest community projects at Magnolia has been the creation and nurturing of our school gardens. These gardens i
nclude raise
d beds for 
a Peter Rabbit garden and California Timeline garden with native California plants, walking paths, and a pond
-
less waterfall to recreate the regions of our 
great state. We have expanded our gardens with the addition of an Upland Heritage garden 
(local citrus fruit trees), a State Flower garden (flowering 
plants from around the United States), a Colonial Herb garden, and an Ancient Civilization garden. We lovingly refer to these
 
areas of our school as our 

 
Garden Club was reinstated which is run by staff and several dedicated parent volunteers allowing our students 
who participate to learn about growing produce.
 
 
A discussion of parent involvement would not be complete without describing the commitment of o
ur PTA. Like the staff of Magnolia School, PTA expends 
many hours to nurture our successful educational environment. The commitment of our community is evidenced by excellent atten
dance at special 
events, such as Back to School Night, Open House, Family Fu
n Night, parent education nights, family dine out nights, special events  and book fairs. Our 
parent
-
teacher conferences have traditionally boasted over 90% attendance.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Clima
te (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
One of the characteristics of an 
effective school is a safe and orderly campus. Our Comprehensive School Safety Plan and Emergency Preparedness Plan 
are developed by school representatives and is reviewed and updated yearly in the fall of each year. Both plans are reviewed 
regularly and a
djustments 
shared and implemented with all staff at monthly meetings. Specific safety objectives are practiced to mastery through monthl
y school
-
wide drills. 
Objectives for drills include student behavior and procedures, attendance, lock
-
down protocols and
 
procedures, and search and sweep procedures.
 
 
Each year revisions and modifications are made to improve safety. District, and site funds provide resources to organize and 
maintain classroom safety 
backpacks, equipment, and storage. An important feature of
 
our safety focus is that Magnolia maintains a secure campus with locked gates and adult 
supervision before and after school on the playground, cafeteria, at crosswalks, and at student drop
-
off and student pick

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The Upland Unified School District believes that high quality, research
-
based professional development is essential to continuous improvement of 
teaching skills and concepts. The District provides or coordinates on
-
going training based on needs identified 
through student performance indicators, 
including results of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, the English Language Proficiency Assessme
nts for California, District 
iReady benchmark assessments, and input from sites regarding s
pecific needs. Professional development is aligned with the District Strategic Plan for 
Student Achievement and Board goals. Teachers, paraprofessionals and administrators participate in workshops, and conferences
 
that allow them to 
grow professionally and
 
provide opportunities for collegial sharing. Regular meetings of teacher leaders in literacy, mathematics, reading interventi
on 
and technology as well as follow
-
up coaching support full implementation of training. Additionally, each school provides time f
or teacher collaboration 
on student achievement data, curriculum development, and review of classroom
-
based performance measures. Examples of workshops and coaching 
implemented as the result of analysis of student achievement include: Effective Teaching St
rategies, Classroom Management, Curriculum Alignment and
