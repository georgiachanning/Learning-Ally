Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and communit
y members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and 
other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation
, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Riverbend Elementary opened in the fall of 2007 as a K
-
6 school and expanded to K
-
8 in 2009. Riverbend is unique to our 
community, as it offers students a K
-
8 experience, but at the same time has a 6
-
8 component that is large enough to offer 
the
 
multitude of programs that one usually can only find at larger middle schools. The vision for Riverbend Elementary is 
for our students to become critical and creative learners and thinkers and independent problem solvers. They will 
demonstrate the charact
eristics of competent, responsible, and caring citizens, and acquire the academic and 
communication skills necessary for contribution and success within a diverse global society. The Riverbend staff, students, 
and parents take great pride in our school and
 
are fully committed to making our vision a reality.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative 
Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participa
te in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students w
ho have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The Riverbend Elementary School Parent Club Committee meets on the second Thursday of every month and provides 
support for staff and students through fundraising and event planning. Parents also serve on
 
our School Site Council and 
guide the development and implementation of our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement. We have English Language 
Advisory Committee (ELAC) meetings five times a year that assist with keeping our parents of English Language Learners 
informed and involved with their child's education. Many Riverbend parents volunteer t
o assist teachers in the classroom, 
help in the library, or assist the office staff. All parents are encouraged to be involved in the school and take an integral
 
role in the education of their children.

-
20)
 
 
The Safety Plan stresses the procedures for ensuring student safety during emergencies. Riverbend 
students and staff 
train monthly for emergencies through evacuation and lock
-
down drills. The safety plan includes procedures to handle 
accidents, chemical spills, bomb threats, bad weather emergencies, floods, earthquakes, fire, evacuation, and 
intruder/l
ockdowns. All staff members have a copy and the plan is reviewed on a regular basis.  The School Safety Plan 
was updated in August 2019.
