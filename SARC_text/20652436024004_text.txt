About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Avai
lability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Madera Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018, and determined that each school within the district had sufficien
t and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or s
cience lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in t
he classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the
 
state are reviewed by all teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.
 
 
The table displays information collected in October, 2018 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other 
instructional materials used at the school.

maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessar
y to keep the school in good repair and work orders are completed in a timely manner. A work order 
process is used to ensure efficient service and highest priority is given to emergency repairs.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
 
The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist school 
districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically this i
ncludes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., Calif
ornia Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
