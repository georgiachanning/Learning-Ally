By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

oom, 
a computer lab, a library, and an administration building.

given the highest priority.
 
 
Providing a clean learning environment is a District priority. The principal  works with the custodial staff to develop 
cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe schoo
l.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
The per pupil expenditure from the General Fund 
supports the basic educational program of the District. At Mary Lou 
Dieterich Elementary School, this is essentially the cost involved in providing staff, textbooks, supplies, and equipment for
 
all pupils. Special services, such as those provided for Engli
sh Learners (EL), are funded by monies that are received by the 
District exclusively for that particular special service.
 
 
In addition, Mary Lou Dieterich Elementary School received School Based Coordinated Program (SBCP) funds to provide 
services to all p
upils. A School Site Council, composed of staff and parents elected by their respective peers, is authorized 
by the Governing Board to oversee this program. Supplemental services (additional personnel, materials and equipment) 
to help Limited English Profi
cient pupils acquire English were funded through Federal Title three funds.
 
 
Each year, because of fundraising efforts and high parental involvement, fundraising efforts through the Associated 
Student Body and an organized parent support group also provide
 
funding for student educational activities including 
assemblies and field trips.
 
 
At Mary Lou Dieterich Elementary School, we offer intervention services during the day, as well as three days per week 
intervention services after school.

Mary Lou Dieterich Elementary School classroom 
teachers and other school personnel participated in a variety of staff 
development activities. The principal meets with all teachers during staff meetings throughout the school year and in PLC 
meetings weekly. The principal also meets with each grade level
 
team during Academic Conferences to evaluate student 
assessment data and intervention groupings and to create strategies to improve instruction to meet students' specific 
academic needs.
 
 
The district holds Professional Development days and teachers are g
iven Professional Development training at the school 
site via teachers who are on the district curriculum councils and have attended district level training. The focus of these 
in
-
service days has been varied, but has included topics such as: Cyber securit
y for students, Social and Emotional well 
being of students, Explicit Direct Instruction, Depth of Knowledge, Rigor, Learning Objectives, Response to Intervention, 
NGSS, Social Studies Framework, and Checking for Understanding.  The district has provided t
rainings on Professional 
Learning Communities and building Impact Teams as well.  There were also developments of ELA and Math Benchmarks 
that focus on the Common Core standards.

Stanislaus Union School District has provided summer activities including a "Tech Fest" focused on helping teachers 
navigate the ever
-
changing technology available to educators.  Mar
y Lou Dieterich Elementary was also supported in 
sending a team to the annual PLC conference in 2017, and has begun training in Positive Behavioral Interventions and 
Supports, PBIS (2017
-
Present).  Furthermore, the district has supported the administration
 
in attending ACSA workshops 
focused on Curriculum and leadership as well as Equity Leadership.  The principal then returns with information and 
deeper training for the staff.
 
 
During the 2017
-
2018 and 2018
-
2019 academic years, off
-
site training opportunit
ies for teachers have also begun to focus 
on teaching to the whole child with consideration for adverse childhood experiences, the effects of trauma, mindfulness, 
and how to best discipline in a restorative and proactive manner.  This shift has occurred du
e to an observed need to teach 
civility and conflict resolution to our students.
 
 
During the 2016
-
2017 and 2017
-
2018 School years, teachers and administration have begun training on the ELPAC 
assessment and procedures for English Learners.
 
 
Beginning in the
 
2018
-
2019 school year, and continuing into future academic years, Mary Lou Dieterich Elementary has 
determined three areas of need  for all professional development that is provided through site Title 2 funding.  Teachers 
are training in GLAD strategies a
nd instructional needs of English Learners, including ELPAC preparation training.  
Additionally, there is a second focus to provide a high level of viable curriculum through teacher planning and 
collaboration.  To provide this, we have focused on professio
nal developments related to Achievement teams and 
enhancing curriculum.  Finally, we are continuing to send teachers and staff to training related to trauma informed 
teaching and social
-
emotional learning.
 
 
The district and the school administrator look at
 
student assessment data to determine the needs for the types of 
Professional Development across the district and at the school site. Professional Development is also delivered through 
individual mentoring, one to one support from the district Teachers on 
Special Assignment, and through the New Teacher 
Induction program.
