School Description
 
The mission of the Lancaster School District, a group of dedicated and caring professionals, is, with 
the support of the community, to develop academic and personal excellence in all students through 
a rigorous curriculum infused with high expectations wit
hin a safe and secure environment 
fostering socially responsible citizens who enrich our diverse community.
 
 
The Lancaster School District has adopted a strategic plan, founded on 10 core beliefs, that 
articulates our commitment to providing a quality educ
ation for all children. The following 
strategies define our objectives in four key areas that we believe are critical components to 
excellence in education:
 
 
Strategy 1: Academic Rigor 

 
We will assure effective implementation of the standards
-
based 
curric
ulum throughout our district and use assessment data and collaboration to drive research
-
based instructional practices to ensure academic growth, proficiency, and the narrowing of the 
achievement gap.
 
 
Strategy 2: Safe Environment 

 
We will provide a safe 
and secure environment within structurally 
sound and aesthetically pleasing facilities.
 
 
Strategy 3: Community Partnership 

 
We work to ensure every student makes progress in achieving 
our mission and objectives through a collaboration of neighborhood scho
ols, families, staff, city 
and our business community.
 
 
Strategy 4: Personal Excellence and Social Responsibility 

 
We will promote social responsibility by 
developing cultural competence and personal integrity, specifically teaching, modeling and 
assessin
g throughout the learning environment in partnership with students, families, staff, and 
community.
 
 
School Vision Statement: Our school motto. Striving for Excellence Through Personal Responsibility, 
is a vision that is shared by members of the school com
munity.  It plays an integral role in the entire 
school program. Using a standards based system for learning and behavior in partnership with 
parents and community, students are encouraged to pursue excellence in education and social 
development.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned I
mprovements (Most Recent Year)
 
General
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the Los Angeles County Office of Educa
tion. The results of this survey are available at the school office or at the district office.
 
 
School Buildings
 
Endeavour Middle School was established on a temporary site in 2004 and moved into our newly completed facilities in December
 
2007. Our main 
bu

 
classrooms, 9 are permanent 
and 34 are relocatable, as well as 1 computer lab.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff 
ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process a
nd Schedule
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is 
available at the district office. 
The Supervisor of Operations works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning
 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
Although the State no longer requires a Deferred Maintenance contribution, Lancaster School District is still dedicated to ma
intaining the facilities for 
our students.  These expenditures would include but not be limited to roofing, plumbing, heating, air 
conditioning, electrical, painting, and flooring.  For 
the 2019
-
20 school year, the district has budgeted $940,000 for deferred maintenance projects.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Project
 
We completed a new activity room in 2019.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summ
ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number 
of students who participated in both assessments.
