School Description
 
At Jack Northrop Elementary School, our 
mission is to support all students as they develop their 
abilities, talents, and academic and life skills.  As a center of learning, we will:  "Educate Students 
Today to Explore Tomorrow."
 
 
At Jack Northrop Elementary School, professionalism is embedded at
 
our site and is evident in the 
means with which our students succeed academically.  We have adopted rigorous curriculum goals 
that include an emphasis on all students receiving the core curriculum.  In addition to our core 
curriculum, our students have ac
cess to the most recently adopted textbooks, an automated 
library, and a wealth of computer technology.  An after
-
school program (Lancaster CARES) is offered 
in partnership with the City of Lancaster to support students with homework and enrichment 
activit
ies. Students are exposed to the community through field trips and assemblies offered 
throughout the year. The students are also able to access our most valuable resource, a talented 
and energetic staff. We work on a continual basis to enhance our communit
y and parent 
involvement within our school.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
General
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, t
he district uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the Los Angeles County Office of Education. The results of this survey are available at the school office or at 
the district office.
 
 
School Buildings
 
Jack Northrop was built on a temporary site in
 
1991 and moved to their current permanent site in 2004. Our main building houses the front, health, and 

ooms

19 are permanent and 
18 are re
-
locatable 

 
and a computer lab.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure eff
icient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is 
available at the district 
office. 
The Supervisor of Operations works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe sc
hool.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
Although the State no longer requires a Deferred Maintenance contribution, 
Lancaster School District is still dedicated to maintaining the facilities for 
our students.  These expenditures would include but not be limited to roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrica
l, painting, and flooring.  For 
the 2019
-
20 school y
ear, the district has budgeted $940,000 for deferred maintenance projects.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the Californi
a Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate ac
hievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the 
requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the
