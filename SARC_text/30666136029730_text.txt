By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Response to Intervention model to best meet their needs.  Students are provided instruction on p
ositive character traits 
and expected to follow "The Westmont Way" a comprehensive behavioral support program that teaches students to "Be 
Respectful, Be Responsible, and Be Safe."
 
 
Westmont's Mission Statement is that students will become:
 
1) self
-
actuali
zed learners who have mastered a challenging core curriculum and believe themselves to be capable, 
significant, and able to mold their own future as they reflect on their personal accomplishments and direct their own 
thinking;
 
2) skillful communicators who
 
are able to readily acquire and effectively express information, ideas, and emotions through 
reading, writing, speaking, listening, and the use of technology;
 
3) problem
-
solvers who are able to generate practical and innovative solutions to complex intell
ectual and social problems 
using critical and creative problem solving skills; and
 
4) socially conscientious citizens who are responsible for their own behavior, are able to work collaboratively, demonstrate 
honesty, empathy, fairness, and respect for othe
rs, as contributing citizens in their ever
-
expanding world.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
In November of 2016, the Ocean View School District (OVSD) passed Measure R, a general obligation bond, in the amount 
of 169 million dollars. This is the 
first bond ever passed in the 143 year history of OVSD. The bond program is designed to 
transform the aging fleet of 1960/1970 era schools into modern, contemporary learning environments. Construction 
started in late June of 2018 and is anticipated to take
 
approximately eight years to complete ending somewhere in the 
2024/2025 school year.
 
 
The District currently embraces a systematic approach to maintaining the current facilities to ensure that all schools are 
clean, safe, and provide an inspirational educ
ational environment for our students to learn, grow, and be challenged. 
District maintenance and site custodial staff work in a coordinated manner to ensure that the repairs and operational 
items necessary to keep the schools in good condition are complete
d in a timely manner. A comprehensive work order 
system is utilized by school and District staff to communicate both routine and non
-
routine maintenance requests. 
Emergency repairs are given the highest priority. 
 
 
From an operational perspective, the cust
odian inspects the facilities for safety hazards or other conditions that need 
attention prior to students and staff entering school grounds. One full
-
time day custodian and one or two part
-
time 
evening custodian(s) are assigned to each school site. The da
y custodian is responsible for:
 

 
Lunch area setup/cleanup
 

 
General grounds maintenance

through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the admini
stration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successf
ully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

The days represented above only represent opportunities that ALL teachers participate in throughout the year. District 
committee work or content area teams training are not calculated in the total 
above. Elementary has 2 non
-
student days 
of training, 1 day of site
-
based foundational skills training, and 1.5 days to analyze data and develop an action plan totaling 
4.5 days for ALL elementary teachers. Middle School also has the 2 non

student days and
 
the 1.5 data days totaling 3.5 
days for ALL middle school teachers.
 
There are two non
-
student days included in the District calendar that focus on professional learning each year. At 
elementary sites Wednesdays are modified days. Students are released ear
ly to allow time for teachers to focus on 
professional learning, collaboration, and planning. Two Wednesdays a month are devoted to professional learning and 
collaboration and the other two Wednesdays are for collaboration and teacher planning. Middle Scho
ol will have 10 early 
release Thursdays starting in the 2019
-
2020 school year to allow for professional learning, collaboration, and planning as 
well. There are also 1.5 days allotted to each school site to review data and create planned actions based on t
he data. 
Other professional learning opportunities are made available for teachers who are representing their school and bringing 
back information and professional learning provided for school site administrators to bring back and share with staff.
 
Ocean V
iew School District has a Roadmap that is collaboratively developed with stakeholders. This Roadmap defines the 
professional development needs of the students and staff across the district. It is also used to develop the Local Control 
Accountability Plan (
LCAP) and School Plans (SPSA). The focus for the professional learning in TK
-
5 schools has been on 
Foundational Skills for Literacy, Diagnostic assessments to inform instruction, and using a toolkit of resources to 
differentiate instruction for all student
s. In middle school the focus has been on developing and implementing new 
integrated science units, writing in science, and training teachers to conduct a History
-
Social Science pilot of instructional 
materials. All schools have been working on Social
-
Emot
ional learning, Positive Behavior Instructional Support (PBIS), and 
some of the schools have been trained in restorative practices. Throughout the year, teaching staff are provided the 
opportunity to participate in District
-
sponsored staff development work
shops or training sessions as
 
1) a supplement to site
-
based staff development,
 
2) for reinforcement of or follow
-
up on previous training, or
 
3) follow
-
up training for newly implemented programs/curricula.
