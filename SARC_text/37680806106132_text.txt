Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019

La Costa Heights Elementary is located in northern San Diego 
County in the city of Carlsbad. We are one of nine elementary 
schools in the Encinitas Union School District. La Costa Heights Elementary School is a 2018 Civic Award of Merit, 2016 
California Gold Ribbon School and 2014 California Distinguished School ser

kindergarten through six.
 
 
We offer a full academic program for our students. At La Costa Heights we believe all students are leaders and live by our 
mission: Inspiring learners, empowering leaders. Our rigorous cu
rriculum and enrichment opportunities sustain us in 
fulfilling this mission. The school has developed educational programs designed to provide the skills and tools necessary 
for students to explore their creativity while developing a strong educational bas
e in an ever changing global society. 
Children explore and demonstrate their abilities through challenging academic activities as well as creative art, music, PE, 
multimedia, and drama experiences. The teachers and staff are dedicated to ensuring the acade
mic success of every 
student and providing a safe and productive learning experience.
 
 



and encouraging their child to meet them through the completion of homework and participation in home activities. Our 
parents are also active participants at La Costa Heights through a vari
ety of volunteer opportunities. It is our goal that 
through understanding and communication we can develop a rapport that results in the best educational environment 
possible for our students. Our success is largely dependent on how effectively we can work
 
together as a team to meet 
the needs of our students.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
La Costa Heights Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. School facilities 
were built in 1987, a
nd currently include a multipurpose room, staff lounge, 24 permanent classrooms, playground, and 
media center. We also have modular buildings with 12 classrooms accommodate current and future growth. The asphalt 
was recently resurfaced in 2015. New landsca
ping has also been recently also added to the parking lot median and the 
garden spaces around the school. Beautification projects such as painted and tile murals enhance the campus. In 2016 
new student furniture was purchased and solar panels were installe
d at La Costa Heights.
 
 
District maintenance supervisors are proactive and conduct inspections at school sites on a continual basis. Repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order proces
s is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. District maintenance has 
indicated that 100% of all toilets on school grounds are in working order. Bathrooms are available in designated classrooms 
to accommo
date students with special needs.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Maintaining a safe and orderly environment is essential to learning. The Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP) is 
developed by La Costa Heights Elementary in consultation with 
local law enforcement/Emergency Preparedness staff, 
School Site Council (SSC) and Administrative Services in order to comply with Senate Bill 187. It was most recently updated 
and reviewed in September 2019 and accepted by the Board of Trustees in November
 
2019.
 
 
The CSSP includes elements such as emergency plans and procedures, including the Run, Hide, Fight Model, the School 
Protection Evacuation Plan for Wildfire, school rules and school dress codes. Fire drills are conducted monthly, earthquake 
drills a
re held four times a year, and two lockdown exercise drills are practiced each year. All schools in the district are 
closed campuses, and visitors must immediately register in the school office before entering the campus. School access is 
monitored by admi
nistrators, teachers and other school staff.
