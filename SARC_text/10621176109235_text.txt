About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to pub
lish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepar
e a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consisten
t with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardi
ans and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Pinedale Elementary School was built in 1953, making it 65 years old. We provide a clean, safe learning environment. Our cust
odial staff of one plant 
supervisor and two evening custodians perform basic
 
cleaning operations in every classroom on a daily basis. In addition, deep cleaning is conducted two 
times a year. Our SART committee conducts eight clean
-
campus inspections each year. This committee of parents inspects the campus grounds and 
restrooms on
 
a regular basis to provide feedback to our student body. When asked to grade how well the buildings and grounds are maintaine
d at their 

 
 
Through increased community awarenes
s, pride and an open
-
campus policy, we hope to keep vandalism and burglary to an all
-
time low. Students are 
encouraged to participate in keeping the campus clean and to take personal responsibility for a beautiful learning environmen
t.
 
 
With the use of 19 
regular classrooms and nine portables, we comfortably house and provide instruction for our 550 students. Pinedale has the ca
pacity 
to hold 600 students.
 
 
Philosophically, the district believes schools are the hub of their neighborhoods. As a result, a hig
h priority is placed on building and maintaining excellent 
facilities as economically as possible.
 
 
Voters within the CUSD approved Measure A on March 2, 2004. This bond measure of $168 million was combined with state bond fu
nds and developer 
fees to produ

hool and 
intermediate school, three new elementary schools, and the purchase of one additional elementary school site. Building add
itions, remodels and site 
improvements took place at all district schools. In addition to new construction, modernization and renovation projects are u
nderway at several of our 
older school facilities.
 
 
In 1998, all facilities were reconstructed, and a Lib
rary Media Center (LMC) with a computer lab was added. During the summer of 2007, staff restrooms 
were remodeled, new windows installed, and all the classroom furniture was replaced. We also installed SMARTBoards, document 
cameras and LCD 
projectors in all
 
classrooms in grades K
-
6. New playground equipment was purchased during the 2007
-
08 school year, new carpet was installed during 
the summer of 2009 and our school was repainted during the summer of 2010. New lighting, cabinets, tile and fixtures were ins
t
alled as well.
 
 
In 2014, construction was completed on brand
-
new kindergarten classrooms and a new multipurpose room for the Pinedale campus. Plans are being 
developed to modernize the office and library as well for future projects.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities);

Categorical Aid Programs commonly called CARS. The application is submitted in two (2) parts:  Part I, which contains program
 
and demographic 
information, is submitted by June 1 each
 
year; and Part II, which contains the budget information and additional program data, is submitted by January 
31 each year.  The categorical programs included in the application are Title I, Part A

ds are designed to assist students in mastering state 
standards.
 
 
Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community.  CU
SD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive 

education will not only bring success to your child but other children in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in
 
the lives of Cl
ovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending
 
on the type of categorical 
funding a site may receive, district or school parent councils and committees are required 
under certain requirements and guidelines.  Such advisory 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee (DAC) and School Advisory Committee (SAC)
 

 
District Learner Advisory Co

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent co
mmittees that assist with categorical programs and funding.
 
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
ts, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is respo
nsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
School
 
Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.

District Advisory Committee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC 
acts as the SAC. The SAC serves as an advisory committee 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and
 
site level.  These education programs are supplemental education opportunities that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  The SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Educat
ion Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are required to form an ELAC. T
he ELAC is composed of 
parents and school 
personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding services for English l
earners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Wheneve
r there are 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a DELAC representative and arra
nge to have that 
representative attend ev
ery DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/guardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) e
lected to s
erve as the DELAC 

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meets four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and
 
other needs related to the student achievement of our students, community agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan Native students in grades
 
K 
-
 
12. The program 
assists eligible stude
nts to achieve at the same challenging state performance standards expected of all students in grades pre
-
K

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP annually that works to better align the academic plan
 
with the distric
t 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to 
participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participation of school and district committee meetings and community forums. 
 
LCAP School, District Meetings and 
Community Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share 
their ideas on how CUSD 
can provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and school


 
 

ort youth and families and to 
provide input and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to sha
re new ideas to support 
identified groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The fo
llowing is an overview of the categorical funding and programs in CUSD.  These funds are further discussed and outlined in ea

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 

iculum program.  Some children have special characteristics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economically disadvantaged ho
mes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lac
k English language proficiency because they have a primary language other than English.  Children, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally provided through the base/core curriculum program.
  
The needs of our
 
children are identified and supplemental services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Catego
rical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support to meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of high quality learning opportunities and access to the co
re curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additional assistance to help students succeed in
 
the regular classroom program (base/core curriculum) 
and address any learning gaps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff dev
elopment.   Staff development 
activities are used to improve instructional pr
actices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other staff to challenge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
