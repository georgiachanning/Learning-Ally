By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The District takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the Dis
trict 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. Safety 
inspe
ctions take place on a quarterly basis at all sites.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep the school maintained and in working order are 
completed in a timely manner. An electronic work order process is
 
used to ensure timely and efficient service. Emergency 
repairs have highest priority. A maintenance worker is assigned to the site, and is usually on campus once every week. No 
emergency repair needs exist at this site.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education populati
on and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the re
quirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Thomas Edison staff recognizes the importance of parent collaboration to support student achievement. Parents are 
welcome to come to Edison to participate in our school wide events, volunteer, meet with teachers, and participate in 
our various parent educa
tion offerings. We provide several parent education sessions throughout the year that focus on 
nutrition, positive discipline,anti
-
bullying policies, academics, and communicating with school staff. We have multiple 
Coffee With the Principals, Padres en Acc

In addition, our PTA and 
SSC/ELAC meetings are open to the community and all are encouraged to attend and provide staff with feedback. We

Most recent review date: 12/14/2018
 
 

Risk Management Office who then submits the School Safety Plan to the Board of Education for approval.
 
Before 
adopting its comprehensive 
School Safety Plan, the School Site Council and School Safety Plan Committee held a public 
meeting at the school site for input about the School Safety Plan which covers four components:
 
 

 
Personal characteristics of students and staff
 
 

 

physical environment
 
 

 

 
 

 

 
 
The students, staff, and community work together to create a sense of safety within the school. To support this 
endeavor, school rules and behavioral expectations are sent home at
 
the beginning of each school year for parents to 
review with their children. A comprehensive disaster plan and annual district
-
wide evacuation drill ensure the physical 
safety of students on campus in the event of an emergency. In addition to the feedback
 
offered on report cards, 

and behavior. Classroom rules, rewards, and consequences are posted in each room. There are monthly Student 
Reco
gnition Assemblies during which teachers recognize students for their positive attitudes and academic 
achievements.
 
 
The school safety plan is a public document and will be readily available for inspection at the school site and at the 
district office.
