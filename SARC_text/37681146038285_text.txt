About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Californ
ia is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agen
cies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data repo
rted in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta
/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school 
district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Fallbrook STEM Academy is committed to working with our parents to extend and enrich the school experience for all students. 
We believe in providing 
parents and fam
ilies with regular communication through our school website, Peachjar flyers, "all calls," social media feeds, and our weekly
 
communication folders. Opportunities for parents to engage in the school are outlined annually in our Parent and Family Engag
ement
 
Plan. We welcome 
parents on our campus and annually offer a "Meet and Greet" before school begins, a Fall "Back To School Night," student
-
led parent conferences, Coffee 
and Conversation with the Principal, a "Leadership Day," Family STEM events, and a Spr
ing "Open House." We offer a variety of parent volunteer, 
education, and engagement opportunities at our site. We encourage parents and community members to join the Parent Teacher As
sociation (PTA), and 
to participate by attending various school committee
 
meetings such as School Site Council (SSC), English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) and 
Lighthouse Leadership Meetings. For more information regarding parent involvement opportunities please see the school site Pa
rent and Family 
Engagement Plan, contact
 
the site administration or your child's teacher.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Each Fallbrook Union Elementary School District site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP), including a disaste
r preparedness plan 
annually. School administrators work closely w
ith local law enforcement, fire department and/or the Provost Marshall's Office on Camp Pendleton who 
review the plans and also participate in emergency drills, provide feedback, attend site and district safety meetings and col
laboratively help to improve 
overall campus safety, climate, and security.  Copies of the Comprehensive School Safety Plans are available for review at ea
ch school office. The plan 
includes emergency procedures for school safety, natural disasters, and campus intruders. It also contai
ns appropriate strategies and programs that will 

d to school safety. Students, 
teachers, and staff are trained to prepare for a wid
e range of emergency situations, and frequent drills help to refine emergency skills, policies, and 
procedures at all school sites. Following each drill, specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to co
ntinually improve emergency 
pro
cedures, and improve campus safety.
 
 
Finally, school and district administrators immediately investigate threats of harm. Teachers and administrators seek to fost
er lines of open 
communication so students and parents feel comfortable reporting inappropriat
e activity including bullying, harassment, or threats. All FUESD staff take 
a strong stand against threatening behavior or bullying and investigate complaint matters fully. Many positive programs exist
 
districtwide to enhance 
and continually improve school
 
culture and climate, including Positive Behavior Intervention and Support, Restorative Practices, Suicide Prevention, Anti
-
Vaping Education and Trauma
-
Informed Practices.
