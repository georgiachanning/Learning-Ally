By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Rowland Avenue Elementary School serves approximately 56
0 Kinder Academy through 5th grade students. Rowland 
Avenue Elementary School has received the following recognitions: Gold Ribbon School in 2016, California Distinguished 
School in 2006 and 2010, Computer Science Magnet School, Title I Achieving School, M
r. Holland's Opus National 
Endorsement and Grant Recipient, Golden Bell winner, and CBEE recipient.  Rowland Avenue is located 20 miles from 
downtown Los Angeles. It is one of nine elementary schools, three middle schools, three high schools, and one 
conti
nuation high school within the Covina
-
Valley Unified School District. The school was constructed in 1958 and 
modernized in 1993. Our entire school community benefits from a Library Media Center which houses a 15,000 book 
collection. More than seventy perce
nt of teachers have advanced degrees. To assist us in our mission and vision, we have 
several support personnel, including a Title 1 Intervention Specialist, two Special Education Teachers, a Psychologist, a 
Speech Pathologist, a Marriage and Family Therap
ist Intern, six instructional assistants, two school helpers, and five 
playground supervisors.  All teachers have personal laptops, projectors, document cameras, and Apple TVs.  Classrooms 
have 1:1 technology devices and we are partnering with Code to the 
Future to implement coding at all grade levels which 
culminates in an Epic Build each trimester.  A laptop cart supports technology integration in our Technology and Innovation 
lab.  Rowland Avenue has a wireless network with numerous access points.  A tea
cher maintains the school website and 
a PTA mom gives regular updates through Facebook.  When our Superintendent visits classrooms, he utilizes Twitter to 
inform others about the excellent teaching and learning happening at our school and our Computer Scie
nce Immersion 

-
away

from
-
home, family
-
oriented environment with high 
expectations and a "no excuses" attitude. Students create, collaborate, communicate, and critically think as they learn the 
skills n
eeded for success in an ever changing global society. They are challenged daily and realize the future holds unlimited 
possibilities.
 
 
The school has a rich blend of cultural heritages represented in its student population: 6.9% Asian, 1.2% Black or Africa
n 
American, 1.3% Filipino, 79.8% Hispanic or Latino, 5% White (not Hispanic), and 5.8% other. English Language Learners 
(ELL) make up 15.8% of our population, and 72% of our students are eligible for the Free and/or Reduced Lunch program.
 
 
Rowland Avenue s
taff works hard to provide our students with an educational environment that is safe and nurturing, has 
high expectations, and is enriching.  We have implemented the Raptorware System to ensure all volunteers have been 
cleared through a database.  We are a
 
school that celebrates attendance, academic performance, citizenship, homework 
completion, and great character. We work hard to instill in children the six pillars of Character Education: Responsibility, 
Caring, Respect, Trustworthiness, Fairness, and Cit
izenship. This has resulted in hard working students with great self
-
esteem, increased daily attendance, a low suspension rate, and increased parental support of school programs. Our 
teachers and staff believe that it is never too early to start talking ab
out college. Examples of this commitment can be 
seen all over our campus from the school office to the classrooms. Staff and students wear college shirts on Mondays.  
The entrance to each classroom and the office proudly display University Pennants. The pr
incipal and teachers have their 
degrees visible for all students to see. This demonstration supports the expectation that all students will be prepared for 
college and a successful career.

Our teachers work together in professional learning communities to
 
continuously improve student achievement. They 
focus on the following three guiding questions: "What do students need to know?", "How will we know if they know it?", 
and "What will we do with those that didn't learn it?" Along with strong first teaching a
nd differentiated instruction, each 
grade level provides their students with an additional thirty minutes of intervention/acceleration focusing on literacy and 
numeracy.  Certified GATE teachers address the learning needs of identified GATE students. Addit
ional resources include: 
i
-
Ready, a web based resource for all students in the areas of Language Arts and Math; Read Well, used with non
-
proficient 
students in grades 1
-
2 who need to improve in all areas of reading; Read Naturally for students in grades 1
-
5 who need to 
improve their reading fluency; WonderWorks as an intervention program for 3rd
-
5th graders; and online resources to 
improve math fact fluency. Teachers at each grade level have embraced Thinking Maps and Write from the Beginning and 
Beyond to 
support writing at all grade levels.
 
 
Other exciting programs at Rowland Avenue Elementary School include a schoolwide literacy effort that is possible 
because of our Accelerated Reader Program, generous support from the community, and outstanding parent v
olunteers. 
Students are motivated to read books, take quizzes, and earn prizes for passing their quizzes. Students scoring 100% on a 
quiz get a ticket for a monthly bike raffle made possible by our "Grandparent" who purchases two bikes and helmets per 
mont
h for us to give away. The library is open before school, during morning recess and lunch recess, and some days each 
week after school to provide students with opportunities to read and take quizzes or just have a place to do research and 
study.  We have i
nstituted Family Reading Nights once a month to encourage students to bring their parents and read 
together.  Students have been challenged to read 140,000,000 words during the 2018
-
2019 school year. Our fourth and 
fifth graders have an opportunity to run 
for Student Council.  If they are not elected to be officers, our teachers strive to 
develop future leaders by encouraging their participation as Room Representatives.  Student Council Officers and 
Representatives have an integral part of making announceme
nts during our Spirit and Pride Assemblies held the first 
Friday of each month.  They also have many opportunities to lead the student body in community service projects such as 
canned food drives, ongoing school recycling, and sock/hygiene basket drives f
or the homeless.  Our fourth and fifth grade 
students participate in Band, BEATS, or Glee. We received a $48,000 grant of musical instruments and National 
Endorsement from Mr. Holland's Opus Foundation. Student Patrol is a very popular program run by one o
f our 
instructional assistants.  She trains students to assist during lunch recess.  Rowland's school garden is a place to learn 
about nutrition and caring for our earth. We have GATE Saturdays that focus on Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, 
and Math 
(STEAM Saturdays). Students attend half day enrichment sessions and are invited to District field trips as well. 
Rowland also offers Science Saturday Academies to students who wish to recapture a missed day of attendance.
 
 
Rowland participates in many posi
tive relationships with the community to support student learning and citizenship. We 
enjoy the benefits of being adopted by a very generous family that buys books for our library, classroom supplies, rewards 
for reading, and much more.  Our campus hosts K
inder Academy, a Districtwide program for students as they prepare for 
all aspects of Kindergarten. Kids Korner provides before and after
-
school child care to students in grades TK
-
5. Rowland 
students benefit from participation in activities offered by Wes
t Covina Parks and Recreation Department and our 
neighboring park, Palmview. The Santa Clothes program from the Covina Sunrise Rotary Club generously provides school 
uniforms and other clothing items. Operation School Bell Program offered by the Assistance
 
League of Covina, 
DonorsChoose.com, and other programs offer support in the areas of health, social, academic and emotional well
-
being. 
A local businessman has adopted our school and recognizes excellent attendance with an "Iron Man Trophy."  Through 
gene
rous donations, we have equipped our Technology and Innovation Lab with a green screen and lighting. Students 
enjoy a reciprocal, intergenerational relationship with members of Bridgecreek Retirement Home. Retirees visit Rowland 
each week for our "Read Alo
ud Party" and students from Rowland have visited Bridgecreek for mini concerts or holiday 
carols.
 
 
Our PTA provides exciting field trips, assemblies, family nights, and other fun activities that truly make Rowland Avenue 
Elementary School a wonderful place
 


whether it is by volunteering in the classroom, b
y helping to organize and participate in PTA and school events or by simply 
reading to their children and making sure their homework is successfully completed. Our parents and PTA provide much 
needed support in the form of volunteer hours and fundraising t
o provide extra activities such as Red Ribbon Week

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Rowland Avenue Elementary School was built in 
1958 and modernized in 1993. Facilities are situated on 10.3 acres and 
span more than 50,000 square feet. They consist of permanent and portable classrooms, a cafeteria, administrative 
offices, restrooms, and storage rooms. Recent improvements at the schoo
l include a freshly painted kitchen, new carpet 
in eight classrooms and the office, and a few hundred linear feet of chain link fence to enclose our Kindergarten 
playground.  In August of 2015 the playground and parking lots were slurry sealed, and traffic
/parking markings and curbs 
were painted.  The facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample classrooms and playground space.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern at every school throughout the District. Each school complies with laws, 
rules, and regulations 

preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are 
conducted regularly throughout the school year. E




updates are completed if a school discipline policy is added or modified, changes are made to the campus map, additions 
and/or modifications are made to the telephone trees, etc. All visitors must che
ck in at the school office and wear a visitor 
badge while on school grounds. During lunch, recesses, and before and after school, staff members supervise students 
and school grounds, including the cafeteria and playgrounds, to ensure a safe and orderly env
ironment. The 
Comprehensive School Safety Plan was developed by administrators, other school staff members, and Los Angeles County 
Office of Education staff members. It is reviewed, approved, and evaluated by the School Site Council in cooperation with 
loc
al law enforcement in order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997. The plan provides students and staff a means to 
ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. Components of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan include the 
following: child abuse report
ing procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response 
procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress from school, sexual harassment policy, and suspension and expulsion 
policies. The plan is reviewed annually with school
 
staff. An updated copy is available to the public at the school and 
District Office.
