School Description
 
John Green Elementary School began its twelfth year in August 2018. Our school provides an exceptional learning experience 
for approximately 810 students in Developmental Kindergarten through fifth grade, including three Mild to Moderate 
Specialized Academ
ic Instruction (Special Day) Classes. Our staff is comprised of forty (40) teachers, six (6) specialized staff 
and nearly twenty (20) support staff members. John Green is a high performing school that celebrates a diverse community 
and an active parent pop
ulation in the Dublin Ranch area of the city. 
 
 
John Green Elementary School is a professional learning community that encourages ongoing collaboration to seek the most 
innovative and engaging instructional strategies. Data are used to guide instruction to
 
ensure that ALL students meet 
essential grade level standards. A Learning Center model has been adopted, integrating instruction for students in 
Intervention, with Individualized Learning Programs, and for students in Specialized Academic Instruction Clas
s placements. 
Administration works side by side with teachers and staff to ensure that every student is provided the best educational 

ta
lks, Next Generation Science Standards, and project based learning.
 
 
Various groups assist to make decisions that influence John Green Elementary School maintaining a focus on students' 
needs. School leadership is shared through our:
 

 
School Site Council (S
SC)
 

 
Parent Faculty Club (PFC)
 

 
English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
Various school committees
 

 
Student Council
 

 
Leadership Team comprised of teachers and administration
 

 
Intervention Strategies Team comprised of certificated staff/specialists and adminis
tration
 
These groups work closely to identify needs, define goals, and align our resources to provide an effective, research
-
 
based 
education for all students. Our community collaboratively strives to increase student learning through Dublin Unified School
 
District's Strategic Plan of the site based practice of Professional Learning Communities. Our grade level Professional 
Learning Communities work collaboratively in ongoing processes of collective inquiry and data analysis to achieve increased 
academic re
sults for the students we serve. At John Green Elementary School, student data are collected and analyzed by 
certificated staff to provide additional support and scaffolding for students not meeting standards, students working 
towards mastery, and enrichme
nt for students who demonstrate mastery of standards. The administration, certificated 
staff, classified staff, and parents work together to provide input to guide our community in our efforts to define the visio
n 
and outcomes for John Green students. Thro
ugh collaboration our grade level teams work to ensure student access to high
-
quality curriculum and instruction so the children may meet or exceed academic standards.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
dist
rict office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We choose ou
r textbooks from lists that have already been approved by the state education officials. For more than six years, panels of s
cholars have 
decided what California students should learn and be able to do. Their decisions are known as the California Content S
tandards, and they apply to all 
public schools in the state. The textbooks we use and the test we give are based on these content standards, and we expect ou
r teachers to be firmly 
focused on them.
 
 
All students have their own set of textbooks to use in cl
ass or at home.
 
 
The elementary, kindergarten to grade 5, English
-
Language Arts textbooks are from the 2002 adoption list not the most recent 2008 adoption list. During 
the current financial situation, districts have been given the flexibility to use State
 
funds for textbooks for other needs as approved by the local School 
Board. This flexibility allows districts to continue to use materials from the previous adoption list and still meet the requ
irement of having the most recent 
state
-
approved materials. Th
erefore, while our materials for K

5 English
-
Language Arts are not from the most recent state

approved list, we are still 
compliant with State regulations.

School Facility Conditions and Pla
nned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
John Green School opened in August of 2007. Our state
-
of
-
the
-
art campus currently includes 29 regular classrooms, 5 relocatable classrooms, a 
multipurpose room (cafeteria, gym, and stage), a library/media center and 
learning center, a music room, and a flexible
-
space room used for small group 
instruction. The outside area includes a playground with basketball courts, tether ball circles, and four
-
squares. The kindergarten classes have their own 
dedicated playground. E
ach playground has age
-
appropriate climbing and slide structures for students to play on, with padded foam mats underneath 
for safety.
 
 
We have one full time day custodian and one part time custodian and a district team cleans each classroom and the restro
oms every evening. District 
staff maintains landscaping on a regular weekly schedule.
 
 
We have a spacious, well
-
stocked, inviting library with a growing collection of books available to all of our students. The library contains four stud
ent 
computer statio

from the 
classroom and from home. Our media technician meets with every class each week, and teachers bring their classes to the li
brary for presentation and 
research sessions. Students can visit the library during breaks, lunch, and before school when the media technician is presen
t. Parent volunteers help 
our part
-
time librarian. We update our collection every year with funds from o
ur annual book fair.
 
 
We have 9 mobile computer carts, also known as Computers on Wheels (COWs). Each COW is stocked with 36 chromebooks, and are s
trategically located 
throughout the campus. Every class has a scheduled time to use the COWs. In addition to 
the mobile computer carts, lockers containing additional 
chromebooks were installed into each classroom, maintaining a 2:1 ratio of devices in each classroom.

Kindergarten classrooms have iPads and a printer for student and teacher use. All teachers have 
a dedicated teacher tablet
-
PC with a docking station 
that allows them to access the internet, record grades, and correspond via email with parents and colleagues. Every classroom
 
is also equipped with an 
interactive SMART board or large flat screen TV, doc
 
camera, and video display. Each classroom also has a fully adjustable sound system with six mounted 
speakers and two microphones.
 
 
The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this in
cludes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting,
 
and floor systems.

ho met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by th
e total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to pr
otect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level p
ercentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who received scores.

At John Green School, collaboration between staff and fami
lies is key to our success. Parent and guardian volunteers dedicate numerous hours to the 
school in a variety of ways. There are over 500 approved volunteers and we routinely have over 100 regular (one or more times
 
per week) classroom 
volunteers each year
. In addition, our Parent Faculty Club (PFC) has organized parents to volunteer for a variety of events and activities, inclu
ding Art, 
Junior Achievement, Copy Squad, a jog

a
-
thon (Gator Gallop), STEM/STEAM, Destination Imagination, science and books fairs
, Project Cornerstone, a 
Gator Garden club, and more. The PFC is a huge supporter and major contributor of programs, activities, enrichment materials 
for our students, and they 
work strategically with School Site Council (SSC) to support school
-
wide goals.
 
 
The School Site Council (SSC) is composed of five parents and five staff, including the principal, who make budgetary recomme
ndations that support the 

 
English Learners and English Language 
Development staff. Similarly the Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) committee is made up of interested parents whose childr
en qualify for 
identification as GATE, and GATE certified staff representatives.

School Safety Plan
 
John Green Elementary School is a closed
 
campus with a perimeter fence. The Principal, Assistant Principal, Campus Supervisor and teachers monitor the 
school grounds throughout the school day. The Principal, Assistant Principal, Campus Supervisor, and three to four noon super
visors monitor stude
nts at 
lunchtime. Teachers regularly review the three school rules for safe, respectful and responsible behavior in school and on th
e grounds. During school 
hours, visitors use the main entrance and sign in at the office. Regular visitors and volunteers ar
e required to complete a Visitor/Volunteer Clearance 

nd given a clearance by 
the office staff before working in or visiting classro
oms. As of November 1, 2018 there are over 780 cleared visitors and volunteers.
 
 
Our School Safety Plan is revised annually. The plan includes procedures for emergencies, locations of exit routes, and inven
tories of emergency supplies. 
It is available in t
he school office, and we share the plan with all staff during a schoolwide staff meeting. We share the plan with parents at t
he first 
Principal's Coffee of the year in August. We practice fire drills and shelter
-
in
-
place drills monthly. We practice earthqu
ake drills and lockdown drills each 
trimester. There are various trainings for staff throughout the year on emergency preparedness.
 
 
Please note: all trainings include information about Incident Command System procedures and Incident Command Team 
responsibilities, dialogue around 
a variety of scenarios and how to respond. In addition, there is training on intruder on campus and discussions on how to com
municate and train students.
 
 
The School Safety Plan was last reviewed, updated, and discussed wi
th the entire staff on August 13th (all staff), August 20th (certificated staff) and 
August 21st (classified staff) 2018.

At John Green Elementary, dedicated staff development days are scheduled on the school
-
year calendar during the negotiation process between the 
District and the Teacher's Association. Content for two of the three days is determined by the District based on
 
areas of focus, textbook adoption cycles, 

oral data, attendance data 
and more to assist in reviewing and modifying instructional p
rograms. The third Staff Development day is determined in collaboration between the staff 
and principal.
 
 
Additional staff development opportunities take place during trainings where teachers are released through use of substitutes
 
to attend workshops or 
c
onferences, at District sponsored after school workshops, during grade level collaboration, and via site
-
based coaches. Some of these Professional 
Development trainings include: Legal training, student privacy laws, Capturing Kids Hearts, Technology traini
ng, Cultural Responsive training, Instuctional 
Leadership Team training, Benchmark Advance Training, Safety Care to name a few.
 
 

g 
System Illuminate, 
technology training, mathematics, English language arts, writing, science, Safety Care and RTI.
 
 
Teachers have piloted the adoption of new textbooks, served on district committees to develop interim assessments, and attend
ed workshops to
 
improve 
their skills. Peer lead teacher training at our school site in the areas of customizing instruction, technology, and math. We
 
dismiss students at 2:00 p.m. 
on Monday and Tuesday to allow time for teachers to collaborate, both within and across gra
de levels. We also have 21 days district wide where students 
are released at 2:00 so teachers can collaborate.
