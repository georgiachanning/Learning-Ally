By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Samuel E. Talbert Middle School is a California Distinguished School (2019) and a California Gold Ribbon School (2015) 
serving approximately 775 students in the city of Huntington Beach.  Talbert is one of 10 schools in the Fountain Valley 
Schoo
l District providing a world
-
class education for all students.  We offer a challenging education to all students at their 
various levels, ranging from accelerated honors classes to classes with extra support to meet the needs of all students.  
Talbert is d
edicated to providing students a nurturing environment balanced with fun and learning.  Staff and parents 
work collaboratively to support our children as an educational team for the betterment of all students.
 
 
Talbert Middle School believes in students:  
collaboration, engagement, innovation, problem
-
solving, and rigor for ALL.  
This vision drives our goals and priorities at our school.  While the theme for the 2019
-
2020 school year is "Full STEAM 
Ahead!,"  it is a philosophical commitment on behalf of our
 
staff to continue to serve all students to the best of our ability.  
While we have had a STEAM cohort program for the last six years, we are rolling out the important components of that 
program this year to affect all 6th grade students. In addition, prof
essional development in Depth and Complexity is 
providing staff tools to develop independent, high level thinkers and learners.
 
 
At Talbert, students come first!  What sets our school apart from others is the ability to challenge and nurture our students
 
d
uring their middle school experience in an environment that meets the needs of our kids.  We have several opportunities 
to connect kids to school such as homeroom sports, after school clubs and sports, and lunchtime activities. Talbert offers 
many leadersh
ip opportunities as well through participation in our ASB, PAL, Yearbook, and STEAM programs.  For 
students who need additional support, math and reading interventions are offered throughout the school day, as well as, 
Homework Club after school.  Furtherm
ore, we are proud to recognize and reward students for their academic and 

 
 
In effort to support ALL students, Talbert is focused supporting all individu
als to do their best.  Honors ELA and history 
classes are offered for students who benefit from the challenge.  It is our goal for all students to read and write at grade 
level before leaving 8th grade.  Intervention electives in reading and math as well a
s Specialized Academic Instruction 
courses are available for students needing support.  All staff have been trained in Depth and Complexity instructional 
strategies.  These strategies support every level of child to be independent learners.  Furthermore, a
 
focus on STEAM 
learning is preparing students for skills of the future including collaboration, problem solving, and how to persevere.  The 
focus in these two areas alongside department instructional initiatives, provides students an excellent middle scho
ol 
education.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Talbert Middle School was originally constructed in 1972 and completely modernized between 2003 and 2005. The school 
is currently co
mprised of 31 classrooms, a library, an event center, a wood shop, and a spacious playground. The facility 
strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample classroom and recreational space.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 

Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the District. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily 
basis thro
ughout the school year with an emphasis on classrooms and restrooms. A joint effort between students and 
staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

schedules that ensure a 
clean, safe, and functional learning environment.

Maintenance & Repair:
 

complex maintenance functions occurring during vacation period
s. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is 
administered by Fountain Valley School District's Maintenance & Operations Department to ensure that school grounds 
and facilities remain in excellent repair. A work order process is used when issues aris
e that require immediate attention. 
Emergency repairs are given the highest priority; repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which they 
are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
Deferred maintenance includes roofing, plumbing, heat
ing, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. Fountain Valley School District did not participate in the State School Deferred Maintenance 
Budget Program. Fountain Valley School District sets aside funds each 
year to specifically address deferred maintenance 
needs. The passing of Measure O provided additional, much
-
needed funds for these types of projects.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP]
 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight
 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant co
gnitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or program
s 
of study.

administrators, and classified staff in effort to keep the campus safe.  All visitors to the campus must check in at the main
 
office throug
h the Raptor guest management system. 
 

school grounds.
 
 
Talbert has a disaster preparedness plan that includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire, 
earthqua
ke, shelter in place, and lockdown drills are conducted on a rotating basis throughout the school year. Talbert 
staff participated in professional development related to safety during the 2019
-
20 school year where they were trained 
in Stop the Bleed proced
ures, updated the school's the safety bin, 
 
and practiced using the Titan emergency alert 
system.
 
 
 
 
In the case of an emergency, parents are asked to check out students in the 6th and 7th Grade Bowl.

While we have had a STEAM cohort program for the last six years, we are rolling out the important components of that 
program this year 
to affect all 6th grade students. The 6th grade team has built a unit on water, which is a theme based 
unit across the curriculum. All departments are participating, including physical education. Six graders who participate in 
the elective wheel will take 
an engineering elective in which they will build their own water filtration system in groups. 
The classes will then visit the Orange County Water District to get a real life experience. Through ELA, students will be 
reading A Long Walk to Water, by Linda S
ue Park, a novel based on the impact of a lack of water resources in Sedan. They 
will be building a water receptacle through science classes for them to carry water across barriers in PE to symbolize the 
treacherous process that young girls in Sudan go thr
ough to fetch water for their families. There will also be a giving back 
to the world activity where students will campaign to raise money for students in Sudan who don't get to go to school 
because they spend their days securing water for their families t
o survive. Donations will go to building wells in Sudan. 
Two release days for the 6th grade team as well as collaboration with Orange County Department of Education's, STEM 
learning consultant has provided professional development time for teachers to plan
 
the new unit. The 7th grade team 
will have two planning days this year as well in preparation for the new 7th grade cross
-
curricular STEAM unit to be rolled 
out in 2020
-
2021.
 
 
Depth and Complexity
 
 
In addition, professional development in Depth and Comple
xity is providing staff tools to develop independent, high level 
thinkers and learners. Talbert staff has been working with Lisa Wright, a Depth and Complexity trainer, who has several 
years of training under Sandra Kaplan, the pioneer of Depth and Complex
ity. The entire staff has received in
-
depth training 
through staff development days and afternoons in strategies to help all students think independently at a deeper level. 
Strategies focus on utilizing the icons as well as questioning strategies, essentia
l questions, and universal themes.
 
 
Reading and Writing
 
 
Reading is the number one predictor of a child's educational success. A committee of five ELA teachers and one history 
teacher are working together to build a protocol of strategies to support readin
g and writing in all curricular areas. Some 
of the strategies will be rolled out next year. This will be a continued multi
-
year effort. Currently, the impact of this team 
has affected the use of Newsela, a non
-
fiction text program which provides leveled te
xts to support students, as well as a 
focus on how to annotate texts.
 
 
District
-
wide Staff Development
 
 
Each subject area team participates in district
-
wide curricular initiatives. Science and history departments are piloting new 
materials to be adopted for 2020
-
2021. ELA is focused developing a third common novel unit at every grade level as well 
and piloti
ng a benchmark. Math is focused on the Irvine Math Project and McGraw Hill textbook materials refinement, 
common assessments, and piloting a benchmark system. The PE and music departments from across the school district 
collaborate at regularly scheduled m
eetings to improve instruction and provide some common practices.
