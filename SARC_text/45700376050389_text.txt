By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Indian Springs School is located in the Cascade Mountains of Northern Califor
nia in a remote and isolated part of Shasta 
County, 36 miles east of Redding and an additional 17 miles north of Route 299, in the community of Big Bend. The local 
elevation of 1,800 feet ensures a moderae range of annual temperatures. Over a period of tim
e dating back to the 1860's, 
the potential for hydro
-
power production was recognized along the Pit River. As a result of this resource, PG&E 
constructed a series of power plants utilizing the water resources of our area. These projects are among the larges
t in the 
State of California and represent a major contribution to the tax
-
base that funds our District. Over the past several years, 
deregulation of the power industry has turned into depreciation of the hydro plants along our rivers. This has caused a 
ma
jor decline in the revenue base for the Indian Springs School District.
 
 
Indian Springs is currently a two
-
teacher and one paraprofessional, one
-
school District, pre
-
kindergarten through eighth 
grade. The Big Bend area has a population base of around 200 res
idents throughout the year, with that figure rising during 
the summer vacation season. The school is the main source of pride and spirit for the community at large.
 
 
Indian Springs is a small, very rural school. This allows for targeted instruction at each s

individualized learning goals for each child based on the new California State Standards. The school has a homey 
atmosphere with a school kitchen known to create and serve delicious gourmet meals.
 
 
The school enjoys great community participation at school
-
sponsored events and has very active parent involvement. The 
school regularly
 
hosts two track meets which are attended by other schools in the area.
 
 
Mission Statement

ive and creative teaching methods to develop the fullest potential in each
 
student in the

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education populati
on and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the re
quirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Night held 
annually, parents are warmly invited and encouraged to be a part of the school.
 
 
Parents and school staff participate in the School Site Council (
SSC) And the District Advisory Committee for the Local 
Control Accountibility Plan (LCAP).  We have an after school program called SHARE where parents are invited to participate 
and help with activities. Volunteer parents supplement
 
regular instruction by 
offering instruction in their hobbies, 
professions, and avocations as part of the Spring Enrichment program offerings.
 
 
For more information on how to become involved, please contact Administrative Assistant Jamie Stenland
 
at (530) 337

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety Plan was last reviewed and discussed with the school faculty January/February 2020. The revision was 
complete January/February 2020 and includes input from The Shasta County Sheriff"s Depar
tment.
 
 
The School Safety Plan is designed to protect the physical safety of all students and adults on the school site at all times.
 
All school attendees regularly practice drills and practices for fire, intruder, and meteorological crises. The office and 
classroom staff regularly review emergency practices and discuss
 
appropriate responses to various emergency scenarios.
 
 
Staff members are regularly trained in first aid and CPR activities.  All staff is regularly trained in appropriate playgroun
d
 
practices 
and how to prevent student aggression and potential violence.
 
 
A  "buzz in" system have been installed at the school site with a camera and intercom. During the school day the secretary 
screens and allows entry to individuals that have a reason to enter. A
fter school the teacher for the after school program 
takes over that task.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
Small class size is the reality at Indian Springs School. Enrollment during the 18
-
19 year enrollment hovered around 13 
students. The students were taught by two fully credentialed teachers assisted by one paraprofessional (6.25 hours per 
day). Students can't get lost with that ratio of one adult for every 3.25 students. Title three and REAP funds are used to 
maintain the s
mall class size. A Resource Teacher works work with any student that has an IEP. She also is a resource for 
the instructional staff.  Regular assessments are given three times per year to measure student growth and drive each 
students individual learning p
lan. Teachers and paraprofessional work closely with students to help and support learning.
 
Staff members participate in professional development on a regular basis. There is an active Professional Learning 
Community (PLC) at the site.

Professional Development (Most Recent Three Years)
 
 
The teachers on site are encouraged to pursue additional staff development. The collective bargaining agreement allows 
up to three days of additional pay for any qualified teacher training. Our 
teachers have played an integral role in the county 
curriculum review process for new curricular adoptions.
 
 
Staff continually collaborates to enhance the school programs by staying up with the best practices and current curriculum 
trends. There is an activ
e PLC at the site. Assessment results are reviewed by staff as part of the evaluation of the total 
program.
 
 
The Board supports professional development for all staff and budgets each year for workshops and conferences.
 
Both teachers participate in county w
ide Common Core Math and Language Art Professional Development..
