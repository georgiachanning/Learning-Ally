By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Mark Twain was established in 1950 in Lawndale, California. 
Since then, the school community has grown to serve over 
560 students representing a diverse community with over 13 languages spoken in Kindergarten through 5th grade.  Mark 
Twain develops students academically, socially and emotionally.   Instruction is a
ligned to the California Common Core 
State Standards and fosters critical thinking skills and prepares students for college and career.  As of 2018, Mark Twain 
housed Regionalized Program that services students with moderate to severe autism. We also house
 

Immersion Program, designed to lead students to develop bilingualism, biliteracy and multiculturalism.
 
 
Parents and partnerships are vital to the student success at Mark Twain Elementary. Through our PTA sponsorship, our 
students recei
ve amazing field trip experiences, have access to the latest technology, academic and fun family nights. In 
addition to this, Mark Twain has been designated as a National PTA School of Excellence and was awarded the 2019 
Phoebe Apperson Hearst Award. We pr
omote health and wellness by providing a weekly mileage club event on Fridays  
where families are invited to exercise together and encourage healthy eating by highlighting a fruit or vegetable each 
month.  Our garden which is run by volunteers hosts outdoo
r lessons for all students. Students have opportunities to 
participate in our before/after school RAP (Realizing Amazing Potential) program, noon sport leagues, student council 
leadership, after
-
school enrichment classes, Cross
-
age tutoring, Fun Fitness Fr
idays and our Mark Twain mileage club. In 
addition to this, we have a partnership with P.S. Arts, where all students experience the arts through a 3 cycle rotation: 
art, music, an theater.
 
 
Mark Twain Elementary is truly a school that instills a genuine se

completed in a timely 
manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority. The Maintenance Department responds to our needs in a timely manner. The district governing 
board has adopted cleaning standards for
 
all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the school 
office and at the district office. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure
 
a clean and safe school. The custodial staff
 
cleans restrooms and classrooms daily as inspected by site administrators 
weekly.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School 
safety is the number one priority at Twain.  The school is a closed campus and gates remain locked during school 
hours. All parents and visitors must check in through the office to access the school grounds. Noon duty supervisors 
oversee the children both 
before and after school and at lunch with support of social worker, interns and administrators.  
Teachers supervise all students during recess.
 
 
Mark Twain School provides classrooms, staff rooms, and playgrounds that are safe and clean and support a posit
ive 
environment for teaching and learning.  Two full time custodians perform basic cleaning operations at our school site. 
Classrooms are cleaned every other day and restrooms are cleaned daily.  The District maintenance and grounds 
departments provide add
itional services as needed and maintain the grounds on a weekly basis. One .5 custodian at night 
support with TRP.
 
 
A Comprehensive Safety Plan is in place for our school. Key elements include emergency procedures, evacuation location, 
and 
assignment of personnel in a crisis. All emergency classroom and site supplies were updated this year. Emergency 
drills are performed monthly and the school participates in the Great Shake Out preparedness drill.  This plan is available 
in the school offic
e.  The Safety Plan was last discussed with all staff on October  20119 and safety continues to be a 
relevant topic throughout the year. The key components of the plan include three different drills and the chain of 
command in the case of an emergency. Als
o lists the various safe practices for students inside and out of classroom. 
Universal bell schedules were implemented in 2004 so that emergency bell signals are the same at all schools. Each 
classroom has a safety backpack which stays with the teacher dur
ing emergencies. Emergency drills for fire,earthquake, 
lock out and other emergencies are held on a regular basis.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and 
Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The LESD Education Services team in collaboration with the Language Arts Specialists, Math TOSAs, English Language 
Instructional Resource Teachers and Principals have designed a comprehensive system for monthly 
professional 
development.  All district professional development occurs on Thursdays after school following an early release day.   
Topics are selected based on expressed teacher need and identified student deficiencies.  All professional development in 
th
e LESD focuses on meaningful collaboration, developing teacher capacity and the implementation of research based 
practices to support student achievement.
 
 
Professional development focuses on the instructional shifts needed to meet the rigorous demands of 
the Common Core 
State Standards and the need to support development of academic discourse for all students, with an emphasis on English 
language learners.  All TK
-
5th grade teachers receive professional development support in the areas of social
-
emotional 
learning, Math warm
-
ups, and integrated ELD. Collaboration time is spent on data analysis and planning in the areas of 
English Language Arts, Math, and ELD. Teachers receive professional development in structured cycles that afford them 
the opportunity to 
learn about a new concept, plan for implementation with their colleagues, practice their learning with 
students, and then come back with their colleagues to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of their instructional 
implementation of the new skill.
 
 
Feedb
ack about the effectiveness of the professional development is regularly collected to assess the effectiveness of the 
program and make changes as needed.  Additionally, site staff members and Educational Services team members regularly 
visit classrooms to 
determine the level of implementation of the professional development focus.
