performance is the direct result of educators colla
borating to track student progress to ensure that 
students are learning in a safe and enriching environment.
 
 
 
All staff have embraced the concept of curricular and pedagogical shifts associated with Common 
Core implementation, and are promoting a student
-
centered classroom with a gradual release of 
responsibility. Staff has access to rich professional development 
opportunities; focused on literacy 
development and STEM enrichment.  Through parent involvement opportunities we continue to 
find ways to educate the community to understand and embrace the important tenants of common 
core.
 
 
One of our greatest challenges 
is the frequent deployments of our military family members. 
Community service agencies and Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton collaborate with the District 
to provide our school with excellent support programs; helping us to remain resilient and sensitive

At Stuart Mesa Elementary School, our vision is to develop into a community of learners who exhibit 
a confident willingness to engage in gaining new skills and understanding essential academic 
concepts.  Students work to r

and becoming 21st century critical thinkers. Technology will link our students with resources well 
beyond the bricks and mortar of the school walls. Learning at new levels will be within the 
reach of 
every student regardless of foundational skills and ability. Teachers will be effective and efficient 
and they will have access to real

Teachers present relevant materials that require students to think.  Creativity is valued and

encourage students to express their unique thought processes.  They
 
accept the responsibility to 
provide evidence showing that their answers are reasonable.
 
 
Classroom discussions are lively and students are eager to gain knowledge that helps them form

Through practice with the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and The Leader in Me, our students develop strength of characte
r and take 
ownership of their learning and behavior. They un
derstand that leadership is shared, and each of us is a leader because each of us has a 
talent in something.  With adult guidance, students use empathy, information and critical thinking to solve academic and soci
al problems. 
Citizenship and social skill g
rowth are essential elements of student learning at our school.
 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability R
eport Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accounta
bility Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SA
RC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co

with our families in mind.  
Many of their fund raisers involve the who family, such a
s Fright Night and Family Bingo Night.  This group raises about $15,000 annually which funds 
instructional materials and resources for every class.  Parent and military volunteers commit more than 200 hours a month to 
support the classroom 
teachers in many
 
ways. Our School Site Council consists of dedicated parents who, in conjunction with teachers and staff, oversee and approve 
the 
implementation of our school plan and its Title 1 expenditures.
 
 
The staff holds Title I parent informational nights annually,
 
and hosts a variety of Family Nights.  Family Fun Nights are sponsored quarterly by the school, 
and focus on: literacy, art, technology and STEM.  We also welcome families to join us once a month for Lunch on the Lawn so

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil 
expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Staff members supervise our clean, safe playgrounds before, during, and after school. Through The Leader in Me and character 
education, we teach 
conflict 
resolution skills to help students communicate and settle disputes peacefully. We implement Positive Behavioral Interventions
 
and Supports to 
reinforce behavioral expectations and support our students when they have made a behavioral mistake. Our Flag Cere
monies, held once per trimester, 
reinforce positive character traits through The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.  We also recognize students who were Lea
der of the Month as students 
who demonstrated one of the 7 Habits.   Students are rewarded daily b
y: being proactive, putting first things first, beginning with the end in mind, 
thinking win
-
win, seeking first to understand, synergizing, sharpening the saw, and finding their voice with PAWSitive Leadership Cards. W
e also educate 
students about bullying
 
and how to avoid involvement in this kind of behavior. Stuart Mesa Elementary School is a closed campus, and all visitors are
 

 
pri

approved Safe School Plan. We work with the Camp Pendleton Police and the 
Oceanside Police Department to develop and rehearse our Cris
is Response Plan using tabletop exercises and emergency response drills. Teachers and 
staff have recently reviewed recommended lockdown procedures so that we are all capable of rapid response. An annual visit by
 
our district safety officer 
ensures that our
 
Disaster Shed is stocked properly and there are no physical safety hazards on our campus.
 
 
This year our comprehensive school safety plan includes: child abuse reporting procedures, disaster procedures, policies for 
suspension and expulsion, 
procedures to
 
notify teachers of dangerous students, discrimination and harassment policy, the provisions of a school
-
wide dress code, procedures for 
safe ingress and egress, a safe and orderly learning environment, procedures for school discipline, and hate crime repo
rting procedures.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers invest time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. Her
e you'll see the amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development.
 
Please find the attached assessment calendar 
which will provide dates for implementing assessments and collecting student achievement data. In addition, teachers meet reg
ularly as a Professional 
Learning Community to focus on student data as a means to dr
ive their instruction. The specific focus of this year is building proficiency in literacy through 
the effective implementation of the Reading and Writing Units of Study. Teachers will also receive professional development a
t the site with respect to 
stude
nt discourse, PBIS, and The Leader in Me. Teachers at Stuart Mesa will continue to facilitate an Inquiry Model of Instruction
 
working towards a full 
implementation of Project Based Learning for the 2018/19 school year.

eds many 
of you have articulated regarding the math assessments. Specifically, teachers will work to develop a set of common unit 
assessments for specific units 
that will help teachers gauge student understanding of content. Elementary teachers have: identified the many variables assoc
iated with common 
assessments, then we "affinity
-
mapped" those variables accordingly, spent time rev
iewing the various blueprints and guides (e.g. SBAC, CCSS
-
M) to 
identify standards that are key to each grade level, and created at least 1 assessment per grade level. Next steps include dr
afting assessments with 
teachers. 
 
 
Grades 6

8 will begin a new par
tnership with UCI to unpack the CCSS and deepen our content knowledge and OUSD blueprints. The focus of the district 
work group time will be: unpacking the relevant standards in the state framework and progressions as well as discussion of th
e embedded mat
h practices 
and pedagogy, building out single, coherent units, opportunities to engage in hands
-
on lessons that build students' conceptual understanding and leading 
to procedural development, and time to create unit pacing including the ideal progression o
f the topic along with suggested resources.
