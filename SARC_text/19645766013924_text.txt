School Description
 
Welcome to Sutherland Elementary School!  Sutherland 
Elementary school is home to dedicated 
teaching and support staff, motivated students, supportive parents, and community members. We 
are proud to offer a rigorous academic program which challenges students and helps them reach 
their full potential. Our cur
riculum is aligned with California State Standards. Our students are 
exposed to 21st century learning where innovation, creativity and critical thinking skills are 
fostered. Sutherland students learn to work in cooperative groups and apply new knowledge to
 
real
-
life situations.
 
 
Along with academics, Sutherland Cougars also covet citizenship. We believe that providing a 
quality education also involves focusing on character traits. Each month, students focus on different 
character traits such as responsibili
ty, trustworthiness, and respectfulness. These character traits 
are highlighted and students who exhibit these traits are recognized at monthly student of the 
month assemblies.
 
 
Sutherland Elementary School participates in Positive Behavior and Interventio
n Strategies (PBIS). 
We support positive behavior and recognize students who go above and beyond in their classroom 
and on the playground. Discipline and behavior issues follow a chain of command based on minor 
and major occurences.
 
 
We are appreciative of
 
the wonderful support of our Sutherland families staff, and community 
members and hope that this report will provide useful information.  For further information please

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessme
nts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards,
 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the 
University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical
