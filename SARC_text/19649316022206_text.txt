About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a 
School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Loc
al Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with 
data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about th
e LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or t
he 
district office.

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

Savannah parents and the community are extremely supportive of the educational programs at Savannah School. The PTA has made 
generous 
contributions of time and money to numerous programs and activities. PTA fundraisers support field trips,
 
student recognition programs, extra 
equipment, and instructional material needs. Various community members also participate in the school events and make them fe
stive and more 
enjoyable.

School Safety Plan
 
Savannah 
School is a safe and closed campus. During school hours, the entrance is secured to ensure visitors check in at the front off
ice. All visitors are 
required to sign in and wear visitor badges during their stay. While we welcome visits by parents and communi
ty members, anyone wishing to be on 
campus during school hours should notify staff ahead of time. During lunch, breaks, and before and after school, yard
-
duty supervisors and teachers 
supervise students and monitor the campus, including the cafeteria and p
laygrounds, to ensure a safe and orderly environment.
 
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the district to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The plan pr
ovides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning 
environment. Our school safety plan includes the following requirements of SB 187: current status of 
school crime; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, both routine and emergency; policies related to suspensi
on and expulsion, and 
notifica
tion to teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and school employees; 
safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annu
ally and updates it as needed. The plan was last updated in September, 2019 and reviewed with school staff in October, 
2019. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Plan, are reviewed with school and district staff throughout t
he school ye
ar during various 
safety training opportunities and emergency drills.
