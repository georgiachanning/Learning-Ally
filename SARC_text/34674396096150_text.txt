School Description
 
Children are first at James Marshall.  Staff is engaging every student so they are challenged in a 
meaningful and captivating manner.  There are strong community ties creating a happy and safe 
environment for students.
 
 
James W. Marshall Elementary is loca
ted in the heart of the Rosemont community.  The entire staff 
at James Marshall is committed to the academic and social emotional success of every student.  
Teachers and support staff collaborate on a regular basis to review data to help guide daily 
instru
ction.  We have several programs that enhance our daily classroom instruction.  By effectively 
utilizing paraprofessionals and resource teachers, we provide leveled intervention in English
-
language arts for all primary students during the school day.  This
 
model allows for small group 

Sacramento and benefits from two different programs.  The CSUS Readers program provides one 
on one before school tutoring in reading 
and the Classroom Tutoring program provides college 
students who help in classrooms on campus.  In addition, students are served by a variety of 
different Special Education classes on campus.
 
 

ries to focus on the whole child.  We 
integrate social emotional learning and character education into our daily teaching.  Our focus for 
the past few years has been kindness.
 
 
Additionally, we offer extracurricular activities whenever possible.  We have a
n active flag football 
team, basketball team and the Stride Program as well as fun filled and educational field trips and 

We have an excellent Physical Educat
ion program as well.
 
 
Parent involvement is encouraged at James Marshall.  Parents are very active in our Parent Teacher 
Group as well as our School Site Council and English Learner Advisory Committee.  Parents are 
welcome on campus anytime and can volunte
er in classrooms. The Parent Teacher Group and the 
staff at James Marshall work collectively to provide as many opportunities for parent education as 
possible, such as Family Science Night and an annual Art Show.
 
 
James Marshall has Pre
-
School on 
site.  Free after school care, academic support and enrichment 
activities are also available through the Target Excellence program.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The district instructional material evaluation committee, consisted of members representing teachers, administrators, other s
taff, students, 
parents/guardians, and community,
 
ensures that the selected textbooks, technology
-
based materials and other educational materials effectively support 
the district's adopted courses of study and meet current curricular goals and California Content Standards. Teachers, student
s, parents/gua
rdians and 
community members have the opportunity to review and provide input about the instructional materials being considered for ado
ption. 
Recommendations for the adoption and/or withdrawal of instructional materials by the instructional material evalu
ation committee are presented to 
the Board by the Superintendent or designee and include documentation supporting the recommendation. In some instances, the c
onsidered textbooks 
and/or instructional materials are piloted for a period of time before being r
ecommended for adoption to the Board of Education.

the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

Professional 
Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professiona
l repertoire of its administrators and teachers.

To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including ELA 
Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of 
Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Linguistically Relevant Teaching and Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through this program deeply align with the needs of our ind
ividual schools, as well 
as
 
our Local Control Accountability Plan, and connect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional instr
uctional practices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson design.
 
 
Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hou
rs and outside of contracted hours. In addition to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunity for teachers to engage
 
in collaborative 
professional learning at their re
spective schools focusing on deepening their content knowledge, strengthening their instructional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of responsibility.
