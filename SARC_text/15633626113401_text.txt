By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Bill L. Williams provides a safe and clean environment for learning. A scheduled maintenance program is administered by 
the District to ensure
 
that all classrooms and facilities are maintained to a degree of adequacy that provides for good 

 
Coordinator of Safety and Risk M
anagement verifies quarterly that OSHA requirements are met. The exterior grounds are 
well lit and the perimeter of the school facility is fenced for student protection and safety. A team of custodians ensures 
classrooms and campus grounds are kept clean a
nd safe. The restrooms are cleaned, sanitized and secured at the end of 
each school day with 100% of the toilets in operating condition. As outlined in our Safe Schools Plan, the safety committee 
has addressed concerns for the safe coming and going of our 
students. The committee feels that security of all students is 
of the highest priority. Staff receives inservice in emergency protocol and CPR. All district employees, including substitute
s, 
must wear identification badges while on our site or any district
 
site. Visitor badges are issued to parents entering our 
campus, volunteers, and other visitors as they register in our office. The gates on the perimeter of the school playground 
are locked during school hours and staff members are trained to activate loc
k down procedures in the event of an 
emergency. Our positive partnership with local law enforcement is evident in their quick response time when concerns 
arise. Designated staff members carefully supervise students on the playground and in the cafeteria. G
rounds and 
playground equipment are inspected regularly for potential hazards. The District provides on
-
going training in CPR/First 
Aid as part of its staff development program. Fire and/or disaster drills occur monthly and a complete school site disaster 
plan has been prepared and is in place and available for public review. Scheduled certificated supervision of students 
begins officially thirty minutes prior to the start of school (7:50) and ten minutes after the end of school (3:20).

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide
 
assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for En
glish language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked
 
with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California a
nd the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

provide students with opportunities to learn self
-
discipline through a system of consistent rewards and consequences for 
their behavior.
  
Williams Elementary School believes students who develop a sense of personal responsibility will mature 
both academically and emotionally.  Parents and students are informed of discipline policies at the beginning of each 
school year through classroom or
ientation as well as individual parent
-
student handbooks.
 
 
We have established a School Safety Plan that is reviewed and updated annually by our School Site Council with input 
from our ELAC. This plan includes information such as, but not limited to, how w
e are a closed campus, visitors are 
identified by all staff members, and specific training including first aide and CPR that some of our staff is certified with 
at 
this time. Our Safety Plan was reviewed, updated, discussed, and approved at our SSC meeting
 
on Wednesday, October 
17th, 2019.
 
 
Students with excessive tardies, truancies or unexcused absences are subject to disciplinary action including loss of recess 

strict has established an 
Independent Study Program for students who must be absent from school due to illness for an extended period of time.

Williams establishes guidelines to provide students with a meaningful, productive, and enjoyable school experien
ce.  
Appropriate behavior is encouraged through praise and motivational incentives as well as assertive discipline and conflict 
resolution tools to further develop personal growth.  Expulsions occur only when required by law or when all other 
alternatives 
are exhausted.

educational agencies (LEAs) and schools with high numbers or high percentages of children from low
-
income families to 
hel
p ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards. Title I is designed to help students served by the 
program to achieve proficiency on challenging State academic achievement standards. Title I schools with percentages of 
students from l
ow
-
income families of at least 40 percent may use Title I funds, along with other Federal, State, and local 
funds, to operate a "school wide program" to upgrade the instructional program for the whole school. Based on an analysis 
of student achievement dat
a done be the school site, Title I resources may be used for professional development, 
supplemental instruction and intervention, parental involvement, personalization and support for students with at
-

behaviors. Targeted assistance schools design, in 
consultation with parents, staff, and district staff, an instructional 
program to meet the needs of specifically identified students who are failing, or most at risk of failing, to meet the State'
s 
challenging academic achievement standards . Both school w
ide and targeted assistance programs must use instructional 
strategies based on scientifically based research and implement parental involvement activities.
