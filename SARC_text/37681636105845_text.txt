School Description
 
Although nestled on the outskirts of the small rural mountain community of Julian, California, Julian 
Union School District functions as the hub and center of the community. The school plays an 
integral part in the lives of the families, the neighboring bu
sinesses and the surrounding 
community. The quaint, rustic looking town of Julian is located sixty miles northeast of San Diego, 
and is an extremely popular tourist retreat throughout the year. Known as the apple country, the 
old fashioned, picturesque tow
ns privacy and close knit community atmosphere is highly valued by 
the local townspeople, many of whose families have lived in the area for several generations. Julian 
Union is a school district consisting of one elementary and one junior high school.
 
 
Sin
ce the attendance area encompasses 618.6 square miles, and its boundaries go from the desert 
floor to the top of the mountains, the school buses provide the lifeline between students and the 
schools. The community income is derived mainly from cattle ranch
ing, apple farming, and tourism. 
Many parents commute off the mountain to work in the city since the community has no large 
business or industry. The school district is the largest employer in the community. The population 
has remained fairly constant the 
last few years, although the expectations for future growth, looms 
on the horizon.
 
 

 
Our Mission is... To provide every student success in learning. We are dedicated to the individual 
develop
ment of attitudes, skills, know ledge, and responsibility essential to successful achievement 
in school and society. We actively involve parents and the community in supporting student 
learning and development.
 
 
To Fulfill our Mission... We are committed t
o a strong and comprehensive educational program and 
learning environment which enhances character, provides role models, optimizes each child's 
potential, develops a lifelong love of learning, builds personal responsibility, provides opportunities 
to serv
e, and accentuates individual respect.
 
 
Fundamental to our Mission... Is a commitment to the active involvement of a competent and 
caring staff, teamwork, shared leadership, the effective management of resources, and a safe and 
orderly learning environment
. We pride ourselves on our dedication to our students, families, 
community, each other, our profession, and to continuous learning.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and 
comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic 
system that provides r
eports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are 
publicly accessible (e.g., 
the California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally 
provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of 
operation, the length of time that
 
a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types 
of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the 
SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see t
he CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority:

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education popula
tion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
ali
gned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy t
he requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical
