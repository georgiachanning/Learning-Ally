L
incoln Elementary School is a very high functioning Title I school. We pride ourselves in being rich 
in tradition with a diverse community. Our population consists of 50 percent Hispanic, 34 percent 
white/non
-
Hispanic, 6 percent African
-
American, 5 percent
 
Asian, and 1 percent of each of the 
following; American Indian/Native Alaskan and Asian Indian. We have 30 teachers on staff, 
including 24 full
-
time teachers, three part
-
time music teachers, two full
-
time resource specialist 
program (RSP) teachers, one pa
rt
-
time speech and language specialist, and one school psychologist. 
In addition, we house an active preschool with an AM and PM program. Volunteers are a positive 
force on campus, helping in the classrooms, library, office, at sporting events and special 
activities. 
We work diligently to provide a safe learning environment centered on the California Common Core 

"Mind, Body, and Spirit."
 
 

e believe all students can learn and can become responsible, lifelong 
learners. We set high standards for student achievement and expect all students to achieve. We 
educate for success and are committed to the development of creative thinkers and problem 
s

-
18, Lincoln was the top performing Title I school in the district on the CAASPP. 
This performance ranked Lincoln at 12 in the district, ahead of many non
-
Title I schools.
 
 
We also have improved our Multi
-
Tiered System of Support (MTSS) program to better meet the 
needs of all our students. We employed four part
-
time intervention teachers to provide 
intervention services to the students who need it most.  First thru sixth grad
e deploy for 
intervention at specific times of the day to decrease SPED students being pulled and missing first 
time instruction and to also help us meet the needs of every student at their current level.  The 
main focus in our intervention groups is to ge
t all students reading on grade level as that will affect 
all areas of their education and testing.
 
 
To encourage and motivate our students to perform at their best, we employ a positive behavior 
intervention program (PBIS), focused on teaching our student
s to "ROAR like a Lion." This acronym 
stands for Responsibility, Outstanding Character, Act Safely, and Respect and these are 
characteristics that we intentionally teach and reinforce at school daily.
 
 
In response to recommendations from our parents, Linco
ln made it a priority to acquire more 
technology in order to provide 1:1 access for all our students in grades 3
-
6. This year we will 
accomplish that goal and are also providing increased training to our teachers through our area 
technology specialist.
 
 
La
stly, parent involvement is strong and active at Lincoln. Our PTC is integral to providing the 
resources our students need and help us to provide many family
-
fun, community
-
building events. 
Each year, we host family dances, movie nights, Multi
-
Cultural din
ners, Literacy nights, Social 
Media/Technology nights and more. It is because of the great climate and family
-
feel at Lincoln 
that students enjoy coming to school and staff express their satisfaction.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Matt Verhalen and the Lincoln School Educat
ional Team

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Built in 1984, Lincoln School is 34 years old. With the use of 23 regular classrooms and eight portables, we provide instruct
ion for our nearly 700 students. 
We provide a clean, safe learning environment. Our school 
sits in the center of a well
-
kept campus with a wide variety of trees, shrubs and walkways 
that provide a parklike setting for students. Lincoln Elementary was painted in the summer of 2011 to reflect the school iden
tity. During the summer of 
2012, we had 
new carpet installed throughout the campus, plus added new HVAC units throughout. During the 2017 year, new construction proj
ects 

f
f restrooms, updating the 
library reading area, and adding storage in the office. Every permanent classroom was updated with new projectors with smart 
technology.
 
 
Recent projects completed include upgraded technology in every classroom, installation of be
nches adjacent to the play structure and irrigation upgrades. 
In the summer of 2013, solar panels were installed. This increases the overall energy efficiency on the Lincoln campus. This,
 
in turn, reduces the energy 
consumption for the site. Our library me
dia center houses an exemplary collection of materials. Our technology lab, with a 1:1 student
-
to
-
computer 
ratio, is considered an academic extension of the regular classroom and class mini
-
labs. We have a newly installed Tech Lab with 38 laptops, which ha
ve 
Windows 8 (from the PTC). By the end of the 2018
-
19 school year Lincoln will have 1:1 computers for grades 3
-
6, and will have one computer cart for 
first and second grade to share. Our custodians perform basic cleaning operations daily and maintain the 
grounds and buildings. In addition, we conduct 
deep cleaning twice a year at each site. Our School Attendance Review Team (SART) committee conducts eight clean
-
campus inspections each year. This 
committee of parent inspects the campus grounds and restrooms
 
on a regular basis to provide feedback to our student body.
 
 



-
time pl
ant operations manager who works during the day and a night lead custodian who works in the evenings. 
Graffiti is removed immediately. Through increased community awareness, pride and an open
-
campus policy, we hope to keep vandalism and burglary 
to an all
-
time low. Lincoln just completed the upgrade of our campuswide cameras to high
-
definition quality, and administration and plant operation 
staff can monitor these at home.
 
 
The district believes schools are the hub of their neighborhoods. As a result, we pl
ace a high priority on building and maintaining excellent facilities as 
economically as possible.
 
 
Safety is a No. 1 priority. Students are supervised from 7:45 a.m., 15 minutes prior to the start of school, to 3:10 p.m., th
e end the school day. Students 
p
articipate in cocurricular activities and academic intervention labs before and after school. Credentialed staff teach these 
labs. This year, the After 
School Education and Safety (ASES) program gives students academic assistance from when school lets out 
until 6 p.m.
 
 
All supervising adults wear neon
-
green safety vests to ensure students can clearly find teacher monitors when needed. The supervision schedule is 
revised yearly to address the needs of the students, parents and staff. Students on campus for a
ny other activity must have permission and are supervised 
by their coach or teacher in cocurricular activities, sports or academic interventions.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: 
Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smart
er Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

ho met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated 
in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievem
ent level percentages are calculated using only students who received scores.

The content of staff development is based on Common Core State Standards (CCSS). Professional development reflects school, di
strict and state goals 
for curriculum, assessment, instruction and student 
achievement. Staff development is planned bimonthly at staff meetings. Weekly early release days 
give teachers quality time to plan and collaborate on best practices and continuous improvement strategies for Common Core cu
rriculum. Teachers work 
strategica
lly within professional learning communities to develop best practices, evaluate student
-
learning data, and design lessons to meet the needs 
of the students they serve. Current staff
-
development opportunities include Common Core strategies.
 
 
Professional l

r the 2018

What Is a Good Learner, Goal Setting, Teacher Clarity and knowing thy impact on student learning. Administration will gather 
evidence of tea
cher clarity 
and goal setting through classroom observation and student questioning. The district focused all professional development act
ivities around five 
identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi
-
tiered system of supports,
 
implementation of the California Content Standards and 
NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018
-
19 school year, the district dedicated five professional development days for 
certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional d
evelopment opportunities on staff development days, substitute release days, and on early release 
days. A variety of after

school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.
 
One

Types of Services Funded
 

 
On an annual basis, Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) submits the Application for Funding Consolidated Application and Re
porting System for 
Categorical Aid Programs commonly called CARS. The application is submitted in two (2) parts:  Part I, which con
tains program and demographic 
information, is submitted by June 1 each year; and Part II, which contains the budget information and additional program data
, is submitted by January 
31 each year.  The categorical programs included in the application are Tit
le I, Part A 

 
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged 
Improving, Title I, Part C 

 
Migrant Education, Title II, Part A 

 
Preparing, Training and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals, and Title III 

 
Language Instruction for Limi
ted English Proficient and Immigrant Students.  Essentially, these funds are designed to assist students in mastering state 
standards.
 
 
Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community
.  CUSD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive differences in the lives of the children we all support.  We know from research tha

education will not only bring success to your child but other children 
in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending
 
on the type of categorical 
funding a site may re
ceive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and guidelines.  Such adviso
ry 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each and every s
tudent.  Parental involvement is a necessary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall program.  At the district level, parent committees provide input into each of the 

Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP)

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://
www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
t
s, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.

District Advisory Committ
ee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves as an advisory committee
 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. 
They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs are supplemental education opportunit
ies that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  Th
e SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are 
required to form an ELAC. The ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding ser
vices for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two 
years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall 
be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a D
ELAC representative and arrange to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/gu
ardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) 
currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) elected to serve as the DELAC 

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meet
s four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achievement of our students, comm
unity agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan
 
Native students in grades K 
-
 
12. The program 
assists eligible students to achieve at the same challenging state performance standards expected of all students in grades p
re
-
K

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP a
nnually that works to better align the academic plan with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to 
participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participa
tion of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, District Meetings and 
Community Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share 
their ideas on how CUSD 
ca
n provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in the forums wi


 
 
These forums are designed to provide an opportunit

provide input and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to sha
re new ideas to support 
identifi
ed groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical funding and programs in CUSD.  These funds are further discussed and outlined
 

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 
Gen

ics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economic
ally disadvantaged homes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they have a primary language other than English.  Ch
ildren, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally
 
provided through the base/core curriculum program.  The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Catego
rical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support t
o meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of high quality learning opportunities and access to the co
re curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additiona
l assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom program (base/core curriculum) 
and address any learning gaps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff dev
elopment.   Staff development 
activit
ies are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other staff to challen
ge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
