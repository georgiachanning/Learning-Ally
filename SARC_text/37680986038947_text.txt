Special Education/ISSSchool Accountability Report Card 
for School Year 2018-2019
Published in 2019-2020
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by 
state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The 

SARC contains information about the condition and performance of 

each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula 

(LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a 

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they 

intend to meet annual school-specific goals for all pupils, with specific 

activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported 

in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported in the SARC. . 
 For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC Web page at 
http://www.cde.

ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF 

Web page at 
http://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 

community members should contact the school principal or the district 

office.
DataQuestDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest Web 
page at http://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional informa
-
tion about this school and comparisons of the school to the district, the 

county, and the state. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that 

provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school 

graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding 

English learners.
Internet AccessInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that 
are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the 

Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-

come, first-served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of 

operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 

on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, 

and the ability to print documents.

A. 
 CONDITIONS OF LEARNING (cont.)School Facility Conditions and Planned ImprovementsBelow is information about the safety, cleanliness, and adequacy of school facilities, including the condition 
and cleanliness of the school grounds, buildings, and restrooms. 
This school was opened in 1949.  The condition 
of this school™s buildings, grounds, and restrooms meets the good repair standard as defined in Education Code 

Sections 17014, 17032.5, 17070.75(a).  Recent facility improvements include, but are not limited to: Portable 

building foundation repairs and site drainage repairs.  
(FIT DATED 10/08/19) 
  The district focuses cooperative attention through every department and every employee to ensure that all 
schools are clean, safe, and functional.  The team approach to interdisciplinary problem solving makes Escondido 

Union School District a child-friendly learning environment.
In March 2002, voters in the Escondido community passed Prop K, providing funding to schools for facili
-ties improvements and long-needed projects.  The Independent Citizens Oversight Committee (ICOC) meets 

with District staff regularly to collaborate on projects funded by Prop K, and promotes community involvement 

in the school district initiatives.

each site convenes a School Site Council meeting to review school safety policies in relation to board policy, 
administrative regulations and Education Code. Each school reviews and updates its comprehensive school safety 

plan, and the plans are annually presented and approved by the school district Board. The plans are updated 

using current discipline, attendance, health, and curricular data. The Comprehensive Safe School plan includes 

child abuse reporting procedures, disaster response procedures, suspension and expulsion policies, notification 

for teachers of dangerous pupils policy, discrimination and harassment policies, dress code procedures, safe
