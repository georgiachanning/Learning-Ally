A Message from the Principal:
 
 
Jefferson School represents a true professional learning community. The Jefferson staff works as a 
collective team to support student success and strives to make a positive impact on the community 
of Dinuba.
 
 
 
Jefferson School has shown continuous improve
ment in student achievement through 
the transition to Common Core State Standards in ELA and Math. Jefferson staff believes that:
 
 
Through high quality mathematics instruction and assessment,
 
DUSD students will have the 
mathematics content knowledge, conce
ptual understanding, and problem
-
solving ability to 
succeed
 
in college and career. 
 
Additionally, t
hrough high quality English
-
Language Arts instruction 
and assessment,
 
DUSD students will demonstrate 21st Century Skills and have the reading 
proficiency, wr
iting fluency, and communication skills to succeed
 
in college and career.
 
 
 
Jefferson School has a culture that focuses on student learning and development. The Jefferson 
School staff believes that all students can learn and as such every child should be pr
ovided with 
instruction and learning opportunities focused on attainment of grade level standards. 
 
Our district 
and site academic coaches continue to assist teachers in Math, English Language Arts, and English 
Language Development. Grade
-
level collaborati
on days make it possible for teams of teachers at 
each grade level to work with administration and academic coaches to improve teaching and 
learning at Jefferson Elementary. Staff training activities focus on: Common Core math strategies, 
key standards to 
be taught in language arts and math, instruction for English Learners, student 
engagement structures, and common assessments. 
 
 
 
Jefferson has identified a few high leverage, key actions that will be taken to provide high
-
quality, 
rigorous ELA and Math in
struction. 
 
They are:
 
 

 

 

 
Focus on academic support for students who are at risk of failing. Use intervention 
materials to continue strategic and intensive interventions for targeted students during 
the school day.
 

 
Provide specific instruction for our English learners at the abi
lity level appropriate for each 
student.
 

 
Continue providing preschool services to our community.
 

 
Use instructional technologies to enhance student learning and engagement.
 

 
Continue to develop our Professional Learning Community to focus on learning, results, 
and collaboration.
 

 
Provide more parent engagement opportunities.
 
 
 
 
The Jefferson staff understands the importance of community involvement. 
 
Teachers supervise 
stud
ents in community activities such as the Raisin Day parade, Christmas Parade, Cinco De Mayo 
Parade, Youth Night in the Park and our school carnival. The community also supports Jefferson in 
many ways. 
 
Volunteers from a local church help at school events, 
organize community work days, 
and read with students on a weekly basis.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca

Note: Percentages are not calculated when the number of students tested is ten or

statistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: ELA and mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative 

calculated by taking the 
total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total numbe

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parent participation 
is of critical importance to the continued growth and well
-
being of our students. Parents are active on campus and support our 
programs through classroom volunteer efforts, the School Site Council (SSC), the English Learner Advisory Council (ELAC), and
 
the
 
Parent Teacher 
Organization (PTO). Our SSC, which includes parent members, approves our annual school plan. Annually, Jefferson invites pare
nts to the Title I Parent 
Involvement Meeting to share with the parents and community how Jefferson is performing a
s a school. With training from Parenting Partners, our staff 
and several parents have joined together to provide a six
-
week collaborative workshop. 
 
Jefferson's Parent Teacher Organization continues to maintain 
a strong presence on campus. 
 
The purpose of 
the PTO is to provide support to students throughout their educational career at Jefferson. 
 
They help at 
school events and hold various activities throughout the year to involve students. 
 
The school is also fortunate to have a local church providing supp
ort 
to the students and staff. 
 
The Dinuba Mennonite Brethren Church has helped in a number of ways. 
 
They have supplied volunteers to help at school 
events, organized members to come weekly to read with students, and have even organized community work day
s where students, parents, school staff, 
and church members joined together to tackle some beautification projects on campus.

Activities, please contact Rita Navarro, Community Liaison at 559

School Safety Plan
 
The Jefferson Elementary comm
unity supports our efforts to ensure a safe campus. Staff members monitor our campus before and after school, and 
during recess. The goals of our school safety plan are to maintain a clean, safe, campus; to keep all students and staff emot
ionally and physi
cally safe; to 
maintain strong school
-
home relationships with positive, consistent, and frequent formal and informal lines of communication; and to maximize 
instructional time by minimizing classroom disruptions. The school has implemented Positive Behavio
r Interventions and Supports to encourage students 
to make wise choices and perform up to their ability at school.
 
 
 
The school website provides information to students and parents. 
 
The Safe School Plan 
is updated and approved annually by the School Site 
Council.
 
 
Some of the areas of safety which remain a concern for parents and staff are busy 
intersections in front of the school as well as limited drop off locations. Several maintenance projects were completed to en
hance the security of the 
school. 
 
For 
instance, additional fencing was installed.
