About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructio
nal Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
A District committee considers textbooks for recommendation on a cycle established by the State Board of Education and from a
 
State adopted list.  The 
committee meets to discuss current issues relevant to the subject mat
ter, including student success, previously used textbooks, and instructional 
methods.  The committee reviews demonstration copies of proposed textbooks, as well as listen to representatives describe the
 
various highlights of the 
available materials.  The r
eview is followed by a pilot of materials that results in consensus by the committee of a recommended textbook.  The textbook
 
is forwarded to a K
-
12 Curriculum Council, which consists of teachers, parents, and community stakeholders, for review and approva
l.  If the textbook is 
approved by the K
-
12 Curriculum Council, the textbook is forwarded to the Superintendent and the Governing Board for their review and approval.
  
Each 
pupil in the district, including English learners, kindergarten through grade twelv
e, is provided with standards
-
aligned textbooks or basic instructional 
materials that are consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framework adopted by the State Board.
 
 
AB 1246, added Education Code Section 60210, which allows the district
 
to use any instructional materials, not just state
-
adopted, as long as they are 
aligned with the academic content standards.  The EC 60119 has a new section (e) with a reference to the Common Core State St
andards (CCSS).  The 

pose of transitioning to instructional materials that are aligned with the common core academic content standards, it is the 
intent of the Legislature that textbooks, instructional materials, and supplemental instructional materials be deemed to be a
ligned
 
with the content 
standards pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (c), and be deemed consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framew
ork adopted by the state 
board pursuant to subdivision (a) if the textbooks, instructional materials, supplementa
l instructional materials, or a combination of any such materials 

ed to either the 1997 
standards or the 2010 CCSS standards for ma
thematics and English Language Arts are compliant with Williams Act requirements.  In accordance with 
Education Code Section 60422(a) and 60119, the Governing Board certified on 9/3/2019 that each pupil in the district, includi
ng English learners, in 
kinde
rgarten through grade twelve, has been provided with standards
-
