John R. Peterson School is a community K
-
5 elementary school located in the southeastern section of Huntington Beach. Peterson follows 
a traditional school
-
year schedule. It was built on a fifteen acre site o
riginally opened in 1963. The Jack K. Clapp wing was added in 1977 
to accommodate the district's special education students. Due to declining enrollment throughout the district, the site was c
losed to 
elementary students in 1981. As a result of increasing 
population and the implementation of the class size reduction program, Peterson 
was reopened in 1997 after being renovated for the twenty
-
first century at a cost of $2.3 million which provided full site cabling and 
internet capabilities, phone systems with
 
voice mail in each classroom, upgraded electrical systems, renovated fields, paint, carpet, tile, 
remodeled offices, furnishings, and equipment. The site houses seven programs. The regular education program serves children 
who 
reside in the immediate area
; the Specialized Academic Instruction (SAI) program serves Kindergarten through fifth grade students 
identified as needing academic, social, and behavioral support; the Gifted and Talented Education centered program serves chi
ldren 
identified as gifted an
d talented who reside throughout the district; the Title I program provides intervention opportunities to low 
performing students to close the achievement gap; the English Learner (EL) program provides language development for students
 
who 
are second langu
age learners; and our preschool program, a fee
-
based program, that prepares three and four year old children for 
kindergarten. The school's population includes students from diverse ethnicities. Categorical funding includes Title I. Speci
al Education 
resou
rces on site include Speech and Language, Specialized Academic Instruction (SAI) and our K
-
2 Special Day Class. Peterson is fortunate 
to have an active PTA of over 725 members and over 18,000 hours of volunteer time each year. PTA is devoted to classroom a
ssistance 
and providing supplemental programs such as the Whale Tales Incentive Reading Program, Accelerated Reader(AR), 100 Mile Club,
 
enrichment assemblies, and Standards aligned field trips for every child. Peterson also has the distinction of National 
PTA recognition as 
a "Parent Involvement School of Excellence". Peterson's mission and values statements were mutually developed and provide the
 
foundation for our shared decision making. The Peterson staff is committed to maintaining our school as a Profe
ssional Learning 
Community (PLC), in which all teachers collaborate regularly to discuss and analyze student assessment data and develop commo
n 
instructional methods to ensure the academic success of all students. In 2000, Peterson earned recognition as an
 
Honorable Mention for 
California Distinguished School. Peterson subsequently earned the honor of being named a California Distinguished School in 2
004, 2008, 
and 2010.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law 
to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to 
prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
con
sistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (Scho

Parents and the community are very supportive of the educational programs at Peterson School. Each year more than 18,000 hour
s of volunteer time 
are given to the various PTA sponsored fundraising activities and service projects to support 
the visual arts program, Beach Clean
-
Up, Family Dinner 
Nights, Movie Nights, Fall Festival, and the Accelerated Reading and Whale Tales incentive reading programs. PTA also provide
s financial allocations for 
curriculum related assemblies, technology acquis
ition, classroom supplies, and field trips for each class. In addition, the PTA sponsors and operates the 
100 Mile Club which encourages students and their families to run/walk each morning before school. Over 85% of Peterson stude
nts participate in this 
p
rogram on our campus which supports a healthy lifestyle and starting the day with exercise.
 
 
Peterson is a PTA Parent Involvement School of Excellence by meeting a variety of criteria in areas such as communication, vo
lunteerism, parenting, 
student learnin
g, school decision making, advocacy, collaboration with the community, and parent and family involvement. We are proud of the
 
accomplishments of our PTA members. PTA membership has grown to over 710 members with two local businesses becoming Gold Memb
ers o
f the PTA.
 
 
Peterson School created a community partnership program in 2006
-
07 entitled Partners in Progress that has achieved great success. The program creates 
$250 scholarships for each classroom in which teachers may use for supplies, materials, and sp
ecific unit resources to support instruction. We are thankful 
for their support. More information regarding sponsorships are available by calling the school office at 714
-

The Huntington Beach Assistance League also provides generous grants to ou
r teachers to support and encourage implementation of hands
-
on learning

As a Title I school, we have crafted a Parent Involvement P
olicy that is reviewed yearly by teacher and parent groups and then approved by our Peterson 
School Site Council. A copy of this policy is available on our John R. Peterson Elementary School website:

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: 
 
The involvement of parents and community members is an essential component of nurturing students. Every effort to invite and 
consider parent and 
community input wa
s made to ensure the success of our students. A team of parents, teachers and administrators developed the following 
school/parent/community involvement policy.
 
 
Parental involvement means the participation of parents in regular, two
-
way, and meaningful co
mmunication involving student academic learning and 
other school activities, including ensuring
-
 
 

 
that parents play an integral role in assisting their child's learning;
 

 
that parents are encouraged to be actively involved in their child's education at scho
ol;
 

 
that parents are full partners in their child's education and are included, as appropriate, in decision
-
making and are on advisory committees 
to assist in the education of their child.
 
Information about school policies and involvement opportunities are
 
communicated through direct parent contact in the following manner: 
 

 
The School Parent/Community Involvement Policy and School
-
Parent Compact are distributed to parents and students in the Home and 
School Agreement, which is distributed annually during Pa
rent
-
Teacher Conferences to all students and their parents. Teachers review the 
Home and School Agreement and policies with the students during the period of Parent
-
Teacher Conferences. The Home and School 
Agreement (Parent Compact) is a part of the School
 
Parent Involvement Policy. The compact was developed by teachers, parents, and 
administrators. It describes the responsibilities of the school and parents to improve student performance and the means in w
hich to do 
so. Parents are asked to read and discus
s the Home and School Agreement with their children and sign and return an acknowledgment 
form.
 

 
Peterson Elementary School notifies parents about the School Parental Involvement Policy in an understandable and uniform for
mat and, to 
the extent practicable,
 
distributes this policy to parents in a language the parents can understand.
 

 
Peterson Elementary School makes the School Parental Involvement Policy available to the local community through the followin
g sources:

Peterson Elementary School believes a student's academic, social, and emotional needs can only be met when parents and school
 
staff work together in 
the best interest of the student. Communication is key to that success.
 
 
State Priority: 
School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehens
ive Safe School Plan was developed by the district to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The plan provides student
s and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 
within their safe school plans: 
current status and assessment of school crime; identification of strategies and programs that provide and maintain a high lev
el of school safety; child 
abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; 
policies related to suspension and expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual 
harassment and discrimination policy; policies and procedures for the prevention of bullying; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and 
egress of pupils, parents, 
and school employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and makes any modifications as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Sa
fe School Plan, were 
reviewed with sch
ool and district staff at the beginning of the 2019
-
20 school year. The plan was reviewed and updated with staff and School Site Council 
in early 2020. The plan included both reactive and proactive school response to emergency and safety situations involvi
ng students and staff. The plan is 
based on the Incident Command System (ICS). Staff receives on
-
going training on professional development days, as well as through the school's web
-
based School Safety & Emergency Response Program: Hour

A school safety committee, comprised of both certificated and classified staff, parents and the principal, meets regularly du
ring the school year to review 
school safety and current concerns for improvement in the res
ponse to safety issues. The school safety committee also makes 
requests/recommendations to the district safety committee regarding safety and emergency response issues affecting the entire
 
district.
 
 
The district progressively addresses structural needs at
 
each school to ensure facilities are safe and comply with education codes as well as building and 
safety regulations. One automated external defibrillator (AED) was installed in the administration building. A $169 million b
ond (Measure Q) approved 
in Nove
mber 2016 provides the necessary funding for District
-
 
wide modernization efforts.  Permanent campus perimeter fencing was completed during 
Winter 2019 to increase student safety.

ict regularly collaborates with all levels of district 
and school site staff when developing professional development activities in alignment with Common Core State Standards. Inst
ructional program 
improvement is driven by student needs and guided by state
 
standards. District and school administrators use site trend analyses, state testing, district
-
