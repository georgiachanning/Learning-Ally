By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Elementary School is located in Whittier City, a quaint suburb 12 miles southeast of Los 
Angeles.  Our partnership of dedicated
 
teachers, staff, parents, and community members strive to serve as role models 
and empower our students to become life
-
long learners and productive citizens. During the 2018
-
19 school year, twenty
-
four full
-
time teachers, Transitional Kindergarten through
 
Grade Five, provide instruction to approximately 560 students, 
15% of which are English Language Learners. All Longfellow School teachers are highly qualified. Our teaching faculty is 
comprised of 19 General Education teachers, one Resource Specialist (RS
P) and four Special Day Teachers (SDC).  Our 
students benefit from additional school staffing which includes: one part
-
time school counselor, one part
-
time speech 
pathologist, one part
-
time school psychologist, one full
-
time instructional coach and one par
t
-
time community liaison.
 
 
At the heart of our instructional initiatives is the full implementation of the Common Core State Standards in particular 
English Language Arts and Mathematics, Positive Behavioral Intervention System, and 21st Century Skills. Al
l students 
have access to instructional materials aligned with the expectations of the California State Standards. For the foundation 
of literacy development, we are using a Balanced Literacy approach such as Interactive Real Aloud, Shared Reading, and 
Wri
ters Workshop. Eureka Math is the curriculum used in all of our K
-
5 classrooms, and it is intended to support students 
in the development of concrete skills, to representational, to abstract. In addition, Longfellow is implementing Leader In 
Me. It is a wh
ole school transformation process. It teaches 21st century leadership and life skills to students and creates 
a culture of student empowerment based on the idea that every child can be a leader.
 
 
Longfellow School's mission is to ensure that all students l
earn the academic standards and social skill necessary to succeed 
in their next level of education.  Teachers, staff, parents, and the community will work collaboratively to educate, support 
and challenge our students in a safe and nurturing environment.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State prior
ity: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents and other community members are integral partners in accomplishing our school vision and mission. We believe 
that through these partnerships, all children will acquire the foundations of an enriching education and the social qualities
 
and character
 
traits needed to be responsible citizens and contributing members in our society.  Our school welcomes and 
encourages parents to visit, volunteer, attend parent education sessions and to provide input for decision
-
making.
 
 
Along with parent committees and
 
councils (i.e., School Site Council, PTA, and ELAC), there are myriad school events that 
parents can volunteer and attend. Parents also have the opportunity to attend our yearly Harvest Festival in the fall, our 
Family Night in the spring, the Read Across
 
America Community Read
-
in, PAWS Parent Workshops, Technology Days,  
student orientations, guided tours, Back to School Night, Trimester Awards ceremonies, Student of the Month assemblies, 
Winter program, Coffee with the Principal, and more.
 
 
To further en
hance our parental engagement, this year we are training a Parent Leadership Team comprised of school 
personnel and parents to server as a forum to discuss, brainstorm and give input on ways to positively impact student 
achievement and improve their child'
s educational experience.  Finally, Longfellow Elementary School houses the District's 
Parent Room, where DELAC, ELAC, parenting classes, and other parent meetings take place.  Throughout the school year, 
a variety of parent education sessions are offered 
with our partnership with Pro Whittier.  Topics are selected based on 
an annual parent needs assessment conducted at School Site Council and ELAC meetings.  The topics range in scope but 
are appropriate for parents of elementary school children.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
In addition to providing an enriching educational experience, Longfellow is committed to the safety and security of each 
student. To maintain these conditions which contribute to the best possible learning environment, the School Safety Plan 
includes the f
ollowing elements:
 
1.
 
School Crime Assessment: Longfellow provides compiled school crime information each month for the California 
Safe School Assessment as mandated by the State of California. This information is analyzed at each school site to 
determine wha
t steps may be taken to reduce incidents of crime.
 
2.
 
Child Abuse Reporting: Teachers and other school employees are required by law to report any cases of suspected 
child abuse or child neglect. Reports are investigated by the Department of Social Services t
o determine if any 
follow
-
up on the report is necessary.
 
3.
 
Disaster Procedures: In order to ensure the safety of students and school personnel, the school safety committee 
has created a comprehensive Disaster Preparedness Plan which is reviewed on a 
yearly basis.
 
4.
 
School Discipline/Character Development: Longfellow has embraced the Positive Behavioral Intervention System 
program in order to support our school
-
wide discipline plan and character development. Through the lessons 
embedded in the program we
 
hope to communicate high standards/expectations and to hold students 
accountable for their behavior. The P.A.W.S. (Perseverance, Are always responsible, Work and play safely, and 
Show respect) is given to every student and reviewed in student assemblies a
nd daily teacher lessons. Staff 
members consistently enforce the school
-
wide standards.
 
5.
 
Procedures to Notify Teachers of Dangerous Pupils: If a student is deemed dangerous because of behavior at 
school or behavior outside of school which has been dealt wit
h by county juvenile authorities, the teacher(s) of 
the student will be promptly notified of the status of the student.
 
6.
 
Sexual Harassment Policy: Longfellow strictly adheres to district policies which prohibit sexual harassment or 
discrimination of any kin
d. The sexual harassment policy is distributed to each student at the beginning of the 
school year, and employees are advised of their duty to take prompt action if they become aware of any incidents 
of sexual harassment.
 
7.
 
School
-
wide Dress Code: Longfellow
 
believes that a clearly defined dress code contributes to a positive school 
environment. The primary standards for student dress and grooming include that the student should be neat and 
clean at school, and the student should not wear clothing that compro
mises safety or modesty or that is disruptive 
to the educational process. To this end, Longfellow School has a uniform policy for all students. Parents may 
request a uniform waiver request prior to the start of school.
 
8.
 
Safe and Orderly Environment: Longfel
low believes a safe and orderly environment is necessary to ensure a 
positive learning experience for all students. Regular supervision of students is the core of creating and 
maintaining a safe and orderly environment. Teachers, administrators, campus sup
ervisors and parent volunteers 
consistently supervise and interact with students to reinforce behavioral expectations and safety standards.
 
 
Teachers follow a supervision schedule before school and for recess duty on the playground, helping ensure that 
pla
yground rules are adhered to for student safety at all times. During lunch, Longfellow has four noon
-
duty aides that 
monitor student safety.
 
 
Emergency Situations
 
 
This comprehensive plan has been developed to address various emergency situations. It is ou
r belief that students can 
only thrive when they feel safe from everything from earthquakes to bullies. Parents and staff members work together to 
identify potential hazards and take preventive measures. Regular practice drills of emergency procedures make
 
safety a 
routine and allow us to get on with the business of education.
 
 
The safety plan was reviewed, updated and discussed with the faculty at the Opening Staff Meeting on August 12, 2019. 
We continuously revisit and update our school plan as we practic
e our drills throughout the year.

Finally, a strong partnership exists between our school and local law enforcement. Local law enforcement agencies provide 
ongoing support to the school and coordinates with school and district personnel to ensure students
 
safety in case of a 
campus or neighborhood threat.
