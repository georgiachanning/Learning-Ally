By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Del Vista Math & Science Academy was one of the first schools built in Delano. The school is located in a residential 
neighborhood th
at includes both single
-
family homes and apartment buildings. Our site houses a preschool, 35 
classrooms, cafeteria, office, resource room, computer lab, fitness lab, and library. We teach, practice, and promote a safe 
learning environment and positive soc
ial behavior with the help of a Multi
-
Tiered System of Support (MTSS). District and 
school staff takes great pride in ensuring our classrooms and grounds are clean, safe, functional, and free of dangerous 
objects. All classrooms, bathrooms, and offices are
 
cleaned daily and repairs are made in a timely manner. A work order 
process called School Dude is used to ensure efficient service.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress 
[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or
 
programs 
of study.

Del Vista Math & Science Academy Parent Involvement Policy
 
 
This policy has been jointly developed and agreed upon by Del Vista Math & Science Academy (DVMSA) staff and parents 
of students served in the school pursuant to Title I.
 
 
Del Vista Math & 

achievement is enhanced through meaningful parent involvement. In order to fulfill the Title I, Part A parental involvement 
requirements, to the extent prac
ticable, Del Vista Math & Science Academy will provide full opportunities for the 
participation of all parents, including the parents of English learners, parents with disabilities, and parents of migratory 
children. The school will provide information and
 
reports required under section 1111 of the ESEA in an understandable 
and uniform format, including alternative formats upon request and, to the extent practicable, in a language parents 
understand. Del Vista Math & Science Academy educates students from c
ulturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. 
The majority of students are also from socio
-
economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Thus, the stakeholders in our 
school recognize the importance of parent and family involvement to the education of our ch
ildren. 
 
 
Del Vista Math & Science Academy will take the following actions to involve parents and families in the education of their 
children:
 

 
Convene an annual Title 1 Meeting to inform parents of the requirements of Title 1 and of their right to be 
invol
ved.
 

 
Offer a flexible number of meetings and may provide under this part, child care, or home visits as such services 
related to parental involvement.
 

 
Involve parents in an organized, ongoing and timely way in the planning, review and improvement of the Ti
tle 
1 program and parent involvement policy.
 

 
Provide parents with an explanation of the curriculum, academic assessment, and proficiency levels students 
are expected to meet
 

 
Provide parents, if requested, with opportunities for regular meetings to particip
ate in decisions relating to the 
education of their children
 

 
Maintain an active School Site Council involved in the planning, designing, implementing, reviewing, and 

strict. This School Site

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety Plan was reviewed with staff on July 25, 2019.
 
 
Student and Staff safety are a priority at Del Vista Math & Science Academy. The school safety plan is reviewed, amended, 
and approved on a yearly basis. Site specific information is updated prior to the beginning of every school year and 
reviewed with sta
ff. In August, a safety week is held to review and practice drills for fire, earthquake, lockdowns, 
evacuations, etc. Monthly drills are also held to remind student and staff of proper safety procedures. This plan includes 
identification of the appropriate
 
strategies and programs to provide or maintain a high level of school safety and addresses 


xisting laws related to school safety. The plan is based on the assessment of 
the current status of school crimes committed on the campus and school related functions. It includes school climate, 
physical environment, child abuse reporting, disaster proced
ures, disciplinary procedures, ensuring a safe and orderly 
environment, and procedures for a safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and staff. A code blue team is established 
yearly to be trained on the use of an AED.
