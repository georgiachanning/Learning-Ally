About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a Sch
ool Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local 
Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with dat
a reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about 
the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or
 
the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most 
Recent Year)
 
Cobblestone Elementary School is a beautiful facility. Built twenty eight 
years ago, it is aesthetically pleasing as well as bei
ng an excellent 
environment for student learning.   The school and grounds are well 
maintained. Modernization of the campus is being planned for the near 
future.  Classrooms are regularly cleaned and checked for safety hazards. 
District
-
wide safety inspect
ions are done on an ongoing basis throughout 
the year. Cobblestone has a comprehensive safety and crisis intervention 
plan. School personnel supervise and monitor students before and after 
school as well as during all non
-
instructional times. Primary stude
nts use 
the buddy system whenever they leave the classroom. All campus guests 
check in at the office before proceeding to classrooms and wear visitor 
badges. Cobblestone is a safe, well maintained school of which students, 
staff and parents are proud.
 
 
The
 
district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, 
and functional.  To assist in this effort, the district uses a facility survey 
instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School 
Construction.  District mainten
ance ensures that the repairs necessary to 
keep the school sites in good repair and working order are completed in a 
timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service 
and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in 
the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of 
the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully comp
leted courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for 
Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parent and community involvement is vital to the success of our school.  Goals for parents are published in the school handbo
ok and  participation is 
strongly encouraged with a volunteer fair occurring at our Welc
ome Back Picnic.  We provide many opportunities for involvement.  Trained parent 
volunteers provide monthly art lessons to each class through our school Art Docent program.  Parents run special events such 
as our Mini
-
Olympics and 
evening family events.   
Fundraising efforts like our annual Jogathon, and Scrip sales are other ways parents are involved.  Cobblestone boasts over 1
50 
people volunteering each year as guest speakers, classroom helpers and cafeteria supervisors, field trip chaperones, clerical
 
as
sistants or library 
volunteers.  Site Council, and the Parent Teacher Club Board as well as the Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support Lea
dership Team, LCAP advisory 
committee and Strategic Planning team provide leadership opportunities for parents.
  
Cobblestone enjoys community support through sponsorship from 
local businesses and civic organizations.  Our annual Volunteer Tea recognizes and thanks all those for their involvement.  C

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC
 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Student safety is a top concern. Acco
rding to the most recent California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS), 93% of Cobblestone students feel safe at school.  
Our comprehensive safety plan includes collaboration with the Rocklin Fire Marshal and Police Department.  Together, we have 
revised our emerg
ency 
evacuation routes and conduct monthly drills for practice. Our plan includes the nineth year of implementing Second Step whic
h focuses on problem 
solving, anger management and impulse control across all grades.  All students participate in digital cit
izenship lessons that include cyber safety as we 
increase the the use of technology in the classroom as well as a schoolwide Bully
-
Prevention Curriculum.   In 2016, we implemented schoolwide Positive 
Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS) to provide s
ocial, behavioral and emotional support for students who have additional needs in these areas.  
All students know and are recognized for following the Cobblestone Cougar Code where they consider their behavior in terms of
 
making good decisions, 
showing res
pect and solving problems.
