District Vision
 
As a community of learners, the Santa Monica
-
Malibu Unified School District works together in a 
nurturing environment to help students be visionary, versatile thinkers; resourceful, life
-
long 
learners; 
effective, multilingual communicators and global citizens.  We are a rich, culturally diverse 
community that values the contributions of all its members and strives to promote social justice.  
We exist to assist all students in their pursuit of academic ac
hievement, strength of character, and 
personal growth, and to support them in their exploration of the intellectual, artistic, technological,

Roosevelt Elementary School: Shared Vision and Mission Statement
 
 
Shared 
Vision
 
We are an inclusive community that inspires and empowers all learners to pursue excellence with 
compassion and integrity.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
Roosevelt is a diverse community that values each individual. We are dedicated to using best 
practices to en
gage students to become enthusiastic, lifelong learners and confident global citizens. 
We cultivate academic achievement, positive character traits,and independent, creative thinking. 
With kindness, trust, and respect, we set high expectations and commit t
o bringing out the best in 
ourselves and others.
 
 
Lastly, at Roosevelt we pride ourselves in our professional growth. Teachers and staff at Roosevelt 
contract with staff developers for regular professional development workshops at our school site 
in UCLA C


Teachers College. This affords us additional on
-
site training by staff developers
 
form Columbia 
University. By integrating this training with professional protocols such as Learning Walk and Lesson 
Link, our Roosevelt team works collaboratively to provide the best possible instruction for all our 
students. Our signature practices of CG
I and Reading and Writing Workshop have earned us our 
second Distinguished School Award during the 2013
-
14 school year.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The S
ARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), whic
h describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more informati
on about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Plan
ned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Roosevelt provides a safe, clean and positive learning environment for students, staff and volunteers. School gates are secur
ed during the day. School 
facilities are up
-
to
-
date and provide adequate space for students and
 

classrooms and campus grounds are kept clean and safe. Students and staff demonstrate Roosevelt pride in their school and hav
e been most successful 
in their efforts to impro
ve our campus environment. Our school is well maintained and in very good condition. We are proud that our school district 
takes great efforts to ensure that our school is clean, safe and functional. There are no emergency needs as defined by the O
ffice of
 
Public School 
Construction. During school hours, each teacher has his or her own classroom space to provide instruction and may arrange the
 
rooms accordingly.
 
 
There is a separate kindergarten yard designed to meet their developmental needs. Our main 
playground yard is used by first through fifth graders. We 
have two separate recess times and three lunch periods to limit the number of students on the yard at one time. The school co
nsists of 41 classrooms 
including nine portable classrooms. In addition,
 
we have an auditorium, cafeteria, a library, two computer labs and athletic fields. The school facility is 
considered a shared space to support student learning. After
-
school programs share some of these same classrooms and are also given the space needed
 
to effectively run their programs. The library, cafeteria and auditorium are also used for several of the enrichment classes.
 
Both yards are also utilized by 
the after
-
school programs. School staff utilizes the school library twice a month for professiona
ldevelopment purposes on Wednesday mornings when 
the space is not used for students.
 
 
The school recently received new upgrades with new window, paint and flooring. We were also able to address leaking gutters a
nd roofs. With the 
infusion of operational do
llars we will continue to address deferred maintenance issues.

School Safety Plan
 
Roosevelt teachers and 
students are trained in conflict resolution (Cool Tools) and bullying prevention (Olweus). Cool Tools is a conflict
-
mediation 
program that teaches students skills and strategies to use when they encounter difficult situations. Each year students recei
ve in
struction from the 
classroom teacher on the Cool Tools language. School staff facilitates mediation of conflict between students using the Cool 
Tools philosophy. The 
discipline plan and Cool Tools work in conjunction with each other. An additional way that
 
we teach and reinforce positive behavior is through the 
Character Development Book of the Month Program.
 
 
For the past two years, all staff and students have been implementing the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program, which we call S
tand by Me: Together We 
Can Make a Difference. This is a research
-
based bullying prevention program that has been proven to reduce bullying and is recognized by the U.S. 
Department of Education. The goals of the program are to reduce bullying, improve overall school climate, and 
build stronger relationships among all 
students and the overall school community. This schoolwide program includes all members of the Roosevelt community including 
teachers, students, 
staff and parents. Parent volunteers are required to receive Cool Tools 
Training and Stand By Me Training every two years in order to volunteer in the 
classroom or on the yard. In partnership with Santa Monica Police Department, our fifth
-
grade students participate in the Drug Abuse Resistance 
Education (D.A.R.E.) program whic
h teaches students good decision
-
making skills to help them lead safe and healthy lives.
 
 
All students and parents reviewed and signed the Citizenship Handbook at the beginning of the year. The handbook includes rul
es of the playground and 
the school commu
nity that helps to keep students safe. Supervision on the yard is available before and after school for 15 minutes. There are
 
assigned 
faculty members each day to monitor student safety. During school hours, students are supervised by their classroom teach
ers while inside their 
classrooms. During recess, teachers are assigned duty on the playground to ensure student safety. During lunch, instructional
 
aides and staff monitor 
student safety in the cafeteria and outside play areas.
 
 
The administrators monitor
 
these areas during lunch supervision. All yard
-
duty supervisors wear orange safety vests to ensure that students can easily 
recognize adult helpers on the yard. In addition to wearing the orange safety vests, yard
-
duty supervisors are all equipped with wh
istles, a staff safety 
folder that contains nurse

s slips and an overview of safety rules. During the school day, all persons must check in through the office. Only one entran
ce 
is open during school hours. Campus visitors check in at the office and wear b
adges to identify themselves. Play and drop
-
off areas are monitored before 
and after school and all recess times. If students require supervision earlier than 15 minutes before or after school, we hav
e several options available:
 

 
Primary and Upper CREST Chi
ld Care programs service students from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. There are lead teachers assigned to each of these 
programs.
 

 
Playground Access: This program is available for students in grades 1
-
5 to use the playground after school until 5:15 p.m.
 

 
Enrichment Progra
ms: There are numerous enrichment classes offered throughout the week in which students can participate. Applications 
for these sessions are sent at least four weeks prior to the beginning of the program.
 

 
Homework Club: The program is available after schoo
l from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. for grades 1
-
3 and from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. for grades 4
-
5. These 
students meet in the library and cafeteria.
 
The School Safety Plan was last reviewed, updated, and discussed with the school faculty in October 2016.
