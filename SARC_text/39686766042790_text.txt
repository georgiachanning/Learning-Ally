About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report C
ard (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LC
FF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional 
Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes fo
r all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California c
ontent standards calls for. This information is far more meaningful when along with 

mes of the textbooks used 
in our core classes a
nd their dates of publication.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

however, the number of students tested is not

resolve the emergency and safely secure or evacuate the students, based upon the site and district emergency preparedness pla
ns. A site review with 
the district Internal Evaluation Instrument (IEI) occurs annually. A comprehensive School Safety
 
Plan, which was updated on August, 2019 by the REMS 
Team (Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools) and Administration is annually reviewed by the School Site Council and 
helps to provide a 
secure, peaceful, and a clean environment for the school co

emergencies and natural disasters. Emergency drills are conducted on a regular basis. Every effort is made to ensure student 
movement and transitions 
are monitored whil
e students are on campus throughout the school day. Yard supervisors, teachers, site administrators and school staff provide 
supervision for students before, during, and after school. The playground is safe for all students. All visitors must sign in
 
at th
e office and receive proper 
authorization to be on campus, and must display their passes at all times.  Van Buren has 2 full time counselors and a Mental
 
Health Clinician twice a 
week for counseling services.
