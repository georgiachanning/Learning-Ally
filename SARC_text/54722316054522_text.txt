School Description
 
Principal's Message: Named after President Woodrow Wilson, our school opened its doors to the 
public in 1920. As the oldest school in the district, members of our school community take great 
pride in the fact that many of Tulare's most notable citizens att
ended Wilson. The list of famous 
alumni include: Admiral Elmo Zumwalt Jr., former Chief of U.S. Naval Operations; Two
-
time Olympic 
Gold Medalist and U.S. Congressman, Bob Mathias; Olympic Gold Medalist Sim Iness; and two
-
time 
winner of the Kremer Prize for
 
human
-
powered flight and pilot of the first human
-
powered flight 
across the English Channel, Bryan Allen.
 
 
The mission of Wilson School is to provide all Warriors with a balanced education based on the 
virtues of developing strong moral character and 
creative problem solving skills for life. Through 
the delivery of rigorous curriculum, caring support, and assistance provided by the members of our 
school community, we are committed to closing the opportunity gap. Involvement in activities that 
will ulti
mately empower our student's freedom of choice as they explore future college and career 
opportunities, guides our actions. To ensure a bright and healthy future for all members of the 
Warrior Nation is our passion and our legacy.
 
 
The Warrior staff consis
ts of 24 classroom teachers, one principal, one administrative intern, two 
RTI teachers, and one RSP instructor, who address the academic and social needs of students in 
grades TK through fifth. Staff and students receive supplemental support and assistanc
e from 12 
part
-
time instructional aides, one library aide, one full time and one part
-
time secretary, two 
custodians, and three lunch servers. Wilson School serves as a preschool program site. Operated 
by the district, the program maintains two teachers an
d four instructional aides. Preschool offers 
two classroom sessions (morning and afternoon).
 
 
The staff of Wilson School is dedicated to improving the academic performance of each student. 
Designated as an AVID Showcase School, we continue to explore and i
mplement measures 
designed to increase student achievement. In addition to extensive AVID training and school
-
wide 
planning, all teachers are actively involved in the Instructional Rounds process. Guided by a 
strategic approach to the analysis of data and 
planning, staff members are dedicated to improving 
their ability to identify materials and strategies that best suit the individual needs of our students.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountabi
lity Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Ac
countability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in 
the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, s

page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district offic

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Maintaining a safe and orderly learning environment for all members of the Wilson school community is an ongoing process. Thi
s process involves 
adherence to safety procedures and the maintenance of a "user friendly" school facility. Guided by the elements 
found within the Comprehensive School 
Safety Plan and Crisis Management Plan, all members of the Wilson staff and student body take part in regularly scheduled eva
cuation drills. In addition 
to conducting an annual review of safety procedures, the site adm
inistrator and selected staff members review and revise campus supervision plans 
[before, during, and after school] once a trimester.
 
 
To better ensure the safety and well
-
being of our students and colleagues, a member of the faculty serves as Wilson Schoo
l's site representative at district 
sponsored, monthly Cal
-
OSHA meetings. In turn, this representative provides updates to staff on safety and health related issues. The Wilson campus 
is 
maintained in a manner that is supportive of a positive learning expe
rience. Classrooms are clean and provide a safe environment in which students and 
teachers can work. Our cafeteria serves as a multipurpose facility for both food service and large
-
scale events or meetings. Several modifications were 
made to the Wilson Lib
rary in 2010. Built in 1942, the library now houses a mini
-
computer lab, all new shelving, and new student furniture. In 2013, 
Wilson School benefited from a cooperative effort between the school district and the City of Tulare, to install a pedestrian
 
cro
ssing system in front of 
school on Tulare Avenue. Additional campus improvements made between 2014 and 2019 have included the following: 1) Relocating
 
the Kindergarten 
playground to the interior quad of our campus; 2) Expanding bus and student loading zone
s; 4) Installing cement entry ramps to classrooms in the 300 
wing; 4) Creating a student seating area located at the western corner of the cafeteria and an expanded play area west of the
 
basketball courts; and 5) 
Installing a new playground structure with 
a drinking fountain and seating area on the upper grades playground.
 
 
Members of the Wilson School Community take pride in our standing as the oldest school in the district. That pride is clearly
 
demonstrated in the 
appearance of the well
-
maintained buildi
ngs and campus landscaping. The original school structure was erected in 1920, with the present structure 
having been built in 1954. A new cafeteria was completed in 1997, and four portable classrooms were added in 2003.  The Tular
e City School District 
pr
ovides ongoing maintenance and repair for all permanent and portable buildings on our site, as well as thought the district. 
Additionally, all school 
restroom facilities for pupils and adults are maintained so that they are functional and meet local hygien
e standards generally applicable to public 
facilities. In order to sustain this level of service, the district has established a facilities inspection system to ensure 
that all school buildings meet the 
standards listed above.
 
 
The school grounds, building
s, and restrooms are kept clean, safe, and regularly maintained. Our school has a morning custodian from 6:30 A.M. to 3:30 
P.M. and an evening custodian from 12:30 P.M. to 9:00 P.M. Custodians are regularly monitored and evaluated by the building p
rincipal
 
and Director of 
Custodians to ensure that all schools are safely maintained and cleaned. In addition to the assigned school custodians, the d
istrict has a general 
maintenance crew that takes care of major repairs (plumbing, heating, cooling, gas, electric
al, carpeting, and painting). The district has a work order 
repair procedure that allows the school principal to communicate needed repairs directly to the district maintenance departme
nt. The Maintenance 
Director in turn, assigns the work to maintenance s
pecialists who complete the repairs. When deemed necessary, the district will hire an independent 
contractor to handle repairs that may be beyond the scope of the district's resources. Repairs are made on an ongoing basis.
