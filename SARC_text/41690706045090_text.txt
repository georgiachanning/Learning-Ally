School Description
 
Martin Elementary School, established in 1921, is located in
 
the city of South San Francisco. The 
campus is nestled in the San Bruno Mountains and enjoys a lush setting surrounded by trees and 
mountains. Martin School has a strong standards
-
based curriculum that reflects a genuine interest 
in meeting the needs of a
ll students. Martin School has a Response to Instruction and Intervention 
Program to address the academic, social/emotional, health, and attendance needs of our students. 
Our student population consists of 408 students. Approximately 245 of our students ar
e English 
language learners. In addition to daily English Language Development by CLAD certified teachers, 
two bilingual instructional aides assist in making the core curriculum accessible to our English 
language learners.
 
 
Computers and a library program 
are some of the amenities available to students. Individual needs 
of students are taken into account by offering programs such as the Resource Specialist Program, 
Star Vista counseling, Speech and Language Services, individual and small group reading suppo
rt 

-

fifth grade students, and an after
-
school tutoring program run by teachers at the school. There are 
two lead teachers for extra support in common core imple
mentation. There is an on
-
site pre
-
school 
and an after
-

students in grades one through five provided by the city parks and recreation department. On a 
regular basis, Martin teach
ers meet to review data and examine and analyze the effectiveness of 
their teaching practices.
 
 
The goal of Martin Elementary School is to provide every student with an equitable education. 
Students will have access to all parts of the curriculum and will 
be held to high expectations and 
standards. Students will develop tools to access information, problem solve and develop critical 
thinking skills. Each child will become a responsible, productive and environmentally aware citizen 
with the academic and soci
al skills necessary to contribute to and succeed in society.
 
 
School Mission:
 
Educating resilient lifelong learners through collaboration, communication, critical thinking, and 
creativity with awareness that each of us can grow and improve each day.

About the SARC
 
By Februar
y 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding
 
Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and
 
local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the schoo
l, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Martin Elementary School was built in 1948. The school has 25 teaching stations (5 buildings, 4 portables, MUR and Administra
tion Offices) providing 
education for grades K

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

This section provides information on the annual number of school days dedicated to staff development for the most recent thre
e
-
year period.
 
 
The focus of our professional development for the 2018
-
2019 school year was on 
Common Core Standards, Response to Instruction and Intervention, EL 
strategies, Direct Instruction, Analyzing Data, Reading Comprehension, Professional Learning Community, Integration of Techno
logy, and Math 
Strategies. The staff started the school year by
 
collecting data on both the needs of their students and on reflecting on teaching practices from the prior 
year. School needs were then determined from conversations during this data analysis component. Professional development focu
sed on Math with 
emphas
is on how to navigate through the newly adopted curriculum and EL strategies. Books were purchased about number talks to supp
ort 
implementation. Professional development also focused on the implementation of technology in the classroom with the laptop co
mp
uter carts. Direct 
Instruction professional development was provided from both the district, as well as the principal for new teachers. Strategi
es were then refined through 
in
-
class coaching, modeling and observations.
