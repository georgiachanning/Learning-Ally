By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
School Vision and Mission:
 
The mission of Cordova Meadows Elementary School is to ensure that all students learn at grade level or higher. Cordova 
Meadows Elementary School is a community of 
students, parents, volunteers and staff committed to providing excellence 
in educational programs by providing a safe, caring, and diverse learning environment where students grow academically 
and socially. Cordova Meadows Elementary School will accomplish
 
this by working as a collaborative team to provide an 
instructional program focused on standards
-
aligned instruction. Our team will use data to close learning gaps and to 
ensure the success of all students.
 
 
School & Community Profile:
 
Folsom Cordova Unif
ied School District (FCUSD) is comprised of two communities located in Sacramento County along 
Highway 50. With a population of approximately 20,500 students, schools are an average of twenty miles from downtown 
Sacramento and just over 100 miles from San 
Francisco. Folsom Cordova Unified School District enrolls Preschool thru 
Adult. There are twenty elementary schools, one charter school, four middle schools, three high schools, and five 
alternative schools. The communities of Rancho Cordova and Folsom, wh
ich comprise FCUSD, are both communities that 
have characteristics of small towns. The communities have active parent groups, service organizations, and business 
partners. Cordova Meadows Elementary School is an inviting campus with two gardens, large tree
s, a beautiful field, and 
two colorful murals. Cordova Meadows operates on a traditional schedule, and during the first month of the 2019
-
2020 
school year, 412 students were enrolled in grades preschool through fifth grade. The school's largest ethnic grou
p is 
Hispanic/Latino, with 39.6% of the school population describing themselves as Latino/Hispanic. In terms of racial 
subgroups, significant numbers include African
-
American at 14%, White at 17%, Asian 15.9%, Two or More Races,10.2% 
and 3% of Native Ameri
can, Filipino, and Pacific Islander. This includes a recent enrollment of approximately 100 student 
refugees from Afghanistan.  Cordova Meadows Elementary School has 60 students enrolled in the After School Education 

aily until 6:00pm.
 
 
Our staff is trained in effective intervention practices with children, and our teachers are regularly provided professional 
development to increase and improve their instructional effectiveness. For our Professional Learning Communitie
s (PLCs), 
we have contracted with The Core Collaborative to create Impact Teams which meet weekly. Funding from our School 
Improvement Grant (SIG), Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF), and the general fund assist to improve collective teacher 
efficacy and
 
provide high levels of learning for all students. Our new master schedule provides for daily Response to 
Intervention (RtI) and/or remediation in small(er) group settings.  We are a uniform school to minimize the clothing cost 
to parents, to help focus ou
r students before their arrival at school, and to protect our students physically and socially. 
Cordova Meadows students in 4th and 5th grade receive instrumental music instruction.

Cordova Meadows Elementary parents consistently and repeatedly express th
e desire to be involved in their child's 
education. The strong parent and community support we receive supports the goal of providing an excellent educational 
program in a warm, caring, and safe environment. The school will be expending considerable time a
nd resources 
establishing strong connections to the parent and family community through School Site Council (SSC), English Language 
Advisory Committee (ELAC), English classes, parent leadership activities, family nights, and informational events for 
parent
s in response to conversations administration has been having with parents.  Parents are recruited to be involved 
in every aspect of the services to our students. We want parents in the classroom, in the Parent Teacher Association (PTA), 
in our Community G
ardens, in our Adult English as a Second Language (ESL) classes, as well as other programs. Unique 
characteristics about our school make us desirable for many parents to select us through the district School Choice 
Program.  Our community stakeholders like
 
Rotary, Soil Born Farms, and Cordova Church of Christ support our students 
with donations and the gift of time.
 
 
Creating a positive culture and climate is a focus at Cordova Meadows.  In order to keep the momentum of decreasing 
suspension rates, 
Cordova Meadows has expanded our Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) focus to 
include a focus on culture and climate.  We will continue to build positive school and classroom climates by extending 
existing Tier 1 PBIS initiatives.  We rec
ently received recognition from the California PBIS Coalition for successful PBIS 
implementation at the SILVER level.  Buddy classrooms have been created to allow students to continue to be at school 
and learning if/when school rules are broken.  Social
-
em
otional development and well
-
being for educators and students 
continues to be a priority as we move into developing Tier 2 PBIS structure.  Restorative Justice practices and how they 
can be best implemented at Cordova Meadows is also a focus of the PBIS te
am.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Cordova Meadows Elementary (CME) greatly benefits from its supportive parents.  Cordova Meadows Elementary parents 
consistently and repeatedly express the desire to be involved in their child's education. The strong parent and community 
support we receive 
supports the goal of providing an excellent educational program in a warm, caring, and safe 
environment. The school expends considerable time and resources establishing strong connections to the parent and 
family community through School Site Council (SSC)
, English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), English classes, parent 
leadership activities, family nights, and informational events for parents in response to conversations administration has 
been having with parents.  Parents are recruited to be involved
 
in every aspect of the services to our students. We want 
parents in the classroom, in the Parent Teacher Association (PTA), in our Community Gardens, in our Adult English as a 
Second Language (ESL) classes, as well as other programs.  Unique characteristi
cs about our school make us desirable for 
many parents to select us through the district School Choice Program.  Cordova Meadows is committed to partner with 
parents and community members to assist with the development of financial resources and volunteer 
time to help the 
Cordova Meadows' students have access to extended learning opportunities.  We encourage stakeholders to volunteer in 
classrooms as well as participate in school activities and workshops to support struggling students.  Parents at Cordova 
M
eadows are valued and prioritized. Parents are welcomed, our PTA is growing in numbers, and Site Council Members 
and bilingual parents assist us in monitoring school progress through surveys, meetings, and data walks.  Parents or 
community members who wish
 
to participate in leadership teams, school committees, school activities, or become a 
volunteer, may contact  Silia Blount, our CME Parent Coordinator,  916

Cordova Meadows is a safe and clean school. A partnership between a variety of stakeholders including the district, staff, 
students, parents, and the community support our comprehensive safety plan. The school rules are published in the School 
Handbook and
 
shared with families at the start of the new school year.  We continually promote a positive school culture 
through our PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports) team, which is composed of staff, parents, ans students.  
Restrooms and eating facil
ities are cleaned daily. Classrooms and all school buildings are cleaned on a regular schedule.  
Any safety hazard that is reported is reviewed immediately and resolved. Safety plans are reviewed each fall and spring. 
There were five student accidents repo
rted at our school in the 2018
-
2019 school year.
 
 
School safety plans are reviewed twice yearly, updated monthly, and school
-
wide emergency plans are in place in case a 
threatening situation should arise. These plans include safety accomodatio for physical
ly challenged students. Monthly 
disaster and/or fire drills provide practice for all staff and students in emergency readiness.
