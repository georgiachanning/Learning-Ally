School Description
 
Red Bluff K
-
5 Community Day School is an Alternative Education program within the Red Bluff Union 
Elementary School District, serving 

-

placed at the school through an expulsion, administration placement, probation or a School 
Attendance Review Board (SARB) hearing.
 
 
Students at Red Bluff K
-
5 Community Day School are guided by spec
ific rules and expectations that 
promote positive behaviors and social skills, and self
-
esteem. The discipline program provides 
students with opportunities to learn self
-
discipline through a system of consistent rewards and 
consequences for their behavior.
 
Students are taught that, with positive behaviors, they can gain 
independence, and that freedom is earned, not given. Parents and students are informed of 
discipline policies during the placement meeting, and the Parent/Student Handbook, where results 
of 
positive and negative social behaviors are outlined for students and the responsibilities and 
privileges that are associated with those positive behaviors are illustrated. The Mission of the Red 
Bluff Union Elementary School District K
-
5 Community Day Scho
ols is to provide a safe, caring, 
supportive environment where academic success is achieved through respect and cooperation 
among staff, students and parents/guardians, empowering students to become productive 
members of the community.
 
 
It is the belief th
at all students can learn and behave appropriately. In order to act from that belief, 
we will provide Red Bluff K
-
5 Community Day School students a disciplined environment both 
academically and socially. The outcomes of this support, structure, and discipl
ine for our students 
include academic success, participation in creative and engaging curriculum, and the acquisition of 
positive social skills. As a result of these outcomes our students will gain a more positive view of 
school and, most importantly, them
selves. When students transition to their next school they will 
be equipped with the skills necessary for success. They will be confident in their abilities to meet 
the academic and social challenges that lie ahead.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
RBUESD funded 
services for CDS include: Counseling/Psych services, Nurse services, Special 
Education services as determined by IEP and Parent education opportunities.

DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/

system that provides reports for accou
ntability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible 
(e.g., 
the California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally 
provided on a first
-
come, first

served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of 
operation, the length of time that a workstation may b
e used (depending on availability), the types

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The 
SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), whi
ch describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more informat
ion about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at
