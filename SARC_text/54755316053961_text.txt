A Message from the Principal:
 
Grand View Elementary School is rich in culture and tradition. Our little country 
school has educated 
generations of Dinubans. We are very proud of our past and very excited about our future! We
 
have 
celebrated over
 
100 year of educating Dinuba students.
 
Our academic success continues to be a 
focus, and we are working continously to "En
d Generational Poverty Through Education".
 
 
 
We are currently using the adopted
 
Journeys reading and language arts program in grades kinder 
through 5th.
 
 
Our 6th grade is using the newly adopted
 
Collections curriculum in English Language 
Arts. In the are
a of Mathematics, Go Math! 
 
has been adopted in
 
 
kindergarten through sixth 
grades. Our students are challenged daily with rigorous curriculum and meaningful activities 
designed to teach the California Common Core standards at each grade level. Instruction
al 
strategies as well as the most current lesson designs are being practiced
 
 
to ensure that students 
achieve with a high level of understanding.
 
Several of our
 
teachers have
 
many 
 
years of experience 
teaching, and they continue to improve their skills to 
best meet the needs of every child.
 
 
Parents are always welcome at Grand View. We have several classroom volunteers, our annual 
Country Fair, and various community service projects throughout the school year. Our Booster Club 
supports student activities.
 
If you are interested in helping, please contact the school office.
 
 
Our interventions include re
-
teach, remediation, enrichment, English Language Development, and 
GATE programs are all in place to meet the diverse needs of our students.
 
 
The 
number of students at Grand View who are English Learners continues to be about 48%.
 
 
Their 
progress toward English proficiency is continuing to grow. Intensive staff training on research
-
based teaching practices in English Language Development has paid of
f. Our English learners 
continue to perform well in academics and on standardized tests.
 
 
We are committed to attaining excellence by building a foundation of respect, cooperation, and 
trust among students, staff, parents and community. Grade level stand
ards are taught in every 
classroom every day with the goal of high achievement for all students.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abo
ut the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school 
principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Grand View provides a safe, clean environment for learning. Our facilities are in good condition overall. We make regular rep
airs; prioritize funding for 
deferred maintenance, and handle major expenses
 
yearly as funds are available.
 
 
In September of 2014 we received 2 additional modular 
classrooms.
 
 
These two modular classrooms along with our 13 portable classrooms and four permanent classrooms brings Grand Views total
 
 
to 19 
classrooms. The older class
room wing and cafeteria are more than 50 years old with the portables being
 
9 years old. All rooms have security telephone 
and intercom systems. In 2014 we also replaced our primary grade outside play station with a modern unit including 2 slides a
nd a spi
ral climbing area. 
Additional parking was also created in 2014 by extending the northern parking lot.
 
 
In 2016 a new entrance into the office was created along with security 
gates to further our efforts toward student safety.
 
 
In the summer of 2017 the int
ermediate grade restrooms were refurbished including hand dryers.
 
In 
the summer of 2018 new carpet was installed in four classroom completing our project to replace carpet in all classrooms.
 
 
also in the summer of 2018 
all parking lots and blacktop areas w
ere resurfaced for durability and safety.
 
 
Our well
-
maintained grounds provide a beautiful setting. The district 
insurance agent inspects our campus annually to insure a safe environment.
 
 
In the summer of 2019 the north and west parking lots were restripe

ity: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

n
d listening to your child 
everyday will help to increase their knowledge base.

School Safety Plan
 
Student safety is of the utmost importance at Grand View. We understand that parents expect their children to be safe in our 
care, and we take that 
responsibility seriously. Staff members monito
r our playground and campus before school, after school, and during recess. Our discipline policies curtail 
fighting and bullying. Grand View has followed the district expectation of implementation of PBIS
-
 
Positive Behavior Intervention Support, and has e
arned 
the highest state recognition, Platinum Status, from the state of California .
 
 
By following the tiered intervention plan of PBIS we have been able to 
address student expectations for behavior on a similar method as we address our other curricular ar
eas that are taught.
 
 
Grand View playground 
equipment is up to current safety standards and we inspect it regularly. In 2015
-
16 a safety fence was added to the
 
north side
 
of the school which has 
allowed for the campus to be completely fenced in. In the sum
mer of 2018
 
new carpet was installed in four classrooms completing our project of 
installing
 
updated carpet in all classrooms.
 
 
In 2016 a new entrance into the office was created along with security gates to further our efforts toward 
student safety.
 
 
 
 
Al
so in the summer of 2018, all parking and blacktop areas were resealed.
 
 
We routinely go over playground safety rules with students 
and we hold fire drills monthly.
 
 
We also conduct Lockdown drills and earthquake drills quarterly. Our safety plan is under 
constant revision, so we will 
be prepared if an emergency should occur. The School Safety Plan is reviewed and approved by the School Site Council annually
.

of teaching and learning. Our Leadership Team is composed of six teachers, the a
cademic coach, and the site principal. They convene monthly to strive 
for continuous improvement for all staff and to share best practices among the grade levels. Grand View also has a Building C
oherence for Instructional 
Improvement (BCII) model that we h
ave been focusing on.
 
 
The BCII work addresses writing in all grade levels and how each grade levels work in writing 
builds to the following grade.
 
 
This team of teachers and the
 
site administrator work to improve school wide initiatives that will further 
the academic 
development of our students.
 
 
 
Our teachers meet with the district math coach following math benchmarks to analyze data and plan next steps for instruction.
 
Trainings in math 
concepts, technology, language arts curriculum, and language devel
opment are offered throughout the year for all teachers to attend.
