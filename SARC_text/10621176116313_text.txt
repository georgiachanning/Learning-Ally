About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Clovis Elementary is going into its 19th year. We opened at the campus in the 2000
-
01 school year. Located on 18.6 acres just east of Clovis High School, 
our modern campus currently enr
olls approximately 700 stu
-
 
dents but can house additional students if necessary. The campus features the following 
structures:
 

 
A large multipurpose room
 

 
A beautiful library media center
 

 
Four transitional
-
kindergarten classrooms
 

 
20 regular education classr
ooms for grades 1
-
6
 

 
Three music classrooms
 

 
One resource
-
specialist classroom
 

 
Two intervention classrooms
 

 
Two portable classrooms housing preschool and Campus Club
 

 
Two portable classrooms housing medically fragile students
 

 
One speech classroom shared 
with the school psychologist
 
 
The campus grounds are kept clean through the efforts of our students and custodial staff. Our custodians perform basic clean
ing operations daily and 
maintain the grounds and buildings. In addition, deep cleaning is conducted 
two times a year. The plant supervisor is on campus from early morning to 

he clean
-
campus inspections 
for the past several years. T
his high rating is due to the efforts of our custodial staff, general staff, students and the community. Moreover, 96 percent
 

 
 
Districtwide, 90 percent of paren

-
fiti is removed immediately. Through increased community awareness, 
school pride and an open
-
campus policy, we hope to keep vandalism and burglary at an all
-
time low. 
 
 
This summer, all the buildings and do
ors were painted. The blacktop was taken out and new pavement was laid. New lines were painted on the blacktop 
and two volleyball courts were added. The kinder
-
garten play area was also repainted, and additional hop scotch games were added. Window murals 
a
nd art were added on some of the buildings to get students and families excited about the start of the school year. 
 
 
A safety measure put in place for our stu
-
dents and staff are large signs in the three main locations leading into the campus. These signs
 
direct all visitors 
to the main office. Once in the office, visitors sign in and receive a badge. The badge needs to be worn in a visible area so
 
that staff members can see it 
without hesitation. This protocol is in place for the safety of all our student
s and staff. 
 
 
Additionally, all staff members have handheld radios to utilize on campus in the case of an emergency. If a student is injure
d out on the playground, the 
nurse can be called on the radio and report out to the field for support. The radios al
so provide an opportunity for teach
-
ers to report anything that is 
out of the ordinary on campus or the perimeter of the campus. 
 
 
To provide a safe environment for our stu
-
dents, adult supervision is available from 8 a.m. to 3:15 p.m., except on early rel
ease days on Wednesdays, 
where supervision ends at 1:45 p.m. 
 
 
Students not participating in the ASES or Campus Club programs must exit campus at the end of the day. The district provides 
before
-
 
and after
-
school 
service for inter
-
ested
 
parents. Contact the Campus Club at (559) 327
-
9160. 
 
 
Philosophically, the district believes schools are the hub of their neighbor
-
 
hoods. As a result, we place a high priority on building and maintaining excellent 
facilities as economically as possible.

Clovis Ele
mentary enjoys the benefits of a very supportive community. We are proud of the partnership we have formed with our parents a
nd will 
continue to serve the needs of our community by providing every child with a comprehensive and challenging educational prog
ram.
 
 
The Clovis Elementary Parent Club is very active on our campus. Its fundraising efforts have supported our students and staff
 
with additional lunchtime

School Safety Plan was reviewed and updated in January 2020. The School Safety Plan is available for parent review in the sch
ool office.
 
 
Staff and students review fire, lockdown and earthquake drills at the beginning of the year and then practic
e several times during the year. This year all 
staff members were trained in Active Shooter training
 
 
in August. Staff members reviewed what steps to take if they encounter an active shooter on any campus in CUSD.

Additionally, campus safety is promoted by the use of four adult campus monitors during the lunch periods, a Student
 
Safety Patrol, and staff supervision 
at strategic points on campus before and after school and during recess periods. Currently a Clovis Elementary parent is work

The school has signs posted on the buildings outlining student expectations. The signs are visual reminders to students to ma
ke good choices. They also 
inform parents and community about the high expectations we have for our 
students. The staff continues to receive training working with students from 
diverse backgrounds and how to work with students who are problematic in the classroom. This year all teachers will be implem
enting the Second Step 
Curriculum in their classrooms.
 
This curriculum gives students ways to work through problems and how to respond to adults and peers. We are very 
excited about the positive outcome this curricilum will have for our staff and students. For the third year, teachers will be

Professional development is ongoing to keep the Clovis Elementary teachers abreast of new learning strat
-
egies, innovative teaching techniques and 
applied technology in the field of education. Weekly planning opportunities are provided for teachers on Wedn
esday early release days to coordinate 
and plan lessons or units as an entire grade level. In addition, site funding is provided for teachers to take additional pla
nning days to spend time looking 
over new ELA curriculum and other resources to better meet 
the needs of our students. Teachers will continue to receive training in the areas of math, 
Close Reading, diversity training and working with problematic students. The Second Step Curriculum was purchased through a g
rant that was written in 
June. A presen
tation on the curriculum was held in October for parents. The staff is very excited about the implementation of this curricul
um.
 
 
Teachers also share research
-
based teaching strategies that will assist all students in making academic growth during Professi
onal Learning Community 
(PLC) meetings. These weekly planning meetings assist with closely monitoring student growth. Instructional adjustments can b
e made to ensure teachers 
are provid
-
ing a challenging curriculum for those students excelling and provide 
support to those students struggling academically. Additionally, 
assessment data is reviewed, and Action Plans are developed to assist students. These Action Plans are then implemented and r
evisited every quarter. 
For the 2018
-
19 school year, teachers will
 
focus on one Essential Standard in math and ELA. Teachers will write assessments and have PLC meet
-
ings to 
look over data and adjust their instruction where necessary. Mastery of the Essential Standard in ELA and math will assist al
l our students on the S
BAC 
and district assessments. Building strategies and stamina at every grade level in the areas of math word problems and reading
 
with justification will also 
support our students on the end of year assessments.
 
 
Teachers acquire new knowledge through dist
rict workshops, curriculum rollouts, on
-
site training provided by administration, district personnel and 
conferences. Teachers are supported through principal observations and feedback. Clovis Elementary students continue to show 
academic progress due 
to o
ur staff training. For
-
mal Progress Monitoring meetings are held twice a year with teachers and administration to review student assessment data. 
Informal meetings are held throughout the year. These meetings help to keep us focused on the academic progres
s of all students and target areas of 
concern.
 
 
Parents are welcome to observe classroom instruction anytime, as long as they make arrangements with teachers prior to their 
visit and have been 

 
 
Th
e district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, master
y learning, multi
-
tiered system 
of supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural re
levant understanding. In the 2018
-
19 school year, 
the district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional develop
ment opportunities on staff 
development days, substitute release days, and on ear
ly release days. A variety of after
-
school workshops were also offered throughout the school 
year.One hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty
-
five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching 
through the CUSD I
nduction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site
-
based training and district sponsored training that included:  
curriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi
-
tiered systems of support, and cultur

Types of Services Funded
 

 
On an annual basis, Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) submits the Application for Funding Consolidated Application and Re
porting System for 
Categorical Aid Programs commonly called CARS. The application is submitted in two (2) parts:  Part I, which con
tains program and demographic 
information, is submitted by June 1 each year; and Part II, which contains the budget information and additional program data
, is submitted by January 
31 each year.  The categorical programs included in the application are Tit
le I, Part A 

 
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged 
Improving, Title I, Part C 

 
Migrant Education, Title II, Part A 

 
Preparing, Training and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals, and Title III 

 
Language Instruction for Limi
ted English Proficient and Immigrant Students.  Essentially, these funds are designed to assist students in mastering state 
standards.
 
 
Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community
.  CUSD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive differences in the lives of the children we all support.  We know from research tha

education will not only bring success to your child but other children 
in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending
 
on the type of categorical 
funding a site may re
ceive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and guidelines.  Such adviso

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each and every s
tudent.  Parental involvement is a necessary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall program.  At the district level, parent committees provide input into each of the 

Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP)

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://
www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
t
s, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.

District Advisory Committ
ee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves as an advisory committee
 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. 
They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs are supplemental education opportunit
ies that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  Th
e SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are 
required to form an ELAC. The ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding ser
vices for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two 
years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall 
be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a D
ELAC representative and arrange to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/gu
ardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) 
currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) elected to serve as the DELAC 

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meet
s four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achievement of our students, comm
unity agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan
 
Native students in grades K

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP a
nnually that works to better align the academic plan with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to 
participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participa
tion of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, District Meetings and 
Community Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share 
their ideas on how CUSD 
ca
n provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in the forums wi


 
 
These forums are designed to provide an opportunit

provide input and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to sha
re new ideas to support 
identifi
ed groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical funding and programs in CUSD.  These funds are further discussed and outlined
 

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 
Gen

ics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economic
ally disadvantaged homes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they have a primary language other than English.  Ch
ildren, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally
 
provided through the base/core curriculum program.  The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Catego
rical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support t
o meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of high quality
 
learning opportunities and access to the core curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additional assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom pro
gram (base/core curriculum) 
and address any learning ga
ps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff development.   Staff developme
nt 
activities are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other staff to 
cha
llenge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
 
 
Categorical Program Descriptions
 
After School Safety and Education Funds (ASES):  This state funded and administered program provides three
-
year grant funding to establish or expand 
after sc
hool programs that provide students with academic support and intervention, enrichment opportunities and supportive services 
to help the 
students meet state and local standards in core content areas. The purpose of the ASES program is to create additional 
educational and recreational 
opportunities for students within the learning community while providing a safe environment for students. The goals of this p
rogram are to: 1) improve 
academic achievement, and 2) provide enrichment opportunities that reinforce
 
and complement the academic program.
 
 
1.
 
Title I, Part A (Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged):  A federal
-
funded program to provide high
-
quality opportunities 
for students in high

poverty schools to meet district and state content and pe
rformance standards.
 
2.
 
Title I, Part A, Title X, Part C, Education for Homeless Children and Youths:  Title I, Part A funds provide comparable servi
ces to homeless children 
that assist them to effectively take advantage of educational opportunities as provid
ed to children in schools funded under Title I, Part A. These 
comparable services shall be provided to homeless children in public and private schools, shelters and other locations where 
children may live, 
institutions for neglected children and, where app
ropriate, local institutions such as local community day school programs.
