By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Rustic Lane Elementary School, the home of the Leopards, guides students to explore the attributes of Respect, 
Ownership, Attitude, and Responsibility as they embark on their learning adventures. Ou
r school is committed to providing 
learning opportunities that are engaging and will assist our students not only with academic success, but also in making 
responsible decisions when solving problems that may confront them in the challenging world they liv
e in. We hold high 
standards of excellence for ourselves and our students and work hard to give every student what he/she needs to succeed. 
At Rustic Lane, we strive for students to experience a well
-
rounded program that helps them harness their uniqueness
 
and strengths. Our teachers work diligently to create a learning environment that is responsive to the differences in our 
students' academic levels, interests, and learning styles. We provide a safe, positive, and supportive school experience so 
that all 
students feel valued and encouraged to achieve their personal best.
 
 
Teachers meet regularly to discuss effective teaching strategies, and analyze data from Common Core aligned assessments 
to inform their planning. Within that collaboration time, teachers 
organize curriculum and learning experiences to guide 
students in developing a deep understanding of the Common Core Standards. The goal is for students to be engaged in 
learning experiences that prepare them for their futures; developing skills along the 
way that guide them to be college 
and career ready. Opportunities for problem solving, critical thinking, analysis, collaboration/feedback, and technology 
are regular components of the high
-
level expectations that teachers build into the daily instructiona
l practices.
 
 
Besides the regular instructional program, various other programs exist to challenge and support our students.
 
Rustic Lane 
has a variety of extended learning opportunities (Saturday School/Family Nights, etc.), Think Together, 100 Mile Club, 
GATE, Primary Intervention/Early Literacy programs, and Guided Reading, to name a few.
 
 
It takes true partnership to make Ru
stic Lane a success, and with everyone working together, our students can and will 
achieve their dreams. Rustic Lane students will become collaborative, reflective, and thoughtful citizens contributing great 
things to society. Our world needs individuals t
hat can think critically, communicate clearly, and participate responsibly. 
Within our community, we can guide and support students to achieve and dream big!
 
 
Mission/Vision Statement
 
 
We are committed to establishing a school culture which 
recognizes no limitations in the achievement and success of each 
student.
 
 
Students will develop skills to ensure College & Career Readiness; engage academically and socially in a safe, orderly, and 
inviting environment; and our families will be encouraged
 
to be active participants in their students' education.

Year and month in 
which data were collected:
 
September 27, 2019
 
 
Jurupa Unified School District conducts an evaluation of instructional materials to adopt materials that best meet the 
needs of students. The district conducts adoptions on a districtwide basis. The review pro
cess includes a committee of a 
majority of classroom teachers in the appropriate discipline (Education Code Section 60210). In addition, all instructional 
materials are in compliance with social content standards. When making adoption decisions, the adopti
on committee uses 
the content standards, the curriculum frameworks, the State Board of Education
-
adopted evaluation criteria, and the 
reports on each adoption as resources. The final decision for selecting and recommending textbook adoptions is with the 
ad
option committee. The most recently adopted textbooks were selected from the state
-
approved list.
 
 
All students, including English learners, have standards
-
aligned textbooks checked out to them, to use in class and to take 
home, in each of the core curricu
lum areas of reading/language arts, mathematics, science and history/social science; 
foreign language and health; visual and performing arts; and science laboratory equipment for grades nine through twelve 
as appropriate.
 
 
Elementary students receive core 
curriculum textbooks on the first day of enrollment.  Middle school and high school 
students receive textbooks checked out to them at registration days a few days before the first day of school.  All students 
enrolling after the first day of school have co
re curriculum textbooks checked out to them by the Library Clerk on their 
first day of enrollment.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The safety, cleanliness, and adequacy of our school facilities are a high priority for the District. Overall, school grounds 
and 
facilities are in good repair. The Districts Deferred Maintenance Plan is assessed and updated every year. Work generated 
by th
e Deferred Maintenance Plan is generally completed during the summer months. Fire inspections are conducted on 
an annual basis and any issues are addressed immediately. The District also has an internal inspection team conducting 
annual safety inspections 
of all sites. All safety
-
related items are handled as a top priority.
 
 
Rustic Lane has approximately 32 classrooms, a library/innovation center that includes a makerspace, a band/orchestra 
room, and various mini offices to support storage needs and the var
ious non
-
teaching support staff on campus. We have 
two full
-
time custodians (day and night) who are supportive of maintaining cleanliness and safety of our facilities and 
reporting necessary repairs. All staff work to ensure the campus is in good repair, r
eporting concerns/needs as they arise 
to custodial staff/administration. Students are also encouraged to take pride and ownership in the campus through ROAR 
expectations, lucky leopards, and various announcements/reminders.
 
 
Over the last several years, a 
variety of facility improvements to the campus have been made.  Gates were installed to 
increase safety and restrict open access for the public, roofs and pathways have been refurbished as needed,  lighting 
needs are maintained/added for safety, improvemen
ts to drains are ongoing, etc. Most recently, some fencing and a 
crosswalk were added to the front parking lot in order to better structure the flow of traffic and improve the overall safety
 
of students and families arriving to and leaving the site. A new 
playground structure was added as well as a track for 
students. Our MPR also received a hydration station, and carpet/tile was replaced across the entire campus. The library 
space was also rennovated to integrate a makerspace with the literature and techno
logy materials already available. 
Blacktop areas of the campus including the playground were repaved for safety. Roof repairs were done, and painting of 
the campus is in progress.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of 
students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Great success at any school does not happen without a team effort. At Rustic Lane, parents are invited to become active 
participants in our school community through volunteering, joining our PTO/Booster Club, as well as attending and 
supporting school even
ts. Throughout the year, announcements of upcoming meetings, parent
-
teacher conferences, 
assemblies, performances, workshops, etc. are provided to families to ensure the development of that important 
partnership. As a community, we share the responsibility
 

support the educational program of Rustic Lane by ensuring that students:
 
 

 
2) Complete all homework assignments 
given by teachers
 
3) Read daily to develop a love for reading and to improve literacy skills
 
4) Practice basic math facts and look for examples of how math is a part of the world
 
5) Share school experiences with the family so that you are aware of 
his/her school life
 
6) Inform parent/guardian if he/she needs additional support in any area or subject
 
7) Know that you expect him/her to succeed in school and to give his/her very best
 
 
Parents have the opportunity to participate in various school organi
zations within Rustic Lane, such as School Site Council, 
English Learner Advisory Committee, Parent/Teacher Organization, and GATE Advisory Committee. Through their 
participation, parents are able to provide feedback in decision making for the school. Rust
ic Lane is in the process of 
growing our Parent/Teacher Organization. As demands on the classroom teachers increase, the parent participation in 
this organization becomes ever more important to the school. The PTO is responsible for many fundraising progra
ms that 
support the site being able to send all 6th graders to science camp annually. In addition, the PTO raises funds for grade 
level needs and provides opportunities for families to come together at the site: Movie Nights, Dances, Muffins with Moms 
and 
Donuts with Dads, Jog
-
a
-
thons, etc. Additional events include Walk to School Wednesdays, and various Family 
Nights/extended Saturday School opportunities to support efforts in building Digital Citizenship, technology, and AVID 
efforts. Rustic Lane is alway
s looking for ways to grow and invite our families into the campus. Parents are also able to 
communicate with staff members using the Class Dojo system along with various social media platforms to stay informed.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Rustic Lane Elementary School in accordance with Senate Bill 187 has safe school strategies that include information on 
the status of school crime and the following elements: safe school programs; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster 
response procedu
res; suspension and expulsion policies pursuant to Education Code 48900, 48915, and 49079; the 
District's Discipline Handbook, and Sexual Harassment Policy; our school dress code; and procedures and rules for safety 
on the way to and from school as well as
 
during school hours.
 
 
The site Safety Plan is updated every year by the School Safety Coordinator, the leadership team, and administration. It is 
then presented to and approved by our School Site Council. Rustic Lane practices monthly safety drills includ
ing 
fire/earthquake/lockdown; and a comprehensive disaster drill is held once a year districtwide. After each of these drills, 
staff feedback is solicited and the suggestions are taken back to the safety coordinator for consideration when revising 
the scho
ol safety plan and procedures. Teachers and students at Rustic Lane are well prepared with information and 
routines to support them should an actual emergency take place. Each teacher is provided a copy of the plan annually, 
and it is reviewed so all staff
 
clearly understand their various roles during emergencies. In addition, an annual inventory 
of supplies is also conducted to replace/replenish essential materials to ensure safety. The Safety Coordinator and 
Administrative designee also attend workshops a
s available to keep our site up to date with current information and 
support.
 
 
In addition to this plan, Rustic Lane has established a Social Emotional Learning (SEL) program on campus. Among its many 
functions, this program works to promote a positive, sa
fe, and productive school environment that ensures quality 
learning and enrichment for all students.
 
 
The school safety plan was most recently reviewed and updated in March 2019.
