Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
2019 August
 
 
Folsom Cordova Unified held a Public Hearing on December 19, 2019, and determined that each school wit
hin the District 
has sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual stand
ards
-
aligned 
textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the State Department of Education, making the 
textbo
oks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended mater
ials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. 
The table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
T
he percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Riverview Science Technology Engineering and Math STEM Academy encourages and values parent involvement. We 
provide many opportunities for parents to become involved with their child's educational ex
perience. Opportunities for 
parental involvement include:
 
 
1.
 
Parent Volunteers:  Parents are welcomed and encouraged to work in classrooms, attend field trips, and serve on 
important school committees. Such committees include; School Site Council (SSC), Vari
ous  Parent Teacher 
Association (PTA) committees, Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) Advisory, and the English Language Advisory 
Committee (ELAC).
 
 
2.
 
Parent Teacher Association (PTA): Our energetic and hard working PTA actively organizes numerous activitie
s and 
events which enhance the positive bond between parents, teachers, and students. PTA fundraisers provide 
financial support for field trips, after
-
school enrichment activities, and various other activities and programs.
 
 
3.
 
Various School Events:  The PTA
 
and the school site hold many enriching events over the course of the school year. 
Included in these events are a STEM Faire, Harvest Festival, book fairs, family nights, a jogathon, Mental Math 
Bowl, Family Coding Night, STEM Olympics, and much more.
 
 
4.
 
Pa
stries with the Principal:  This is a monthly, informal meeting with the principal and all interested families.  We 
invite parents to attend through our school Newsletter, schoolwide signage, and blackboard.  It is a time to review 
school initiatives, get 
parent feedback and suggestions, problem solve, network, and work on building a 
parent/school partnership.
 
 
Parents are a vital part of what we do as a Riverview. For additional information about organized opportunities for parent

Safety and Emergency Response Plan
 
Riverview Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) Academy has a Comprehensive School Safety Plan that 
includes a systematic structure of steps to follow in an emergency. Plan components
 
include active shooter, bomb threats, 
earthquake, lost child, site maintenance, and other situations that may create imminent danger.  The plan also includes 
child abuse reporting, suspension/expulsion policies, and a school rules and discipline plan. The
re is monthly practice of 
emergency procedures with students and staff.  Fire drills, lock
-
down, civil defense, and earthquake drills are reviewed 
and practiced every month.  District and school site staff are provided training and practice through an emer
gency 
preparedness program called Hour Zero.  Our Emergency Response Plan is coordinated and supported by local law 
enforcement.   This Emergency Response Plan meets California State requirements and has been approved by the Folsom 
Cordova Unified School D
istrict (FCUSD) School Board and our School Site Council (SSC).  Last year, during the 2018
-
19 
school year, we had 8 student accidents.  We would like to reduce this number of accidents.
