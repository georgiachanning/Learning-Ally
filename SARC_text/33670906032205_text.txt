By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Pedley Elementary School is one of seventeen elementary schools 
in the Jurupa Unified School District. The District is a 
unified TK
-
12 district encompassing 44 square miles. Pedley is located in the city of Jurupa Valley, California and within 
the Riverside Country.  Currently, Pedley's enrollment is 653 students, tran
sitional kindergarten through sixth grade. The 
school was constructed in 1953.
 
 
We are one of the Dual Immersion school sites in the district.  The entire staff is dedicated to providing an environment 
that promotes and reinforces a safe campus so that eac
h student can All of the Local Control Accountability Plan
-
LCAP 
Priorities are addressed in the School Plan under three focus areas. Learning Outcomes, Student Achievement and 
Engagement. Each category in the LCAP Local Control Accountability Plan addresse
s either college & career readiness, 
data driven decision making safe, orderly environment or parent, student & community engagement.  Dual Immersion is 
a unique educational program designed to develop bilingualism and bi literacy in English and in Spanish
. This is a voluntary 
program. Instruction is provided by highly trained and specialized teachers. Students learn California standards in all 
subject areas, and become linguistically and academically fluent in two languages. It will follow the 90/10 model 
of Two 
Way Immersion TWI. The first number refers to the amount of instructional time initially spent for instruction in the target 
or non
-
English language in kindergarten. The second number refers to English. In a 90:10 model the amount of the target 
lang
uage decreases yearly as English increases until there is a 50:50 balance of the languages generally in grades four 
through six. English time must be carefully defined and implemented. High quality curriculum and instruction are essential. 
Research shows t
hat when programs are fully implemented according to the program design, English learners in 90:10 
models score as well as or better than their peers in other programs in English tests. (Lindholm

Language Education, Multilingual Matters 
LTD) We are part AVID Elementary in an effort to prepare students for College 
and Career. This organization works on Professional Development to help schools improve on college and career readiness 
strategies in the classroom. The school year is 180 tradit
ional days and has been restricted to include 37 minimum days in 
order to support teacher collaboration.
 
 
Our mission at Pedley School is to provide students, staff, and their families with a safe, supportive, and engaging school 
environment in which all s
tudents reach academic and technological proficiency.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 27, 2019
 
 
Jurupa Unified School District conducts an evaluation of 
instructional materials to adopt materials that best meet the 
needs of students. The district conducts adoptions on a districtwide basis. The review process includes a committee of a 
majority of classroom teachers in the appropriate discipline (Education C
ode Section 60210). In addition, all instructional 
materials are in compliance with social content standards. When making adoption decisions, the adoption committee uses 
the content standards, the curriculum frameworks, the State Board of Education
-
adopted
 
evaluation criteria, and the 
reports on each adoption as resources. The final decision for selecting and recommending textbook adoptions is with the 
adoption committee. The most recently adopted textbooks were selected from the state
-
approved list.
 
 
All s
tudents, including English learners, have standards
-
aligned textbooks checked out to them, to use in class and to take 
home, in each of the core curriculum areas of reading/language arts, mathematics, science and history/social science; 
foreign language an
d health; visual and performing arts; and science laboratory equipment for grades nine through twelve 
as appropriate.
 
 
Elementary students receive core curriculum textbooks on the first day of enrollment.  Middle school and high school 
students receive tex
tbooks checked out to them at registration days a few days before the first day of school.  All students 
enrolling after the first day of school have core curriculum textbooks checked out to them by the Library Clerk on their 
first day of enrollment.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Pedley Elementary School students, staff and parents believe in the importance of building a school community to 
promote a life
-
long love of learning for all stakeholders.  Our school campus is a closed campus and visitors can come to 
the front office for 
clearance and sign in while visiting our campus.  All stakeholders are encouraged to participate in, 
evaluate, and refine the learning partnership so every child experiences success and no child is left behind.  The School is 
about fifty years old, but the
 
buildings are maintained well. There are forty classrooms, MPR, and an administration 
building. Half of the classrooms are portables. The school is cleaned and landscaping is maintained by the district.  
Custodians and the principal work collaboratively t
o ensure that all work orders are completed and maintain an updated 
weekly collaboration meeting.  Safety is our top priority and we monitor that all classrooms are secure at all times.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Staff development is provided through meaningful activities that assist teachers in staying abreast of new techniques and 
methodologies in educational topics have focused on 
improving and meeting the current standards, increasing the rigor 
in the core curriculum, and effective teaching strategies for English Learners.  Our teachers have been trained by Riverside 
County Office of Education on ELA/ELD and Math Common Core Standa
rds.  We have also had training on Balanced Math, 
DIBELS, IDEL, ELPAC, McGraw Hill, Next Generation Science Standards, AVID Elementary, Inclusion, Impact Teams, Project 
GLAD, Inclusion, Guided Reading and SEL
-
Social and Emotional Learning.  We have attende
d conferences, provided staff 
development on campus after school and provided individual mentoring support through our district Instructional 
coaches.  Staff development activities reflect a planned, focused and coordinated program which addresses both 
ind
ividual and school wide goals. Staff members are involved in the process of identifying areas of need in order to set 
interventions for students during Universal Access and small group instruction time. Staff development activities 
concentrate on improving
 
the school program for students and upgrading skills of the school staff in order to increase 
student achievement. Some of the staff development focused on the needs of English Learners, Math FUN,  Poster 
Method, Next Generation Science Standards and data
 
from our SBAC testing.  We work collaboratively with the district by 
having site teachers represent us at the district Units of Study.  Our focus this year 18
-
19 will be on 3rd grade Impact Team 
training.
