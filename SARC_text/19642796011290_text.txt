on and are recognized for demonstrating one of nine character traits each month: Attentiveness,

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, 
every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
al
l local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities.
 
Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
h
ttps://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardia
ns and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

suring student and staff 
safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster 
drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year. Annually, our school practices a complete 
earthquake drill, which includes an entire school evacuation. All visitors must sign in at the front office,  wear identifica
tion tags while on th
e school 
grounds, and sign out upon departure. Staff perform supervision during recess, and before and after school. Noon supervisors 
are on duty during lunch 
to ensure the safety of all our students. Teachers, staff, and administrators are trained and pra
ctice lock

down procedures that, in an emergency, can 
secure the entire campus.
 
 
A Comprehensive School Safety Plan was developed by the School Safety Committee in order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 19
97. The plan provides 
students and staff a means t
o ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. The Safe School Committee evaluates the plan annually and updates the 
plan as needed.

Based on 
state, district, and local data the primary areas of focus at Magnolia School are improving achievement in reading, math, and
 
writing across the 
curriculum. Grade level teams are provided partial day release time every 6 weeks (each grade level meets on a 
different day) and two early release days 
each month to participate in Professional Learning Communities where teams hold data
-
driven conversations focused on student learning and planning 
how they will respond to the data. Professional development opportu
nities are delivered through grade level collaborations, after school trainings, and 
conference attendance. Teachers are supported during implementation through in
-
class coaching, teacher
-
principal meetings, and collaborations with 
colleagues. Teachers are
 
also provided the needed instructional materials and technology to implement strategies and practices acquired through 
professional development.
 
 
The district annually holds professional development days in which teachers are offered a broad
-
based variety
 
of professional learning opportunities in 
curriculum and instructional practice in support of a continuous cycle of improvement. Professional learning opportunities in
clude grade level and/or 
content
-
specific programming on full and partial days as well a
s after
-
school opportunities. Student achievement data continues to be the determining 
factor in the selection of professional learning topics. The primary areas of focus for professional learning in the last thr
ee years have been in the area of 
supporting
 
teachers as it relates to math, and ELA/ELD, history
-
social science, and science curricula, content standards, frameworks, as well as the use 
of student data to improve instructional practice. Professional learning is developed and facilitated by district
 
staff, Teachers on Special Assignment, as 
well as consultants and coaches who specialize in content
-
area pedagogy. Professional learning is structured in job
-
embedded workshops and 
professional learning communities which include collaborative lesson plann
ing, lesson study, classroom observations and coaching support, and student 
work/data analysis. Professional learning for all teachers includes strategies and pedagogy to support all learners access ri

-
wide professional learning with a
 
focus on instructional 
strategies in support of our three student success drivers: academic discourse, collaborative practices, and cognitive rigor.
 
In addition, several opt
