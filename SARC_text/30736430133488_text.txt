By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent 
Year)
 
 
The Tustin Unified School District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist 
in 
this effort, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School
 
Construction (OPSC). The results of this survey are available at the school office, the District office, or on the Internet a

Tool. The District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to 
keep the
 
school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to 
ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Heritage Elementary is located in the Tustin Legacy development.
  
The school has twenty classrooms, an innovation lab, a 
multipurpose room, and an administration building, with library.  The large property contains two playgrounds, a 
dedicated kindergarten playground and a main playground with new climbing toys and pla
y spaces.  The school has ample 
outdoor learning spaces including a dedicated covered outdoor classroom.
 
 
The school's large field serve as a hub for school and community athletic events after school and on weekends.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Tustin Unified School District provides dedicated time for professional development for all staff.  Schools often provide 
additional professional development time ba
sed on specific school
-
site scheduling and budgetary decisions.  The District 
provides intensive workshops in August during the week before school starts to provide teachers with new knowledge 
and enhanced skills for the upcoming year.  Staff development o
pportunities are also offered after school and by release 
time throughout the school year.  Additionally, professional development is provided one non
-
student day in the fall and 
one afternoon per month after school.  New teachers are provided an extensive
 
new teacher training program throughout 
the year to support their implementation of effective instruction.
 
 
Heritage teachers receive a robust series of professional development courses, both during the summer and after school, 
to plan robust STEAM curric
ulum, integrated with the core curriculum.  In 2016
-
17, teachers participated in professional 
development to learn the Next Generation Science Standards, ELD instruction, STEM
-
Scopes science curriculum, Project 
Based Learning, Cognitively Guided Instructio
n (math) training, STEM teaching methods, technology training, and 
curriculum planning techniques.  In 2017
-
18, in addition to refreshers from the above training, teachers engage in weekly 
professional learning communities to enhance instruction and analyz
e student performance data.  An instructional coach 
and team of support staff meet with staff regularly to provide coaching and guidance in the development of curriculum 
and strategies for STEAM teaching.  New teachers participate in additional training th
rough the teacher induction program. 
The 2018
-
19 focus for professional development was building advanced teaching skills in the area of Cognitively Guided 
Instruction (math).  Teachers work weekly in teams to develop lessons and support students in their 
math learning.  A 
coach provides training and instructional support for all teachers in all subjects, with an emphasis on mathematics.  The 
2019
-
20 focus for professional development is building capacity in writers workshop and conferring in all domains.  
Teachers work weekly in teams to develop lessons and support students in their math learning.  A coach provides training 
and instructional support for all teachers in all subjects, with an emphasis on conferring monthly.  Additionally, teachers 
receive sup
plemental support three times a year from a writing consultant, four half days of time for planning project 
based learning units, and monthly after school PDs.
