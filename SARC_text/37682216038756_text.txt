About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

schedule to ensure a clean and safe school.

The FIT is used on a yearly basis to identify facility needs and repairs.  
All items found in need of repair on the FIT are addressed.  Items that involve 
asphalt, roofing, flooring or painting are addressed through the District's deferred maintenance program.  All other items ar
e expedited into the National

Research shows a high correlation between parent involvement and effective schools.  Parents and community members are es
sential to our educational 
community and are encouraged to be involved in their child's education. Parents are continuously encouraged to play an active
 
role in our Parent and 
Teacher Association (PTA), participate in leadership positions of our District P
arent Advisory Council (DPAC), our School Site Council (SSC), English 
Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), and collaborate in our Positive Behavior Intervention Supports (PBIS) Tier I Committee.
 
 
Our John Otis website (nsd.us) provides a weekly update to ou
r school community about school events and information.  Information is updated daily 
on our John Otis marquee.  All families receive a weekly phone call reviewing the week's announcements. In addition, parents 
receive a monthly School 
Newsletter, and comm
unication via Peachjar.  Coffee with the Principal meetings are held monthly and focus on providing parents with training on 
safety, 
PBIS, school

The selection of focus areas for on
-
going professional development is based on a careful 
analysis of achievement data. The district calendar earmarks 
full days and early release time for providing site
-
based professional development for all teachers. Teachers also have opportunities to attend conferences 
and district
-
wide professional developm
ent throughout the year. During the 2018
-
19 school year, all teachers at John A. Otis will receive approximately 
30 hours of professional development in mathematics through the University of California Irvine subject matter project. This 
professional devel
opment 
will empower our teachers to deliver a cohesive, common core curriculum based on the CCSS. The project includes hands
-
on, research
-
based professional 
development, standards
-
based curriculum guides and unit plans aligned to the Common Core to assist 
our teachers in the implementation of our GoMath 
adoption. The Irvine Math Project team is comprised of classroom practitioners, math content experts, and math education rese
archers. A focus on 
professional development around the area of mathematics and EL
A was selected in response to the needs highlighted in our CAASPP data. In the area of 
language arts, all of our teachers will receive in
-
depth professional development in the California ELA/ELD framework. The ELA/ELD framework 
professional development has
 
been selected as an area of focus due to our high numbers of English language learners and the need for teachers to be 
excellent discerners of curriculum and materials needed to deliver robust and rigorous lessons. Both these areas of focus hav
e been deli
vered through 
teacher release days, bi
-
weekly data team meetings, collaboration days and weekly staff meetings, off the clock offerings and during individual teache
r 
planning days. We have four Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) that provide workshops i
n the area of Language Arts and English Language 
Development. We also have credentialed teachers that provide Engineering is Elementary lessons for students. This provides an
 
opportunity for the 
Language Arts and ELD workshops. With our new English Languag
e Arts adoption, all teachers will receive staff development in the implementation of 
our newly adopted BENCHMARK materials. To support daily, robust and rigorous reading, our district office has adopted the Ame
rican Reading Company 
100 book libraries. All
 
teachers will receive staff development on the implementation and best practices used for these reading baskets for students.
 
Our 
counselors have received training on the Sanford Harmony social
-
emotional curriculum which they will deliver in each classroo
m. Counselors will deliver 
this curriculum in all classrooms while teachers support the implementation and lesson delivery. In addition, all teachers ha
ve received professional 
development on how to run restorative circles in their classrooms in order to d
eliver Tier I positive behavior interventions and supports to all students. 
of focus for teacher training include effective instructional strategies for implementation of Common Core Standards, best pr
actices for Data Teams 
collaboration, ELA Benchmark cur
riculum, curriculum training in writing, language arts and mathematics, as well as specific training to support the needs 
of English Learners. Teachers of students with special needs and teachers of newcomer students also receive specialized train
ing to as
sist them in meeting 
the unique needs of their students. This professional development is provided in various formats, including whole staff group
s, grade
-
level teams, and 
individual mentoring by the school administrator. The District also assists in the c
oordination of BTSA Induction Support for year one and two teachers. 
Teachers who are experiencing difficulty or need improvement have access to the PAR (Peer Assistance Review) Program.
