Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Our Boosters are looking for projects to fund that improve the student 
experience at scho

Last year their goal was to increase student access to technology.
 
 
This year plans are to see how 
we can best support extracurricular activities in art and sports.

-
20)
 
 
Arena Elementary is committed to the safety and security of each student. To maintain these conditions, which contribute 
to the best possible learning environment, school safety issues are discussed as needed on a daily and weekly basis at staff 
meetings. 
The School Safety Plan is reviewed and updated annually and was last reviewed in October, 2019. 
 
The plan includes the following elements:
 

 
Assessment of School Safety: 
Behavioral and discipline data is used to determine actions to reduce incidents of 
crime
.
 
 
 

 
Child
-
abuse reporting:
 
Teachers and all other school employees are required to complete a mandated reporter 
training and are required by law to report any cases of suspected child abuse or child neglect. 
 
Reports are 
investigated by 
Health
 
and Human S
ervices to determine if any follow
-
up on the report is necessary.
 

 
Disaster procedures:
 
A comprehensive Disaster Preparedness Plan has been updated. Practice safety drills are 
held for various kinds of emergency situations (fire, earthquake, lock down). Each classroom has a disaster pack, 
which includes basic first
-
aid supplies and equipment
.
 

 
School discipline:
 
The school discipline plan is given to every student and reviewed throughout the year. Arena 
Elementary holds students accountable for their behavior, and staff members consistently enforce the school
-
wide standards.
 
 
Arena utilizes th
e Positive Behavior Intervention and Support (PBIS) program.
 

 
Procedures to notify teachers of dangerous pupils:
 
If a student is deemed dangerous because of behavior at 
school or behavior outside of school which has been dealt with by county juvenile autho
rities, the teacher(s) of 
the student will be promptly notified of the status of the student. The superintendent and transportation 
supervisor are also notified.
 

 
Sexual
-
harassment policy:
 
Arena Elementary strictly adheres to district policies which prohibi
t sexual harassment 
or discrimination of any kind.
 

 
School
-
wide Dress Code:
 
The primary standards for student dress and grooming include that the student should 
be neat and clean at school, and the student should not wear clothing that compromises safety or
 
modesty or 
that is disruptive to the educational process.
 

 
Safe and orderly environment:
 
Arena Elementary believes a safe and orderly environment is necessary to ensure 
a positive learning experience for all students. Regular supervision of students is the
 
core of creating and 
maintaining a safe and orderly environment.

Arena Elementary has four professional development days. Arena Elementary School teachers have two staff
 
development 
days before the start of school in the Fall plus an additional day in 
November. This enables the staff to be well prepared
 
for the students when they return.
 
 
The fourth professional development day is in March.
 
 
Every Wednesday we have early release days that allow us to explore educational opportunities and discuss and re
flect 
on
 
teaching practices and objectives. Our teachers share methodology and often collaborate on projects.
