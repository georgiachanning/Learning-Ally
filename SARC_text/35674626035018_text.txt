About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The school building, storage structures, playgrounds, and all areas of the school groun
ds consistently receive exemplary reports regarding maintenance, 
condition, and cleanliness.  When safety issues do arise, they are addressed immediately when possible and always within a re
asonable amount of time.  
This year, the only items noted as needi
ng assistance were some loose hanging chain links needing to be cut from the swings and the wood chips needing 
to be replenished in both playground areas.  The chains were cut within a week of the inspection, and the wood chips had alre
ady been planned for
, and 
were filled within six months.  General maintenance and cleaning are conducted by designated staff persons as needed.  The cu
rrent maintenance staff 
person continues to address areas in the classrooms, as well as on the school grounds, that have the 
most direct impact on the health and safety of 
students and staff. A log has been developed to track when these issues are addressed.  This includes, but is not limited to,
 
sanitizing the bathrooms 
three times a week, repairing indoor and/or outdoor items 
immediately once a problem is noted, and clearing dry overgrowth around the perimeter of 
the grounds, reducing the fire hazards during the drier months.
 
 
General cleanliness and upkeep is considered important for the overall pride and comfort of the studen
ts at their school.  Along these lines, the floors 
are waxed regularly and the carpets are professionally cleaned once a year.
 
 
Yearly maintenance on the back
-
flow device (which was installed in 2011 in response to new county requirements) is expected to c
ontinue to happen 
each spring, and will still be provided by the original installation company.
 
 
A new roof was installed to support solar panels and the entire anticipated solar energy project was completed this year.  A 
problem with the sewage 
lines led 
to an inspection, extensive planning, and the creation of a completely new leach field this past year as well.

20)
 
Parents are given many oppo
rtunities to be involved in the educational process of their child/ren.  They are also highly encouraged to participate outsi
de 
the classroom whenever and wherever possible, including assisting as a driver and/or chaperone for field trips.  Weekly notic
es 
are provided to keep 
families up to date with the latest information regarding general school activities. The preferred form of communication (whe
ther handheld flyers sent 
home or as an electronic version sent via emails) is determined by the families.  Mo
nthly Board meetings are announced several days in advance and the 
agenda is posted in a public area to give all interested parties an opportunity to attend.  Family members are invited to run
 
for office when a position on 
the Board comes open.  Parents ar
e also encouraged to take part in the School Site Council and to provide their input at the applicable meetings.  As the 

 
issues th
at could use 
some attention and to build a stronger sense of community and ownership among the families.  As per LCAP & LCFF funding param
eters, a survey is 
presented to all stakeholders (including all students and their families) at least once a year to r
equest feedback on perceived needs of the school and/or 
suggestions to improve services.

toward students with anxiety issues, while still helping staff and students be better prepa
red in the event of any outside intruder alert (including wild 
animals) and/or other lock
-
down situations.  Monthly safety meetings are held with the staff at the school and additional on
-
line safety courses are 

ite.  The Principal assessed the upkeep of the school using the Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT), and Keenan & 
Assoc. conducted their annual safety inspection. No major issues were noted, but there were a few items to be addressed.  Key
 
issues noted, were 
addressed immediately and were resolved to the satisfaction of the Keenan reviewer.  At all times, all necessary cleaning, ma
intenance, and repairs are 
addressed immediately.  Notices regarding health issues in the community and/or vaccination opportunitie

Number of school days dedicated to 
Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
There are no days dedicated specifically to staff development.  The staff members are not required to take any additional cou
rses.  Certificated staff 
attend training sessions and/or conferences on 
their own time when, and if, they feel the information will enhance their ability to do their jobs more 
effectively and/or more efficiently.  An additional benefit to the staff is often the opportunity to collaborate with other e
ducators, which does not ha
ppen 
as often in such a small setting.  Registration for these courses and any additional out
-
of
-
pocket expenses, are paid for by the school with School Board 
approval.  Although the teachers make every effort to attend applicable courses on evenings, week
ends, and holidays, substitute teachers are made 
available whenever necessary for the staff to attend a training during the school day.
 
 
The upper grade teacher (principal) continues to attend a monthly series of courses titled "Math Talks", supported by t
he San Benito County Office of 
Education.  For the past three years, one or both of the current teachers have attended an annual Math conference, conducted 
by California Mathematics 
Council.   In addition, the teacher/principal attends bi
-
monthly LCAP trai
ning meetings, and two years ago did participate in a Dyslexia training, also 
offered through the San Benito COE.  In 2017
-
2018, the two teachers took advantage of an on
-
line training on Autism offered through the UC Davis Mind 
Institute, and the entire st
aff (certificated and classified) participated in a course titled, "Autism & Evidence Based Practices".  Last year, the lower
 
grade 
teacher attended a training about mental wellness and "Creating Safe Learning Environments."  On
-
line safety training course
s are also completed by all 
the staff,  as offered and directed by Keenan and Associates.
