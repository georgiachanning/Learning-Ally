By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Hans Christensen Middle School serves students in grades 6, 7, and 8. The student population is
 
varied both ethnically and 
socio
-
economically, creating a unique and culturally rich setting, which can be viewed as a representation of the outside 
world. At HCMS, students learn to work together, collaboratively in positive teams.  Our students understa
nd that 
teamwork requires respecting differences while maintaining individuality. As a school, we reach out and work in unison 
with our school and community partners, such as ELAC (English Language Advisory Committee), and SSC (School Site 
Council).
 
 
Colle
ctively, the HCMS staff worked together to create our current vision:
 
 
Hans Christensen Middle School will be a place where students and staff feel safe and respected. Through meaningful 
connections, we will provide an academically challenging atmosphere t
hat fosters creativity through the lens of college 
and career readiness. With support and encouragement, students will reach their true potential.
 
 
Our purpose is firmly cemented in our fundamental belief that with the supports and guidance, both academica
lly and 
socially, all students can learn and achieve greatness. We strive to provide a productive, positive, and optimal learning 
environment where all stakeholders are partners in the education and success of our students. We take the education of 
our stu
dents very seriously; it is not merely a job to teach but rather a passionate commitment to educate, transform, and 
empower students to choose a successful path now and in their future.
 
 
At Hans Christensen Middle School, the education, social
-
emotional gr
owth, and well
-
being of our students come first. 
The teaching staff at Hans Christensen is committed to the full implementation of the Common Core State Standards and 
providing hands
-
on learning opportunities that promote critical thinking within a welcomi
ng and caring learning 
environment. Additionally, the HCMS staff understands the adolescent developmental stages of our students and provides 
guidance and support as our students navigate these formative years. We are passionate about challenging students 
to 
excel academically and do so by providing rigorous instruction and fostering real
-
world connections through various 
learning opportunities. At HCMS, we work hard to maintain a positive and supportive educational setting as we also focus 
on PBIS (Positiv
e Behavior Intervention Support) as a foundation for student success. Our staff has been trained in PBIS, 
and Restorative practices and whole
-
heartedly engages in positive and productive interactions with students fostering 
relationships, reflection, and s
uccess. Everyone at HCMS follows the ROSE
-
Respect
-
Organization
-
Service
-
Excellence, a 
pillar of expectations school
-
wide. Students are explicitly taught and practice school
-
wide expectations for both behavior 
and academics, which contributes to our positive
, supportive, and engaging HCMS community. Our passionate and 
proactive PBIS committee continues to collaborate, analyze data, and reflect on our school culture, allowing us to make 
decisions and implement strategies for success that are positive, student
-
centered, and beneficial for all. Intervention and 
enrichment classes are offered to students in grades 6
-
8 to support academic and social/emotional growth.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Each Menifee Union School site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP), including a disaster preparedness 
plan annually. A copy of the HCMS Comprehensive School Safety Plan is available for review at the school office. The plan 
includes emergency procedures for natural disasters and campus intruders. Students, teachers, and staff are trained to 
prepare for a wide range of emergencies, and frequent drills help to refine emergency skills, policies, and procedures at 
all school site
s. Also, following each drill, specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to improve 
emergency procedures continually, and therefore enhance campus safety.
 
 
HCMS staff exercises strict adherence to the district adopted safety/site se
curity protocols, which include a

in 
using our Raptor system. HCMS Comprehensive Safety Plan is reviewed annually; the entire staff particip
ates in monthly 
emergency drills and provides feedback.
 
 
Finally, school and district administrators immediately investigate threats of harm. Teachers and administrators seek to 
foster lines of open communication, so students and parents feel comfortable r
eporting inappropriate activity, including 
bullying, harassment, or threats. All HCMS staff take a strong stand against threatening behavior or bullying and 
investigate complaint matters thoroughly.

As a school district, we are focused on increasing academic achievement in English Language Arts and Mathematics along 
with increasing school attendance.   To this end, our professional development strategy is geared to 
increase student 
engagement through the implementation of our district
-
adopted curriculum and the type of interventions we have in 
place.  Site and district leadership teams review achievement data on state and local assessments to make determinations 
on s
taff development and training, to be aligned with yearly goals and projected activities.
 
 
MUSD provides two full days of professional development along with additional days as needed per site and data.  
Additionally, the major areas of focus have been on t
he adopted curriculum and intervention. State and local achievement 
data are used to make determinations. This district provides two full days of professional development along with 
additional days as needed per site and data. Additional days are provided 
before, during, and after school by either 
directors, coordinators, or intervention specialists. Additionally, conferences, workshops, Grade Level PLC, and staff 
meetings are some ways of providing on
-
going professional growth. Many teachers and administra
tors continue to take 
college
-
level courses to enhance their teaching or administrative skills.
