School Description
 
School Description 
 
 
Rocklin Elementary School is one of sixteen schools in the Rocklin Unified School District. The school 
serves students in transitional kindergarten through sixth grade with an enrollment of 575 
students. Rocklin Elementary has a unique
 
demographic that includes: English Language Learners, 
students with disabilities, and a self
-
contained Gifted and Talented Education program.
 
 
The school is located in the center of a stable and supportive community which expresses its values 
towards education through a high level of participation. Rocklin Elementary School opened in 1952, 
at which time it was the only school in the district, and served students from kindergarten through 
eighth grade. 
 
 
The staff of Rocklin Elementary School strives to provide an exemplary learning environment. The 
campus houses a state of the art STEM Lab and an Outdoor Learning Center. Academic learning is 
certainly the primary focus of the school, but commendably, the 
staff operates on the principle that 
a caring environment fosters individual growth. Rocklin Elementary School has focused its 
resources on best practices to build both Career and College Readiness while providing a positive 
environment where social
-
emotio
nal learning is also developed, recognized, and rewarded. In the 
Spring of 2018 and 2019, Rocklin Elementary was recognized at the state level for exemplary 
(Platinum Level) implementation of Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS). 
 
 
Students 
at Rocklin Elementary School are able to approach all facets of their learning with 
confidence and the assurance that this school is their home. Rules of conduct are explicit and result 
in students achieving high levels of intrinsic motivation which leads 
to self
-
directedness, initiative, 
perseverance and grit. These are the characteristics of a successful learner. 
 
 
The staff embraces technology, recognizing that these skills are instrumental to the future success 
of our 21st century learners. In turn, Roc
klin Elementary has acquired significant resources to 
provide students with ample access to technology. Our investment in academics, social emotional 
learning, and the tools and technology we need to assess where we have been and where we are 
going has all
owed Rocklin Elementary School to become a leader in academic excellence.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
 
The mission of Rocklin Elementary School, a richly diverse educational community and leader in 
academic excellence, is to ensure that all students are valued and 
supported in a collaborative 
environment to reach their full potential through a system distinguished by:
 

 
unique opportunities for critical thinking, intellectual curiosity, and technological 
innovation
 

 
a culture of academic, emotional, and social balance
 

 
partnerships with our families and the community.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Rocklin Elementary School opened in 1952.   A new gymnasium and new underground irrigation system were added in 2003.   It ta
kes
 
our entire 
community to help keep our school the #1 place to be in our small community.
 
Safety comes first as we have staff at crosswalks greeting students and parents to start the day and to end the day.  We have
 
several volunteers that help 
keep our cam
pus safe throughout the day by working in our classrooms and helping us along with our staff supervising our recess and lunch
time duties.
 
Our custodial staff and District maintenance staff continually support any repairs to our school.
 
Throughout the year 
our community business partners help us with our school
-
wide garden and Outdoor Learning Center to make sure it is planted, 
cleaned and looking great throughout the year.  We pride ourselves in recycling and going green whenever we can at Rocklin El
ementar
y.
 
Our district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.  To assist in this effort, our d
istrict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction.  District m
aintenance ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school 
sites in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient se
rvice and that emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority.
