Ensuring all students realize their 
full potential.
 
At Juarez Academy of Engineering & Technology we are dedicated to providing an educational 
experience that combines rigorous academic study with the excitement of discovery.  We seek to 
develop in each student the ability and passion to thi

effectively, and use their creative talents in all content areas.
 
 
School Description
 
Juarez Academy of Engineering & Technology is committed to maintaining high expectations and 
promoting academic excellence for

wide behavior expectations: Be Respectful, 
Be Responsible, and Be Ready to Learn.  Our multi

students for a global society that requires levels of information and technological literacy that goes 
far beyond basic knowledge.  Currently, Juarez Academy i

environment, where all students are able to use technology as a personal learning tool every day.  
In addition, we continue to use project

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.
