Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Our school facility has ten modules, main office facility, and multipurpose/cafeteria module. Our main off
ice facility houses 
the health clerk's office, conference room, school offices, library, library storage room, and staff lounge. A team of 
custodians provides regular cleaning. The district provides maintenance and grounds staff for routine upkeep and care
. 
All buildings are in good repair; the campus is maintained to assure that it is clean, safe, and functional. Our campus 
environment is clean and well maintained and thus fully supports teaching and learning. A work order process is in place 
to attend to 
maintenance issues in a timely manner with urgent and emergency repairs given top priority. We have 
adequate classroom and playground space for our students. Data is collected continuously throughout the year using 
SchoolDude, the work order system. The an
nual FIT (Facilities Inspection Tool) completed in September 2019 confirmed 
the school's status in safe condition with only minor maintenance required.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessm
ents for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in t
he administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who 
have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

suspension, expulsion or mandatory expulsion and other school

or expulsion, notification to teachers, sexual harassment policy

for holding a public meeting. The plan has been updated with an addendum guiding the
 
After School Program.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The staff members at Jack Franscioni School are provided with a variety of professional development opportunities. There 
are five district wide full day staff professional development opportunities as well as monthly district wide grade level 
collaboration
 
days. The staff has weekly PD on Tuesday and weekly collaboration on Wednesdays. The staff development 
plan is created with input from site and District staff and is reviewed and approved by the School Site Council members. 
Our needs for professional deve
lopment are based on on
-

the individual needs of our staff members. All professional development training days are also aligned with the Single 

oals and objectives. District and Site Instructional Coaches and Mentor 
teachers provide assistance and trainings for the new teachers. New teachers are given support individually and in groups. 
On early release Wednesdays, our teachers collaborate in Prof
essional Learning Communities (PLCs) as single or mixed 
grade levels, and learn specific techniques, skills, or theories that are unique to their needs.   Topics of focus during 
professional development include: teaching students in poverty areas, English 
Language learning strategies, student 
engagement strategies, language arts, math, technology in the classroom, classroom management strategies, Accelerated 
Reader, and the latest educational research.  Data analysis is used during PLCs to determine the are
a of focus at each 
grade level.
