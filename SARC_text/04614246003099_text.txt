Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Shasta School is located at the north end of Chico, serving the rural/residential community between Commercial Avenue 
and the Butte County line. Altho
ugh enrollment in this K
-
5 school has grown and new construction has modernized the 
campus, parents still regard Shasta as a quiet, country school with its peaceful vista of mountains across the valley.
 
 
Shasta School's mission is to promote high academic 
achievement for all students while instilling values of responsible 
citizenship and respect for others in a safe, enriched environment.
 
 
It is the vision of Shasta Elementary School that with the aid of pupils, parents, staff and community, students will b
ecome 
confident individuals with positive self
-
esteem. They will be respectful; effective communicators; creative problem 
solvers; critical, reflective thinkers; self
-
directed life
-
long learners; and users of current technology. In our vision, all 
students
 
will develop a strong foundation for continual learning by working to high standards and expectations for 
achievement. Accountability will be shared between parents, educators and the students themselves. Our school will 
provide students with a safe and s
ecure learning environment where they will take advantage of a wide variety of 
resources and learning strategies.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Year and month in 
which data were collected:
 
October 2019
 
 
Updated and readily available resources are important if students are to perform at their best in class. The State of 
California adopts textbooks that meet quality standards established by the State Board of Educati
on. The Chico Unified 
School District selects textbooks and other instructional materials from these state adoptions. All of the textbooks 
currently in use meet these standards. They were selected to match the needs of Chico students by a Task Force compri
sed 
of teachers and administrators and approved by the Board of Education. The CUSD convenes curricular task forces to 
review textbooks in core subject areas on the Kindergarten through 8th grade state adopted list concurrent with the 
adoption cycle.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Webster School, a one
-
room schoolhouse, existed on this site from 1867 to 1924. Shasta Union School was built near the 
current site and existed from 1924 to 1969. The cafeteria building was the first building on ou
r current site. Shasta School 
was built in 1963, with two additional classroom buildings added in 1972 and 1976.  While playground space is limited, 
the development of DeGarmo Park has been a welcome addition to Shasta School. Students may arrive no earlie
r than 
7:45 a.m. Supervision is provided for students in the multipurpose room where breakfast is available. Students must be 
picked up after school by 2:50 p.m. Supervision is provided until that time. The Chico Area Recreation District (CARD) 
provides an
 
after
-
school program that runs until 6:00 p.m.  All classrooms have telephones, internet, and intercom.  A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. Each year 
our PTO has paid for a n
umber of improvements including, but not limited to, new carpeting, walls and drapes for our 
classrooms. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe 
school.
 
 
With funding from Measure K, five 
new buildings have been added to the campus to replace all of the portable classrooms. 
A new kindergarten complex has been added with five new classrooms and a new playground. Five new first grade 
classrooms, six intermediate classrooms, and three new seco
nd grade classrooms have been added in addition to a new 
office complex. Additionally, the campus has been reconfigured to create a single point of entry for parents to increase 
student safety. Along with the new classrooms, a new outdoor dining area has b
een added as well as a school garden.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parent 
involvement and support at Shasta are high, with many parents serving as parent volunteers in classrooms and on 
field trips. An active PTO provides support in many ways, with effort directed toward getting the school community 
together for social activitie
s. The school, in conjunction with the PTO, schedules at least one free (non

per month. These events include movie nights, ice cream socials, family math nights, family reading nights and our Sing

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety plan is updated annually in 
accordance with Senate Bill 187. The key elements of the plan include: 
traumatic incidents; imminent danger procedure (Code Red); evacuation/relocation procedure; civil defense/disorder; 
bomb threat/bomb emergency; earthquake; chemical spill; crime in prog
ress; and fire/explosion. The last update was in 
September 2019.
 
 
We continue to explore ways to secure our campus including additional gates/fences to control the ingress/egress to and 
from campus. Visitors to our campus must first come to the office an
d SIGN IN. A visitor will be given a VISITOR BADGE or 
PASS. Volunteers must fill out proper paperwork at the beginning of every year to work in classrooms or drive on field 
trips. The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe,
 
and functional. District and site maintenance 
staff ensure that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed.
