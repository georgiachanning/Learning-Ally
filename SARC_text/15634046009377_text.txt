Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
At Fremont School, student safety is a top priority.  Students are supervised before school by four morning duty aides as 
well as the vice principal and principal.  Students who arrive at the school prior to 7:30 a
.m. are held at the front of the 
school, where they are supervised by aides and administration, or may choose to go to the school library.  At 7:30 all 
students are dismissed to go to either the cafeteria for breakfast or to the playground.  The aides are 
placed throughout 
the campus to ensure appropriate supervision in all areas of the school.  After school, the students are supervised by

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress 
[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or
 
programs 
of study.

All teachers at the Delano Union School District have a
ccess to staff development every school year. These staff 
development opportunities include training in Reading, ELD, Math, Thinking Maps, Writing, and/or Physical Education. 
Every school site is also responsible for providing its staff with staff developm
ent in areas determined by need. The area 
of need is determined by CELDT scores, district benchmark data, and formative assessments. Based on these criteria, 
Fremont holds staff development in English Language Development, Reading, and Math. The Principal 
also meets with 
teachers individually to discuss instructional goals, and administrators observe classroom lessons. Most staff development 
is offered either after school during professional development meetings or during the instructional day with the use 
of 
substitute teachers. Some professional development has been offered during the summer break when school is not in 
session.
