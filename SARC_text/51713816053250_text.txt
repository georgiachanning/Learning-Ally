The purpose of the School Accountability Report Card (SARC) is to provide parents and community 
members with information about the instructional program, academic achievement, facilities, and 
staff in the Franklin Elementary School Dis
trict. Franklin School has a long tradition of academic 
excellence and we welcome the opportunity to share our program with the community.
 
 
The staff at Franklin School believes that each student is unique and deserving of a rich educational 
program. To th
is end, each student is provided with a rigorous core curriculum in language arts, 
mathematics, science, social science, fine arts, and physical education. Exposure to this curriculum 
helps students gain the skills they need to be successful in school and 
in life. We are fortunate to 
have an experienced and knowledgeable staff that is eager to make a difference in the lives of 
children.
 
 
Franklin School has been recognized as a California Distinguished School by the California 
Department of 
Education. This recognition is the result of students attaining high levels of 
performance and sustained growth over time. This award is a direct reflection of the hard work and 
vision of the staff, Board of Trustees, and parents of the Franklin Elementary
 
School District.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Californi
a is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agenc
ies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data repor
ted in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Ins
tructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The Franklin Elementary School District sets a high priority on ensuring that current textbooks and materials are available t

instructional program. On September 11, 2018 the Board of Trustee
s held a Public Hearing and determined that the District had sufficient and good 
quality textbooks and instructional materials pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All textboo
ks at Franklin School are 
selected from a State
-
ap
proved matrix and have been chosen by a committee of teachers, parents, and the administration.  Adoptions are reviewed and 
formally approved by the District Board. Franklin School uses Wonders as the District adopted ELA/ELD program in grades K 

 
5.  Stud
ySync is the  adopted 
ELA/ELD program for grades 6 
-
 
8. In an attempt to align our math curriculum with the California Common Core Standards, the District adopted the 
College Preparatory Mathematics Program (CPM) in the 6th 
-
 
8th grades (adopted July 1, 20
13) and GoMath for Grades K
-
5 (adopted July 1, 2014).  This 
math curricula utilizes problem
-
based learning where students explore, discuss, and make sense of mathematical concepts. A sufficient number of 
textbooks and instructional materials are purchased 
to ensure that each student, including English Learners, has access to their own copy of the 
standards
-
aligned textbook in all the core curricular areas. For grades 7th & 8th, the District has chosen to purchase additional textb
ooks or e
-
books to 
allow stu
dents to access a book at home to reduce the amount of weight they are carrying in their backpacks.
 
 
The Franklin Elementary School District is continually in the process of upgrading the technology that is available to both s
tudents and staff . During the
 
past year a great deal of time and money has been spent to continually upgrade and enhance the computer network to ensure tha
t it continues to meet 
the needs of the educational program. During the 2018

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
It is the belief of the staff, 
administration, and Board of Trustees that the public school should be the centerpiece of the community. Effective educationa
l 
programs, combined with adequate facilities, are essential to creating a positive and safe learning environment for children.
 
The
 
District is committed to 
providing students with a safe, clean, and well
-
maintained facility in which to learn and play. Sufficient custodial time is available to keep buildings and 
grounds clean and well maintained. Currently the District employs three f
ull
-
time custodians.
 
 
Franklin School has never received a formal parent complaint per the Williams Uniform Complaint Procedure and all audits cond
ucted by the Sutter 
County Superintendent of Schools Office have found the District to be compliant in all ar
eas.
 
 
Franklin School has been in operation at its current location since 1864. The oldest buildings presently on campus were const
ructed in 1948. Out of the 
23 classrooms on campus, 14 are permanent buildings and 9 are portable facilities. The two compute
r labs and library are housed in portable buildings.
 
 
A number of major facility improvement projects have been completed at Franklin School over the past 13 years. These major pr
ojects have created a 
physical environment that is conducive to student learn
ing and success as well as extracurricular activities. A track and field project was completed during 
the summer of 2015.  Costs for the track and field were funded from the General Fund. Two new portable buildings were added t
o the campus during 
June 2016
, adding more classroom space for students including the After School Program.
 
 
During he summer of 2018 a new parking lot was constructed at Franklin School. This new parking facility added an additional 
62 parking spaces, new 
handicapped parking, sidewal
ks, lighting, landscaping and drainage.  The total cost of the project was $555,741.  The project was funded by a Facility 
Hardship Grant, support from the Sutter County Public Works Department, and the District's General Fund.  This new parking fa
cility h
as enhanced the 
safety of the staff, students, parents, and visitors who come to Franklin School on a regular basis.
 
 
The District currently operates its own food service program offering meals to both students and staff that comply with the n
utrition stan
dards 
established by the United States Department of Agriculture for the National School Lunch Program.
 
 
A facility plan is being created to address the needs of the campus for, at least, the next five years.

however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Franklin School takes a great deal of pride in the fact that we provide students with a safe an
d organized environment in which to learn and play. Nothing 
is more important to us than providing students with a safe physical environment, coupled with a school climate that is free 
of violence, intimidation, 
fear, and shaming.
 
 
Because school safety is
 
such a high priority, we are constantly in a state of evaluating and critiquing our safety procedures and policies. We regula
rly 
conduct safety inspections of the site and playground and make corrections as needed. The School Safety Plan is updated at th
e
 
beginning of each school 
year and is reviewed with staff.  The last update and review was in August 2019. Emergency Response Binders are located in al
l classrooms for immediate 
use during an emergency. These binders have copies of all the necessary forms 
and directions to utilize in an emergency situation.
 
 
The District recognizes that an effective communication network is an important aspect of student safety. Franklin Elementary
 
School has a schoolwide 
telephone system to facilitate communication and inc
rease student and staff safety. In addition, wireless radios allow instant communication between 
yard duty supervisors, custodians, office staff , and administration. In an effort to further enhance safety and the maintena
nce of student information, a 
stud
ent management software program is networked throughout the school and is utilized by both the office and teaching staff . Th
is software program 
enables the staff to quickly retrieve student information in case of an emergency. The District also utilizes t
he services of an internet
-
based 

 
a prerecorded message 
in a very short period of time. This system is regularly used for general i
nformational messages as well.
 
 
Fire, earthquake, bus evacuation, and disaster drills are conducted monthly throughout the school year. Exit maps are develop
ed and clearly posted in 
all classrooms. When students are on the playground, adequate adult superv
ision is always provided. All playground supervisors have received training 
in CPR, first aid, school safety, and playground discipline. This team is continually watching children to ensure that they a
re conducting themselves in a 
safe and responsible mann
er. All employees at Franklin School monitor those who enter and exit the school site.  In an effort to limit access to the s
chool 
site during the school day, all gates are locked after the start of the school day.  The only exception to this is the front 
gate near the school office.  All 
visitors are required to check in at the main office upon entering the campus. Visitors are given badges that must be worn at
 
all times while they are on 
the school site.
 
 
School security cameras were installed over a two 
year period (2018 
-
 
2019, 2019 
-
2020).  The cameras provide an additional level of campus safety.  The 
cameras allows designated staff members to review student misconduct as well as any campus disturbance that might occur durin
g evening hours and/or 
on th
e weekends/holidays.
