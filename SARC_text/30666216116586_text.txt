By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Running Springs Elementary School is one of 27 elementary schools in the Orange Unified School District.  The school was 
established in July of 1999 and is located in a 
residential neighborhood in Anaheim Hills.  Running Springs consists of thirty 
classrooms, six portable classrooms, a multi
-
purpose building, and an administration building.  The administration building 
contains offices, the staff lounge and workroom, the 
STEAM lab, and library.  Approximately 700 students were enrolled 
in grades transitional kindergarten through sixth including general education and special education during the 2018/2019 
school year.  Running Springs students are fortunate to have the oppo
rtunity to learn from the variety of ethnic and 
cultural backgrounds that make up our diverse population.
 
 
Running Springs provides the following number of instructional minutes with a modified Wednesday schedule: 
Kindergarten
-
 
295 minutes,  grades 1 to 3
-
 
295 minutes, and grades 4 to 6
-
 
320 minutes.  Grades K
-
6 each have 245 minutes 
of instruction every Wednesday to allow for professional development and teacher collaboration to plan instruction that 
prepares students for the 21st century.
 
 
The school has 
a significant technology infrastructure as part of its design.  As a result teachers are able to use a variety of 
technology resources as instructional tools including; a STEAM Lab, classroom computers, and hand held devices.  These 
devices allow each stud
ent with the opportunity to develop computer skills necessary as our students move to middle and 
high school.  School
-
wide technology is also used to access diagnostic and periodic assessments that support each 
student's individual needs.
 
 
During the 2018/
2019 school year, teachers were provided support to develop their expertise in differentiated instruction, 
while incorporating 21st century skills that target student communication, collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking. 
 
As a result, students w
ere provided with rigorous instruction that aligned with the Common Core State Standards.  To 
meet the individual needs of students, benchmark assessments were used to reflect and determine the individual support 
each student required to be successful.  Su
pport was provided through small group instruction in the classroom and after 
school tutoring.
 
 
Student leadership plays an important part in our school community.  Students can exhibit leadership abilities through 
classroom jobs and the opportunity to lea
d projects.  In addition, upper grade students can apply to be selected for Student 
Council. This group of students are role models for their peers and support spirit days and lunch activities.  Another 
opportunity for students to participate in leadership
 
is through our Peer Assistance and Leadership program (PAL). 
Students in the PAL program are dedicated to working as a group to solve issues on campus and design and implement 
community projects to better our school.
 
 
Running Springs is committed to providing a success
-
oriented and safe learning environment for all students.  The teaching 
staff encourage parents to become involved and familiar with their children's school. We welcome and depend on the 
strong parent invo
lvement to provide a team approach to our children's education.
 
 
Vision Statement:
 
The staff and community of Running Springs Elementary School are dedicated to providing a quality education which will 
empower all students to achieve academic success, embrace life
-
long learning, and become productive citizens.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The school opened in 1999, and was built ADA compliant. Technology infrastructure was included in the design, and each 
class has cabling for several inter
net connections. Classrooms are designed around smaller pods, allowing easy facilitation 
of small group instruction. There are adequate classrooms for all students. There are six portables on campus, each 
meeting the safety standards.
 
 
Maintaining the appearance, safety, and functionality of Running Springs is a priority for staff and parents. One part
-
time 
and two full
-
time custodians maintain the site each day.  The school grounds are kept clean and well manicured.  The site 
administra
tor and day custodian monitor the site daily to identify any areas that could be of danger to the students or 
staff.  Four times a year the administrator and custodian are required to conduct a thorough site inspection and submit a 
report to Risk Managemen
t.  The district makes requested repairs in a timely manner and schedules for the site differed 
maintenance as needed.
 
 
Running Springs is a closed campus; night lights and locked gates are utilized to eliminate vandalism.  Local youth 
organizations use th
e multi
-
purpose room after school and on weekends.
 
 
The following information is taken from the July 9, 2018, Facility Inspection Tool (FIT).  The overall condition of our schoo
l

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We are proud of the customer service we provide and the parent/staff collaboration that makes Running Springs an 
amazing school.  The staff embraces parent involvement to develop a partnership to support their child's education.  We 
encourage parents to pa
rticipate in their child's education by volunteering in the classroom,  joining the PTA, EFAH, and 
serving on school committees. Throughout the year the PTA and school work together to enrich our students' learning 
experience.
 
 
We are fortunate to have an 
active PTA at Running Springs that works as a team to coordinate a successful fundraiser at 
the beginning of the year that funds multiple learning opportunities for our students.  Our PTA provides enrichment 
assemblies on site that are grade level specific
 
and support the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). Each grade level 
participates in a social studies or science assembly sponsored by the PTA. Additionally, all students participate in Art 
Masters to develop an understanding of different artists who have
 
impacted our world.  In order to recognize students' 
positive behavior and achievement, PTA provides awards and incentives. Birthday Book Club provides hundreds of books 
to our school library for all students to have access to daily. We are fortunate to h
ave a PTA that provides our students 
with the opportunity to be exposed to amazing enrichment programs, incentives, and academic materials.
 
 
In addition to enrichment programs PTA provides events that bring the community together.  The PTA coordinates the 
annual Family Fun Night, Run
-
A
-
Thon, Family Bingo Night, December Crafts, Bike Rodeo, Red Ribbon Week, and Talent 
Show. They also partner with the site administrator to keep the community informed through home
-
school 
communication via monthly newsletters, 
phone messages, school website, emails, school marquee, weekly 
communication folders, and parent meetings. PTA meetings are held every month where all parents are welcomed and 
encouraged to take part in their child's education.
 
 
The Education Foundation of
 
Anaheim Hills (EFAH) provides fundraising towards innovation and technology. These 
fundraising efforts have yielded infrastructure to lead our school into a 21st Century Education, the Fours Cs, and to help 
students prepare to be college and career ready.
Additionally, EFAH has formed an active Dad's Club, which supports our 
student body with various projects around campus.
 
 
Running Springs parent volunteers coordinate the 4th
-
6th grades outdoor school fundraisers to ensure all students attend 
the camp in t
he sixth grade.  They assist in the library, vision and hearing screening, school pictures, school directory and 
yearbook. Parent volunteers are also a vital part of the daily instructional program at Running Springs.  Many parents 
volunteer their time in 
the classroom to prepare instructional materials, assist teachers to monitor small group instruction, 
and chaperone field trips and special events/programs.
 
 
In addition to the outstanding PTA support, Running Springs also offers a cultural awareness night
, known as Around the 
World Family Night.  This allows students and families to share their ethnic backgrounds through food, art, and dance.   
Lastly, the school invites community members to join in Read Across America Day, which celebrates reading and 
com
munity involvement on Dr. Seuss' birthday.
 
 
The teachers at Running Springs are very involved with the parents and community.  They coordinate parent/teacher 
conferences in the fall, encouraging parents to come into the classroom and learn about all the ex
citing things their 
children will learn during the year and to build a relationship with the teacher.  Kindergarten teachers put on a  
"Kindergarten Round Up" prior to the first day of the school year to give incoming Kindergartners and their families a 
ch
ance to experience school the day before it officially begins. Teachers continually stay connected with parents through 
several means: class newsletters, notes, e
-
mails, phone calls, Blackboard, Dojo, and Parent Portal.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 


 
32289, a Comprehensive 
Safe School Plan particular to their site. Each school site is required annually, by March 1st, to have reviewed, and if 
necessary, updat
ed their Safe School Plan. Each school forwards its Safe School Plan to the district through the office of 
Student and Community Services (SCS). The office of SCS provides plan development assistance to the schools and 
maintains a file of individual school
 
plans available for inspection by the public.
 
 
A comprehensive disaster plan is in effect and fire, earthquake, or lock
-
down drills are conducted monthly. All school 
members are assigned to a specialized team including the Command Center, Search and Rescu
e, First Aide, 
Assembly/Parent Assistance, and Security/Site Operations.  All schools in the district are linked through an emergency 
radio contact system, and district radio drills are held periodically to ensure we are prepared for an actual disaster or 
emergency.  The Running Springs Elementary School Comprehensive School Safety Plan includes the following goals: 
Component One
-
People and Programs Goal 1: To provide a respectful and safe school environment, Goal 2: To meet the 
unique behavioral, academic,
 
and cultural needs of all students; Component Two
-
 
Places Goal 1: Develop school pride that 
will encourage students and the community to maintain a clean and safe campus; Goal 2: To maintain effective disaster 
preparedness procedures. This plan is created
 
and monitored by the School Site Council and reviewed with the faculty 
each fall and periodically during the school year as we practice the components of the plan. Our Safe School Plan was 
updated and reviewed in March 2019.

Running Springs is a closed c
ampus and visitors must check
-
in through the office. The school gates are locked at 8:05 and 
remain locked until the the end of the school day. All visitors must sign in and out through the Envoy system in the office. 
The site administrator and teachers mo
nitor students before school, after school, and during recess. The safety committee 
meets bi
-
monthly to address any concerns and make the necessary changes.  During lunch recess we have five lunch 
supervisors that monitor students on the playground, field 
and lunch tables to ensure safety. The site administrator meets 
regularly with the lunch supervisors to identify any issues that need to be addressed. To ensure the safety of students 
before and after school the city of Anaheim provides two crossing guards
.  The site administrator utilizes the School 
Messenger phone system, school website, and PTA newsletter to communicate our school pick
-
up and drop
-
off 
expectations to create an efficient and safe environment for students.
 
 
We try to keep a positive campus
 
but in the event a child does not demonstrate positive behaviors parents are notified by 
a behavioral referral that must be signed by a parent and returned the next day.  If a student has a major behavior violation
 
then the site administrator will meet wi
th the child, talk with the parent, and provide appropriate consequences which 
follow the guidelines of Education Code.
