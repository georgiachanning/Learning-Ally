School Description
 
 
Message From Principal
 
Welcome to Loma Vista Elementary, home of the Leopards. As Principal, I am committed to 
providing a nurturing learning environment where students have the opportunity to develop their 
skills to think critically, solve problems and communicate effectively. 
It is my belief that a wonderful 
learning experience is created by building strong relationships with parents, students, and 
community partners.  Our school provides a positive culture which fosters respect, responsibility, 
resiliency and kindness.  These 
positive character traits provide support to teach students skills and 
behaviors necessary to succeed now and in the future.
 
 
It is my hope that you will acquire a strong understanding of the learning and excitement our 
students experience every day. I am 
honored to work with a highly dedicated staff, amazing 
students, and parents; together we build a powerful foundation for learning.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, ev
ery school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all 
local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. A
dditionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability
 
of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

Brentwood Union Elementary held a public hearing on Sept. 11, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had s
ufficient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or s
cience lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in t
he classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the
 
State are reviewed by all teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. 
The table displays information collected in Sept. 11, 2019 about the quality, 
currency, and availability of the standards
