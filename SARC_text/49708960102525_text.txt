By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description
 
Rincon Valley Charter School (RVCS) is located on two campuses, one on the Sequoia Elementary School campus, one on 
the M
atanzas/Spring Creek Charter campus in Santa Rosa, California. Our charter school provides excellence in middle 
school education in a small, secure atmosphere, where students hold themselves to high academic and personal 
standards. Our Project
-
Based Learni
ng environment bridges all areas of the curriculum and units of study are based on 
Common Core and California State standards. Our charter school is unique, as each of our 330 middle school students is 
equipped with a laptop computer that connects them to 
the global learning community. Our technology
-
driven curriculum 
gives students the tools they will need to become leaders and productive citizens in the 21st century.
 
Our experienced and dedicated staff is accessible and approachable. We believe when home 
and school communicate 
effectively, student success rates rapidly rise. RVCS students are on a constant growth trajectory filled with innovation, 
challenge, and recognition.
 
In addition to our vibrant core of subject content areas, RVCS students can partic
ipate in an award
-
winning band and 
technology electives. Fine arts, championship athletics, and elective courses provide students the opportunity to shine in 
multiple environments. This was formally highlighted with a 2007 California Distinguished School A
ward.
 
 
Purpose Statement
 
The purpose of Rincon Valley Charter School is to provide an excellent and challenging technology
-
empowered program 
in a small school setting.  We provide a student
-
centered, project
-
based learning environment in which technology, 
fine 
arts, inquiry, and service learning are the foundational components.  We differentiate our instruction to meet the 
academic needs of all students.  We strive to develop a 21st century learner by building relationships, using critical 
thinking, and eng
aging curriculum to meet academic standards.  To ensure the success of our purpose, we will measure 
and evaluate our efforts using state, district, and school standards. We are here to inspire students to be self
-
motivated, 
competent, lifelong learners and
 
exemplary citizens with the help and guidance of the entire school community.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the preventative measures and repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and wo
rking order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that 
emergency repairs and safety are given the highest priority.   A specific maintenance worker is assigned to each site to 
help assure the school'
s needs are being met.
 
 
During the 2004
-
05 school year, local bond funds, Measure D, and state matching funds were used to modernize all schools 
with the exceptions of Austin Creek, which was constructed in 2000, and Village School. Village School's multi
-
use facility 
and playground area have been recently modernized, as well as recent replacement of carpeting, lighting, and various 
other updating.  All classrooms in the other five schools received new wall surfaces, paint, lighting, cabinetry, heating 
syst
ems, upgraded electrical systems, window coverings, flooring, and marker boards. Each multi
-
use facility was also 
completely modernized. State of the art library media centers and kindergarten complexes were built, and the 
administrative wing of each schoo
l was modernized to include small classrooms for special student programs, a staff room, 
office, and conference rooms.

During the summer of 2015, local bond funds, Measure F and local reserves were utilized for modernization of the 
Matanzas campus.  Inclu
ded were upgraded HVAC systems, energy efficient windows, a remodeled office complex, and 
play field improvements.  The RVCS
-
Matanzas campus received the new construction of several classrooms, including a 
shared music building.  In August 2017 the Madrone
 
and Binkley campuses opened up a new building with 6 classrooms 
and a music room.  A new play field, along with energy efficient windows and other improvements were made to the 
campuses.  In August of 2018 Village opened up with a major renovation to the 
classrooms, new classroom buildings, a 
new play field and play structure, and landscaping improvements.  School security improvements have also been made at 
some of the schools, with the other schools to be completed in the next two years.  All schools hav
e now received air 
conditioning as of August 2018.  All other schools will receive improvements through this bond program over the next 
couple of years.  The Governing Board has identified the following as key goals for the Measure F program. To ensure the
 
schools offices are easily located but the public, to replace portable classrooms with modular and/or stick built permanent 
buildings, and to upgrade energy efficiency components such as HVAC, lighting, and window systems.
 
 
Cleaning standards have been ad
opted for all schools in the district. On a regular basis, the Maintenance and Operations 
supervisor meets with the custodial staff and often visits sites to ensure the cleaning standards are being upheld. In 
addition, the principal communicates daily with
 
the custodial staff to ensure a clean and safe school.  The district is 
proactive with maintenance needs and annually updates its deferred maintenance plan.   Work under this plan includes 
roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, 
interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress 
[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or
 
programs 
of study.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development an

Professional development opportunities are directly correlated to district goals and the Local Control Accountability Plan 
(LCAP). With a focus on High Quality Instruction (HQI), we provide teachers with three full
-
days of annual inservice, 
monthly "Distri
ct Wednesday" workshops on topics of interest/need (8 total), approximately 20 district
-
sponsored after 
school trainings annually, and 2
-
3 planning days throughout the year. A critical component of our professional 
development plan is coaching and mentorin
g through our Consulting Teacher program.  In addition, professional 
development opportunities are offered through attendance at Sonoma County Office of Education classes and educational 
conferences. For 2017
-
18, our topics of focus are English Language De
velopment, Project
-
Based Learning, Technology 
Skills, Common Core ELA and Math standards implementation, and an incremental roll out of the Next Generation Science 
Standards. On
-
going professional development at RVCS includes school
-
wide faculty participat
ion in Professional Learning 
Communities, site membership to the California League of Middle Schools, and regular participation in site, district, and 
county level professional development centering on the Common Core Standards and teaching best practices.

We use both district benchmark data and summative state
-
wide data to monitor our progress towards
 
these goals.  For 
example, when reviewing on
-
going academic growth for our English learners we use the RenLearn STAR Reader 
assessment 3 times per year to gauge student progress to make just in time instructional decisions to support students 
not meeting 
grade level expectations, and we analyze data from the ELPAC and the SBAC to review the effectiveness of 

math progress by reviewing Eurek
a Math end
-
of
-
module assessments, students in grades 1
-
6 also take MobyMax 
placement tests two times per year, and students in grades 3
-
6 take the SBAC summative assessment 1 time per year.
 
 
Professional development opportunities are directly correlated to
 
district goals and the LCAP. With a focus on High Quality 
Instruction (HQI), we provide teachers with three full
-
days of professional development trainings, 2
-
3 grade level planning 
days yearly, 8 monthly "District Wednesday" professional development sess
ions, and approximately 20 district
-
sponsored 
after school trainings.   Teachers can also attend professional development opportunities through Sonoma County Office 

 
 
Teachers are supported in meeting our 
LCAP goals with coaching and mentoring through our Consulting Teacher Program, 
teacher
-
principal meetings, and grade level PLC teams.  The support is focused analyzing student assessment data to plan 
curriculum and make instructional choices which support 
teacher and student growth.
 
 
During the 2017
-
18 school year the district administration and school site principals participated in professional 
development through the Center for Education Leadership (CEL).  A CEL trainer led several workshop sessions with
 
the 
administration team where the focus was on the 5 Dimensions of Teaching and Leadership.  The administration team 
observed in classrooms as part of the training and collaborated together on what high quality instruction is and how to 
look for this in o
ur classrooms.  For the 2018
-
19 school year we expanded this professional development to include two 
teachers from each school site, and in addition to this the administration team is continuing to receive further professional
 
development in the framework 
through CEL.
