About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System
, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and gr
ade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive
 
disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or
