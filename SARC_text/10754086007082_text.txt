About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publis
h a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a
 
Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent w
ith data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abou
t the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal 
or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Plann
ed Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our district does a great job keeping our classrooms technologically updated and clean. Each classroom has Internet access an
d almost all have smart 
boards. In addition, all classrooms have the tools and supplies requeste
d by the teachers to support both instruction and learning.
 
 

le Elementary finished this 
year a remodeling process which will inclu
de the addition of classrooms and upgrades throughout the site. In addition, ongoing small changes have 
occurred to the facility to address safety. Our school has 28 classrooms and zero portables. The buildings are cleaned each e
vening by a two
-
person 
main

for other needs. On 
site, there is a library. All 4
-
6 classrooms are equipped with a class set of laptops. In 7th
-
8th grade there a
re a class set of laptops in all English classes 
and Science classes. Social Science and Math within 7th
-
8th grade share a set of classroom laptops. One of the classrooms is our music room. Choral 
groups and the band meet in this classroom. In addition, st
udents in grades 4
-
6 also meet in this classroom in the afternoons for music instruction.
 
 
Lastly, our students are able to exercise and play on our basketball, volleyball, and field hockey courts along with our socc
er, football, baseball, and 
softball fie
lds. Student safety is always a priority. The school has a perimeter fence and visitors are required to enter through the off
ice. School policy 
requests that students not be at school until 8:00 a.m., when teachers have daily supervision duty. After school
, teachers and administration help 
supervise students as they leave school or line up for the afterschool program.
 
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by Riverdale Joint Unified to ensure all classrooms and facilities are mainta
ined to a degre
e of 
adequacy that provides for good learning. Facilities have been inspected and are free of any gas, electrical, heating, sewage
, pest, safety, structural, and 
hazardous material program.
 
 
Senate Bill 550, better known as the Williams Settlement, require
s districts and school sites to provide data on the maintenance of facilities. Maintenance 
data for this element of the SARC is based on the inspection report of each school site.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

School Safety 
Plan
 
School Safety
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Riverdale Elementary 
School. The school is in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations 
pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The 
school

s disaster 
preparedness plan included steps for ensuring students 
and staff during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a 
regular basis throughout the school year. The plan was adopted by the 
Board in December 2019.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety P
lan Process & Templates is designed to 
be utilized as a school resource for prevention/mitigation, preparedness, 
response and recovery planning and training as well as functioning as a 
template for meeting the requirements for the annual Safety Plan Proces
s 
under SB 187 and the National Incident Management System. It is designed 
to be an electronic or hard copy Safety Plan. In 1998, the comprehensive 
Safe School Plan was first developed by the district in consultation with the 
Fresno County Office of Educat
ion to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) 
of 1997. Assembly Bill 1747 in 2018 added that First Responders be 
included in the systematic planning process. Schools shall review and 
update the comprehensive school safety plan by March 1st of each year. 
The 
plan provides students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly 
learning environment. Each school includes the following requirement of 
SB 187, along with the components of the Comprehensive School Safety 
Plan (EC 32281): 
 

 
Child Abuse Reporting Pro
cedures (EC 35294.2 [a] [2]; PC 
32281)
 

 
Disaster Procedures, both routine and emergency (EC 35295
-
35297; GC 8607 and 3100)
 

 
School Suspension, Expulsion and Mandatory Expulsion 
Guidelines
 

 
Procedures to Notify Teachers of Dangerous Pupils (EC 
49079)
 

 
Sexual Ha
rassment Policies (EC 212.6 [b])
 

 
School
-
wide Dress Code Relating to Gang
-

Procedures for Safe Ingress and Egress of Pupils, Parents, and 
School Employees to and from School (EC 35294.2)
 

 
A Safe and Orderly School Environment Conduc
ive to 
Learning (EC 35294.2)
 

 
School Discipline Rules and Consequences (EC 35291 and EC 
35291.5)
 

 
Hate Crime Reporting Procedures and Policies
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and updates it as needed. The plan 
was reviewed with staff in August 2019 
and will be revisited in the spring 
of 2020. An updated copy is available to the public at the school site.

Riverdale Joint Unified School District has continued the focus of staff professional development on the instructional needs 
of English Learners, and has 
expanded to the areas of balanced literacy (reading/writing). Each school site establishes a focus for
 
their staff/students based on identified needs. This 
commitment to professional development and continuous growth has allowed each grade level and/or subject level department to 
take part in focused 
professional development. Collectively, 33 days were dev
oted in 2017
-
18, 36 days in 2018
-
2019 and 33 days committed for the 2019
-
2020 school year. 
 
 
In reviewing various sources of student achievement data, a year
-
long plan for professional development for 2019
-
2020 was designed to improve 
instructional process
es and to produce improved student learning and higher student achievement. This plan consisted of the following:
 

 
Learning about and understanding the State Standards to provide standards
-
based instruction
 

 
English Language Arts with a focus on reading and 
writing strategies
 

 
Instructional Strategies for increasing academic achievement of Special Education students
 

 
Curriculum calibration training, results, and monitoring grade
-
level instruction
 

 
Examination of the new California Standards for ELA/Literacy and 
Math along with Next Generation Science Standards
 

 
Analysis implementation of ELA/Literacy and Math ELD Standards.

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students 
who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the s
tandard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments
.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested inc
ludes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of students tested 
is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated us
ing only students who received scores.
