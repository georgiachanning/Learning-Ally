About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca

The School S
afety Plan was presented and approved by the School Site Council on September 19, 2019.
 
 
Regular site emergency drills are conducted on a monthly and/ or quarterly basis (e.g., fire, earthquake, lock
-
downs, and shelter in place).  Additionally, 
the Raptor 
visitor management system is in operation at our school, which screens visitors against the Megan's Law database and other st
ates' databases 
as well.  Casillas also participates in six Districtwide Emergency Radio Drills each year.
 
 
Student safety and well
-
being is promoted via multiple activities throughout the school year.  In addition, Casillas offers other activities designed
 
to foster 
teamwork, athletic skills, positive attitudes and self
-
esteem.  Provisions and supplies for emergency evacuations have 
been obtained and a 
comprehensive evaluation plan is in place. Playground supervision, drug and alcohol abuse prevention programs, child abuse aw
areness, and School 
Safety Patrol also promote student safety.  Supportive and alert staff consistently monitor
s classroom environments to maintain student safety.  Parents 
pick students up at designated areas.  Traffic control is provided by the school Safety Patrol, who utilizes the School Resou
rce Officer as a valuable 
resource.
