Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Cox Elementary School was originally constructed in 1970 and is currently comprised of 31 classrooms, a computer lab, a 
library, a music room, and a spacious playground.  The campus underwent a modernization project between 2003 and 
2006, at which time all
 
facilities were thoroughly renovated.  In addition, during the 2019
-
20 school year, there are 
significant improvements being made to the Cox campus including the installation of air conditioning in all classrooms.  
The most recent improvements to the scho
ol include technology upgrades to all classrooms. Each classroom is equipped 
with a surround
-
sound microphone system, touch
-
screen displays, and a document camera.  The facility strongly supports 
teaching and learning through its ample classroom and recrea
tional space.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 

Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the District. Basic cleaning operations ar
e performed on a daily 
basis throughout the school year with an emphasis on classrooms and restrooms. A joint effort between students and 
staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

lop 
sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair:
 

complex maintenance funct
ions occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is 
administered by Fountain Valley School District's Maintenance & Operations Department to ensure that school grounds 
and facilities remain in excellent repair.  A work 
order process is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. 
Emergency repairs are given the highest priority; repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which they 
are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
Deferred mainte
nance includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. Fountain Valley School District did not participate in the State School Deferred Maintenance 
Budget Program. Fountain Valley 
School District sets aside funds each year to specifically address deferred maintenance 
needs. The passing of Measure O provided additional, much
-
needed funds for these types of projects.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Cox School.  Students are supervised before/after school, during 
lunch/recess periods, by teachers, administrators, trained aides, and classified staff. All visitors to the campus must sign 
in at the
 

on school grounds.
 
 
The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and State earthquake 
standards. The Safety Committee reviews and updates the Safe School Action Plan each year by March 1st. Any and all 
revisions to the plan are immediately communicated to classified and certificated staff.
 
 
The Goals and Objectives in the Safe School Action
 
Plan focus on three areas:
 
1)  A school climate characterized by caring and connectedness,
 
2)  The safe and orderly physical environment of the school, and
 
3)  The health and wellness of students.
 
 
To supplement the Safe School Action Plan, every 
school also has a disaster preparedness plan that includes steps for 
ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire, disaster, and lockdown drills are conducted on a rotating basis 
throughout the school year.  The safety plan is reviewed in earl
y March and discussed with the staff during our Fall Full 
Simulation Disaster Drill.
 
 
For the 2019
-
2002 school year, Cox Elementary along with all the schools in the Fountain Valley School District (FVSD) 
participated in a full staff development day on Nov
ember 8, 2019 around safety.  The focus of this training day was to 
introduce staff to the Titan HST app, conduct first aid training, disaster scenario discussion, complete an emergency bin 
inventory, and review of the updated disaster plan with over 65 em
ployees associated with our school took place.
