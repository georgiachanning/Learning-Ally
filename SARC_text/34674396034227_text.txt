School Description
 
Phoebe Hearst Elementary School is an academic prep school that develops excellence through 
emphasis on a strong foundation in mastering academic standards and good behavior.  The Phoebe 
Hearst School community, staff, parents and students work as a team t
o build excellence in both 
academics and citizenship. We empower students through authentic leadership opportunities, 
independence and responsibility.  We are committed to the idea that all students are capable of 
achieving excellence.  We provide a positi
ve, supportive and structured environment to meet the 
needs of all students through the following programs.
 
 
Basic Program:  A major emphasis of the Basic school program is the development of academic 
skills and good study habits.  Students must meet admis
sion criteria to be accepted to the lottery 
for the Basic program at Phoebe Hearst. Academic achievement at or above grade level, good 
behavior, and satisfactory attendance are all required.  The overall goal and responsibility of the 
school staff is to br
ing together the most successful traditional and new methods of instruction 
which emphasize academic skills and good study habits.  Parents and staff members work together 
in the planning and implementation of the program.  Parental support at home contrib
utes to 

teachers creates ideal conditions for student learning and high levels of achievement.
 
 
GATE:  Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) supports excellence i
n the Sacramento City Unified 
School District through a program that specifically addresses the needs of gifted children. The 
program at Phoebe Hearst provides not only instruction in basic skills, but enrichment, acceleration, 
and in
-
depth learning experi
ences for the more academically able student. All first grade students 
are tested in the spring for GATE eligibility throughout the district.  Students are then placed at 

 
 
The staff at
 
Phoebe Hearst believes that cooperation between the home and school is essential to 
the success of students in our programs. To promote understanding and commitment to the goals 
of the program, a 3
-
way contract between the parent, student and teacher is i
mplemented. The 
contract outlines important expectations for students, parents and staff.
 
 
When enrolling students in our Basic or GATE program, parents are encouraged to volunteer 40 
hours of their time towards their student's education.  Parents may help
 
in many ways such as 

the teachers at home, and assisting in the office.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators 
and teachers.

To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including ELA 
Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Ling
uistically Relevant Teaching and Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through this program deeply align with the needs of our ind
ividual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and co
nnect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson design.
 
 
Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outside of contracted hours. In additio
n to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunity for teachers to engage
 
in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening their c
ontent knowledge, strengthening their instructional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of responsibility.
