By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Average Percentage of 8 categories evaluated: 97.84% Overall rating: GOOD
 
 
General: The District takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this
 
effort, the 
District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. Safety 
inspections take place on a quarterly basis at all sites. Below is more specific information on the condition of the s
chool 
and efforts made to ensure that students are provided with a clean, safe, and functioning learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep the school maintained and in 
working order are 
completed in a timely manner. An electronic work order process is used to ensure timely and efficient 
service. Emergency repairs have highest priority. A maintenance worker is assigned to the site, and is usually on campus 
once every week. No emergency rep
air needs exist at this site.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule: The District has standard cleaning procedures and guidelines used at each school site. 
Cleaning schedules are developed jointly between the principal and custodial staff to ensure a clean and sa
fe school. Since 

months all schools are being deep cleaned on a rotation schedule.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The vision of AESD is to
 
create an exceptional learning environment that engages, challenges, and supports all students 
so that they thrive and achieve their academic potential every year, while preparing them to pursue college and career 
opportunities to 
become competitive global citizens.
 
 
The vision for eÂ²STEAM
-
D (equitable and engaging science, 
technology, engineering, art, math and dual language immersion) education in Anaheim Elementary School District is to 
empower school communities to integrate sci
ence, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics, and Dual Language 
Immersion through the process of critical thinking, communication, creativity, and collaboration to foster innovation not 
just for today, but the future.
 
 
Core Strategy:
  
In order to incre
ase the achievement of all students and close the achievement gap, all professionals will 
build meaningful student relationships and collaborate in data
-

off track time, on
 
Saturdays and/ or through the provision of a substitute when possible. Additionally, all schools are 
provided with on site specific professional development as needed through district curriculum specialist and off site 
conference attendance.
 
 
Job embedded
 
professional learning is provided by a site instructional coach and/or facilitated 
through both peer learning opportunities. All schools have a full time instructional coach who facilitate a student centered 
coaching framework and maximize individualized 
professional learning for teachers through lesson studies, co
-
planning/teaching, PLCs, peer learning walks and provide professional learning.
 
 
Professional Learning areas of focused are identified through analysis of both formative and summative data.
 
 
All
 
unduplicated student groups ELA and Math summative data as reported by summative and interim CAASPP test items 
indicate a gap of achievement from the standard met indicator.
 
 
To meet these identified students needs the following professional learning has 
transpired:
