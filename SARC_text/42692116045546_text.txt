By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Year and 
month in which data were collected:
 
October 2019
 
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Monte Vista Elementary School are aligned to the California Content 
Standards. Instructional materials are selected from the state's most recent list of standard
s
-
based materials and adopted 
by the State Board of Education. The district follows the State Board of Education's adoption cycle for core content 
materials (English/language arts, math, science, and social science).
 
 
In the fall, the Hope Elementary Schoo
l District's Board of Trustees held a public hearing to certify the extent to which 
textbooks and instructional materials have been provided to students. The Board of Trustees adopted a Resolution which 
certifies as required by Education Code ยง60119 (1) th
at textbooks and instructional materials were provided to all 
students, including English learners, in the district to the extent that each pupil has a textbook or instructional materials
, 
or both, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient textb
ooks and instructional materials were provided to each 
student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with the cycles and 
content of the curriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science,
 
and English/language arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materia
ls 
used for their visual/performing arts curricula. Although students have music and art with speciali
sts weekly, during the 
2019
-
20 school year, Hope Elementary School District did not offer visual/performing arts classes and therefore did not 
require the distribution of respective textbooks and instructional materials.

e repairs necessary to keep the school in good condition 
are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used by school and district staff to communicate non

ast 12 months, the following 
improvements have been completed:
 

 
major gas line replacement
 

 
new heaters in some classrooms
 

 
upper playground blacktop partially replaced
 

 
roof repairs for MPR, walkways, and portables
 

 
parking lot blacktop repair and 
partial replacement
 

 
tree removal for safety concerns by office and playground

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Decisions concerning selection of staff development activities are performed by the principal and district administration 
team using tools such as teacher input, state assessment results, and data analysis to determine the areas in which 
additional teacher
 
training may enhance classroom instruction and increase student achievement levels. Monte Vista 
Elementary School supports ongoing professional growth throughout the year on minimum days. Teachers meet in grade 
level teams to conduct data analysis to iden
tify areas of need. Teaching staff are provided the opportunity to participate 
in district
-
sponsored staff development workshops or training session as 1) a supplement to site
-
based staff development, 
2) for reinforcement of or follow
-
up on previous traini
ng, or 3) follow
-
up training for newly implemented 
programs/curricula.
 
 
Monte Vista Elementary School offers support to new and veteran teachers through peer coaching and mentoring. 
Instructional aides are provided targeted training focused on teaching str
ategies and curriculum content. Substitute 
teachers are invited to participate in designated staff development activities. All staff are encouraged to attend 
professional workshops and conferences. Classified support staff receive job
-
related training from
 
department supervisors 
and district representatives.
 
 
For the 2017
-
20 year, the district also has a team of teachers engaging in MTSS staff development as part of a recent grant 
award.
