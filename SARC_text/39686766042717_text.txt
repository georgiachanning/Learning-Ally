About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

The main fact ab
out textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes for all students. 
The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is 
far more meaningful when along with 

mes of the textbooks used 
in our core classes and their dates of publication.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Imp
rovements (Most Recent Year)
 
Montezuma has 40 classrooms to support our student population. The actual amount occupied, and in use varies year to year, as
 
enrollment fluctuates. 
We also have: a multipurpose room, a library and an administration building. O
ur multipurpose room supports our breakfast and lunch program, school 
assemblies eight grade graduation and other events.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a 
timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that all classrooms, restrooms, and facilities are
 
well
-
maintained and in good 
repair. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Stockton Unified takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To as
sist in this effort, we utilize the facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California OPSC. The full report is available upon request.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca

the school facilities 
are in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. Each year a deep cleaning process occurs during a
 
close of school, either during 
the summer or other extended breaks. In the event of a facility plant emergen
cy, the principal notifies appropriate site and district personnel to resolve 
the emergency and safely secure or evacuate the students, based upon the site and district emergency preparedness plans. A si
te review with the district 
Internal Evaluation Instr
ument (IEI) occurs annually.
 
 
A comprehensive School Safety Plan, which was recently reviewed by the School Site Council, helps to provide a secure, peacef
ul and clean environment 

 
procedures to follow during emergencies and natural disasters. Emergency 
drills are conducted on a regular basis.
 
 
Every effort is made to ensure students are monitored while on campus throughout the school day. Yard supervisors, teachers, 
site administra
tors and 
school staff provide supervision for students before and during school. The playground is safe for all students. All visitors
 
must sign in at the office and 
receive proper authorization to be on campus. All visitors are required to display their p
asses at all times.
