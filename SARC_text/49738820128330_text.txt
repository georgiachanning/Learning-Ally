School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We are a Transitional Kindergarten through fifth grade multi
-
age elementary school that also houses a Special Education 
Preschool Program that includes Speech and Language Services for students thre
e years and up.  We have approximately 
220 students not including the students who come for speech only services. The mission of our school is to establish, 
expand and sustain an environment that is safe and enables every student to attain a high level of 
academic achievement 
as determined by state and national standards.  Students are empowered to become active, curious, creative, and 
effective thinkers as measured by student engagement in hands
-
on experiential and project
-
based learning opportunities. 
We 
commit to delivering a support system to assure these outcomes. We will accomplish this through a variety of learning 
opportunities and on
-
going purposeful assessments, committing resources and support to assure this outcome.  Each year 
our goal is for our
 
students to work and achieve while doing their personal best. By doing this, our goal is for more of our 
students to meet proficient levels of achievement on state and local assessments. Student academic success is supported 
through a variety of regular a
ssessments and this data is used to plan instruction targeted to all levels of student learning. 
University Elementary  supports learners through the Response to Intervention model. ELA instruction is targeted to 
students' needs using Walk to Read groups. 
Extra targeted instruction is provided with learning center supports in math 
and writing. Teachers work collaboratively to plan instruction within and across grade levels to build a cohesive 
instructional program. Teachers are supported in a variety of sta
ff development opportunities. Student and staff safety is 
a high priority. University Elementary has a public address system and phone system allowing for instant messaging and 
communication to staff and parents. New technology has been integrated into the
 
classrooms to notify teachers in the 
event of an emergency. (Messaging system that runs across the bottom of the clocks and use of radios/walkie talkies.)

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic
al education sequences or programs 
of study.

University Elementary has an activie Parent Teacher Association. (PTA) It organizes fund raising activities to provide 
resources to support special school events and additional support services. Our School Site Council monitors the progress 
of our programs
 
and participates in projects that enhance the school environment, support the instructional programs 
and gather staff and parent input regarding student progress. The ELAC committee meets to discuss general school and 
district related issues in a setting 
that fosters participation and input from the parents of our second language learners. 
There are designated periods scheduled during the year for parents to participate in conferences with the Instructional 
staff. The community is also encouraged to contac
t staff members when they have concerns or need assistance. The 
monthly newsletter provides information of interest to the University Elementary Community. Parents and other family 
members of our students provide volunteer support in the classroom, on the 
playground and on fieldtrips.  Our project 
based learning (PBL) curriculum is driven by inquiries and parents participate by co
-
teaching, gathering materials, 
coordinating guest speakers, and also acting as an authentic audience for our PBL Celebrations, w
herein students 
showcase what they learn. Volunteers sign in at the office and wear volunteer badges. We appreciate their support and 
help! They are a valuable part of our school and exemplify our strong home/school connection.

our staff continues to address school safety on an ongoing b
asis by identifying and addressing issues as they occur 
throughout the year. Finally, staff and students participate in regular practice of safety drills to better prepare themselve
