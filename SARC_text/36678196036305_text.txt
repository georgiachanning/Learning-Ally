By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

We believe 
that:
 

 
A student's social, emotional, and physical well
-
being is fundamental to their success.
 

 
An academic program should be broad, challenging, data
-
driven, and individualized to support the whole child.
 

 
Collaboration between the student, family, school, a
nd community is vital to student success.
 

 
Teachers have the ability to dramatically impact students' lives. success is defined by doing our personal best.
 
Objectives:
 

 
All students will meet or exceed the essential Common Core standards for Language Arts as
 
measured by the 
school, district, and state assessments.
 

 
All student will meet or exceed the essential Common Core standards for Mathematics as measured by the 
school, district, and state assessments.
 

 
All English Learners will demonstrate no less than one
 
level of growth annually in English language proficiency 
as measured by school, district, and state assessments.
 

 
All students will demonstrate behaviors that reflect physical, social, and emotional well being as measured by 
school and district assessments

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Lehigh prides itself with being a safe and orderly campus for all students. We maintain a Comprehensive School Site Safety 
Plan that was developed for the Ontario Montclair School District in collaboration with local agencies and the district 
office. The p
lan ensures safety of students and staff, it includes maintenance, security and safety of the physical 
environment and safe school climate, as well as our school safety compliance that ensures all required child abuse 
reporting procedures, suspension and e
xpulsion policies, due process, notification to teachers about dangerous pupils, 
sexual harassment policy, school wide dress code, procedure for safe ingress and egress from school, procedures to ensure 
a safe and orderly environment and rules and procedur
es on discipline. Monthly disaster drills are scheduled and practiced 
school wide to ensure safety procedures. The plan is frequently reviewed and updated, it was discussed with the staff in 
September 2019.
 
Date of Last Review/Update: February 20, 2019
 
 
Last Discussed with Staff: September 2019.
 
 
Lehigh Elementary's Safety Plan, reviewed on an annual basis, is an integral part of the school environment. Bi
-
monthly 
drills are held to practice safety procedures in the event of an emergency, review staff mem
ber roles and responsibilities, 
and test support systems. Elements of the plan appear regularly on staff meeting agendas, leadership team meetings, and 
parent advisory council meetings.
 
 
The goals of Lehigh Elementary's Safety Plan are to ensure that:
 
 
1.
 
All
 
students and staff members are provided a safe teaching and learning environment.
 
 
2.
 
All students are safe and secure while at school, when traveling to and from school, and when traveling to and 
from school related activities.
 
 
3.
 
District programs and commun
ity resources are made available to students and parents.
 
 
4.
 
The school provides the educational environment where students, parents, staff, and community members shall 
effectively communicate in a manner that is respectful to cultural, racial, and 
religious background.
 
 
In addition, the school has a Disaster Preparedness Plan and a Crisis Response plan to deal with specific emergencies.

Lehigh Elementary School strives for continuous improvement for both staff and students. In addition to the numerous 
and varied professional development opportunities offered by the District's Teacher's On Assignments (TOAs), Lehigh 
develops it's own profe
ssional development plan based on the site's specific needs for both the students and teachers. To 
determine instructional practices to introduce or refine for staff members, the site leadership team looks at both student 
data and anecdotal notes made duri
ng informal and formal observations. The Instructional Coach along with 
administration plan and provide professional development throughout the year with grade level teams. Teams are given 
subs to meet and discuss data, plan according to the data to respon
d to student needs and get training on best practices 
for resources and delivery of instruction practices.
 
Over the last two years the teachers have developed and are using a rubric for writing that mirrored what students would 
be scored on during the CAAS
PP administration. Staff developed R.A.C.E to remind students that their written and verbal 
responses needed to recite the question, answer the question, cite evidence, and explain how the evidence supports their 
answers. In addition to R.A.C.E for writing
, development was on best implementation strategies for Eureka math, and the 
third and final focus area was ELD QTEL strategies to support long
-
term English Language Learners in reclassification.
 
 
With RACE being Lehigh's anchor over the last two school ye
ars, data suggested that students needed to be more engaged 
in their own learning and Kagan became the focal point and next step. The principal, instructional coach and a team of 
teachers attended a two
-
day training that introduced Kagan structures and the
 
power of using these structures to keep 
students both engaged and accountable for their learning. The team of teachers went back to present the information to 
their grade level teams and began to model lessons using Kagan structures. The coaches worked wi
th teachers who were 
not officially trained but were eager to try out the structures in their classrooms. The principal met with teachers one
-
one
-
one if she felt that Kagan structures could enrich the delivery instruction in their classrooms. Each staff de
velopment 
meaning was opened with a team building or class building structure from Kagan.
 
 
2018
-
2019 continues with Kagan and RACE but the focus on Positive Behavior Intervention Systems (PBIS). As a school 
that promotes high academic achievement we believ
e teacher's delivery practices must enforce content accessibility for 
students as well as high student engagement. Hence, we ensure teachers professional development is in the area of 
content accessibility through best practices for delivery. Students are 
given repeated exposure to content with whole 
group and small group instruction. Every Tuesday is dedicated to professional development in the aforementioned areas 
of content delivery and engagement. Teachers are given the opportunity to work with an Instr
uctional Coach to improve 
their best practices.
 
 
This year, 2019
-
 
2020 has been a year to continue to focus on the programs, resources, pacing and planning that has 
proved success for Lehigh. Lehigh's score have evidence that the student performance is ste
adily increasing. Hence, we 
continue to focus on RACE, use the rubrics teachers created and facilitate student engagement through Kagan. However, 
we are more focused by introducing Learning Targets with Success Outcomes for students and teachers. This keep
s 
teachers focused on the objective of each lesson and allows students to focus on the expected outcome for evidence of 
mastery. This professional development is ongoing throughout the year and teachers are given time to demonstrate best 
practices to one a
nother as well as with the Instructional Coach.
