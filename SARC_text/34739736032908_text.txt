Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Dudley Elementary School is committed to assisting all of our students with support in the areas of academic, behavioral, 
and social
-
emotional development.
 
 
Academically, we provide support at several levels.  When a student is identified with an area of need, the teacher 
identifies accommodations and modifications to employ, writes a SMART goal related to the area of need, and meets with 
the parent of the chi
ld to relay this information.  Academic support may occur through grade level Intervention Rotation, 
in
-
class Workshop, or through small group in a pull
-
out model.  Student progress is monitored and adjustments to the 
strategy are made as needed.
 
 
Behavior
ally, Dudley Elementary utilizes Positive Behavior Intervention Support (PBIS).  We are currently in tier I  and tier 
II implementation.  The focus of the tier I  strategy is to clearly identify behavior expectations stated with positive langu
age.  
Student
s are acknowledged for displaying these expectations.  There is also a clearly defined strategy for students who 
are experiencing difficulty meeting the expectations.  Office Referral data is gathered and analyzed on a regular basis to 
identify if particul
ar expectations need to be revisited as identified.  Tier II focuses on those students who haven't 
responded to tier I level supports and additional strategies, such as Check
-
In, Check
-
Out are utilized and data is tracked as 
to the effectiveness of the str
ategy.
 
 
Dudley Elementary attempts to meet the social and emotional needs of our students by accessibility to a school counselor 
5 days per week.  We utilize Healthy Play, Second Step, and Community Circles in all classrooms as tier I intervention 
strategi
es.  We offer Toolbox as a skill development strategy as a tier II strategy.  As needed we can access support from 
the district Behavior Support Team as well as ERMHS counseling.
 
 
Dudley Elementary strives to have all of our students become college and car
eer ready, and these programs have proven 
to be quite valuable.
