School Description
 
The school's mission and vision is
 
posted in all classrooms and regularly articulated via 
presentations at Back to School Night, Parent/Student handbook and most school 
correspondences. The Ladd Lane community works together to continuously analyze evidence and 
refine school priorities acc
ording to our focused mission and vision. Utilizing our Professional 
Learning Community Framework, the leadership team, with assistance from the principal worked 
with the staff to develop this focus. In creating our mission and vision statement, staff rese
arched 
the characteristics of powerful organizations. The faculty then brainstormed and prioritized a list 
of skills that are needed for students to be high level learners. Through a partnership with parents, 
students and staff, Ladd Lane School is making 
great strides in continuously aligning our school 
priorities with our mission. We are committed to ensuring that all of our students achieve to their 
fullest potential. Especially, that the achievement gap of English Learners is significantly decreased 
via
 
the utilization of key signature practices which are aligned with our school vision.
 
 
Mission Statement:
 
Ladd Lane's mission is to provide an atmosphere where each child is encouraged to strive for 
excellence academically, socially and emotionally in a sa
fe and supportive environment.
 
 
Vision:
 
Ladd Lane embraces the importance of collaboratively providing services and supports to 
strengthen the academic and social achievements of students while preparing them to be 
productive citizens.
 
 
The community is lo
cated in the city of Hollister which sits in northern San Benito County, 47 miles 
from San Jose, 39 miles east of the Monterey Peninsula, and 90 miles south of San Francisco. The 
region retains its agricultural heritage. Ladd Lane Elementary serves approxi
mately 670 students in 
grades TK through fifth, including four special day classes that serve students with moderate to 
severe disabilities. Although we are one of the largest elementary schools in the district, Ladd Lane 
prides itself on its "family type"
 
atmosphere. Education, including an academically rigorous 
program, is highly valued by our faculty and families, along with a high degree of staff morale and 
parent satisfaction. Each year we have many more families request or transfer into our school tha
n 
we can accommodate. There is a strong commitment to excellence on the part of the entire faculty.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains informati
on about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they i
ntend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the 
CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Plann
ed Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Data reported are the determination of good repair as documented in a completed Interim Evaluation Instrument, including the 
school site inspection 
date, the Interim Evaluation Instrument completion date, and the date 
of any remedial action taken or planned.
 
 
*Facility inspection was conducted at the beginning of the year. All items requiring repair have been or are being addressed 
with any safety issue having 
the highest priority. On November 4, 2014, the voters of the
 
Hollister School District passed Measure M, a $28.5 million Facilities Bond that will address 
the most critical renovation and modernization needs at the District's elementary and middle schools. Measure M will upgrade 
fire alarm and security 
systems, imp
rove access to classroom technology, and provide better school access to people with disabilities, among other improvements.

Parents and the community are very supportive of educational programs at the school. Parents play a very active role by parti
cipating in various school 
clubs and activities including classroom volunteers, field trip c
haperones, Parent Club activities, and organizing special events. Many programs, such as 
our classroom activities and facilities are enriched by contributions made by the Parent Club. Parents also participate in th
e School Site Council which 
makes decision
s regarding the school plan, to ensure high quality instructional goals. This is an important committee at Ladd Lane School. 
Each parent 
representative of the School Site Council is elected to a two year term. These elected parent representatives gain impo
rtant knowledge about education 
in the California Public Schools. The School Site Council meets regularly. The Parent Club meets the first Wednesday of each 
month in room H1 at 9am. 
Please contact the Parent Club office at 636

School Safety Plan
 
Student and staff safety is of the utmost importanc
e. The school is in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations, including those pertaining to 
hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The school's disaster preparedness and comprehensive safety plan includes
 
steps for ensuring 
student and
 
staff safety during a disaster. Fire, earthquake drills and lock down drills are conducted regularly. A record of evacuation 
times are kept on 
a shared Google Doc. The comprehensive safety plan outlines a focus, goal, objectives and budget for the followi
ng five areas: Characteristics and 
Students and Staff, School's Physical Environment, School's Social Environment, School's Culture, and Safe School Plan. In ad
dition Ladd Lane has an 
Incident Command System Team (ICS). The ICS team has been trained and re
gularly practices communication during all emergency drills. The School Site 
Council meets regularly and addresses the programs and components that make up the school plan including the safety plan. Thi
s committee consists of 
the principal, elect staff, el
ected teachers, and elected parents. The school plan for Ladd Lane Elementary School is updated yearly, the safety plan is 
updated on a two year cycle. Protocols and evacuation maps are in each classroom office and multipurpose room. These posted p
rotocols
 
are available 
for law enforcement, district, local officials and parent review. In addition, all visitors and volunteers to the campus are 
required to sign in at the office 
and place a visitor sticker on their shirt. Supervision is provided for students t
hroughout the school day; the responsibility is shared between teachers, 
the school staff and yard supervisors.

programs: Title I 
-
 
Education for the Disadvantaged, Title II 

 
Teacher and Principal Training and Rec
ruiting, and Title III 
-
 
English Language Acquisition and 
Academic Achievement. Using general fund money in combination with categorical funding, the district provided every K 

 
5 elementary site (also the K 
-
 
6 and K 
-
 
8 sites) an Intervention Teacher and
 
a Physical Education Teacher.  The Intervention Teacher plans with teachers and provides small group 
intervention instruction. The P.E. Teacher provides the required minutes of instruction to grade level groups of students, al
lowing the teachers more 
time
 
to collaborate about instruction and/or provide intervention instruction.
 
 
Students who qualify also participate in before or after school intervention classes, provided through the Supplemental Educa
tion Services, Title I and 
site funds are used to 
have an ELD Academy before and after school. Students who qualify through Migrant Education receive additional intervention 
services.

se funds are made with the 
School Site Council, based on achievement data for the school.
