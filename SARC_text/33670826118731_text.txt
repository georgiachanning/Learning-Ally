About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about 
the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educ
ational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or t
he district office.

lability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

A District committee considers textbooks for recommendation on a cycle established by the State Board of Education and from a
 
State adopted list.  The 
committee meets to discuss curren
t issues relevant to the subject matter, including student success, previously used textbooks, and instructional 
methods.  The committee reviews demonstration copies of proposed textbooks, as well as listen to representatives describe the
 
various highlight
s of the 
available materials.  The review is followed by a pilot of materials that results in consensus by the committee of a recommen
ded textbook.  The textbook 
is forwarded to a K
-
12 Curriculum Council, which consists of teachers, parents, and community 
stakeholders, for review and approval.  If the textbook is 
approved by the K
-
12 Curriculum Council, the textbook is forwarded to the Superintendent and the Governing Board for their review and approval.
  
Each 
pupil in the district, including English learne
rs, kindergarten through grade twelve, is provided with standards
-
aligned textbooks or basic instructional 
materials that are consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framework adopted by the State Board.
 
 
AB 1246, added Education Code Sect
ion 60210, which allows the district to use any instructional materials, not just state
-
adopted, as long as they are 
aligned with the academic content standards.  The EC 60119 has a new section (e) with a reference to the Common Core State St
andards (CCSS)
.  The 

content standards, it is the 
intent of the Legislature that textbooks, instructional materials, and supplemental instruction
al materials be deemed to be aligned with the content 
standards pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (c), and be deemed consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framew
ork adopted by the state 
board pursuant to subdivision (a) if the textbooks, 
instructional materials, supplemental instructional materials, or a combination of any such materials 

ed to either the 1997 
standar
ds or the 2010 CCSS standards for mathematics and English Language Arts are compliant with Williams Act requirements.  In acc
ordance with 
Education Code Section 60422(a) and 60119, the Governing Board certified on 9/3/2019 that each pupil in the district, 
including English learners, in 
kindergarten through grade twelve, has been provided with standards
