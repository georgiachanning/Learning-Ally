By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
12/2019
 
 
The district has proactively adopted California standards
-
based curriculum as 
they have been approved by the California 
Department of Education.  When curriculum is adopted, some professional development time is spent in training staff and 
talking about ways the curriculum helps students achieve mastery of standards.  The Science cu
rriculum is the most out 
of date in terms of textbook adoption but this is due to the state not adopting the Next Generation Science Standards as 
of the publication of this document.  Teachers have supplemented the curriculum with lessons and activities ba
sed on the 
nationally
-
recognized Next Generation standards and the district created a STEAM Science Academy to provide students 
hands
-
on science experiences.  Once California adopts the standards and approves textbooks, the district will aggressively 
pursu
e ways to replaced our outdated materials.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade elev
en. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabil
ities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Arcohe is a great schoo
l because of the amount of support the district receives from families and other members of the 
community.  The Arcohe Parent Teacher Club (APTC) is a vibrant part of the school and helps organize many opportunities 
for students across the district.  Activ
ities range from fundraising at the annual Herald Day to creating unique opportunities 
for our students with the Harvest Festival, Christmas in the Barn, Walk
-
a
-
Thon and Field Day.  The group meets on the first 
Tuesday of the month at the school and is alw
ays looking for new ideas and new members.
 
 
Apart from the APTC, the district is always looking for parent involvement and input with the School Site Council and 
District English Learner Action Committee (DELAC).  These groups are subcommittees of the Boar
d of Trustees and are 
valuable in communication and support as they make recommendations to the board and review current practices.  
Parents of English Learners are also encouraged to participate in a Bilingual Parent Academy to both learn English as well 
as learn how to support their children at school.
 
 
We highly encourage parents to come to school and learn how they can be part of the educational process.  We know that 
a strong school starts with strong families.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety Plan is reviewed annually by a core group of Arcohe teachers, staff, parents, and area 
first
-
responders.  
The goal of the committee is to create an easy
-
to
-
use plan that allows flexibility in any emergency situation.  As a rural 
district, we understand our unique challenges, and, therefore, build capacity in our staff to handle the unforesee
n 
circumstances.  All staff members are trained on different disaster situations so they are as prepared as possible.  After 
the plan is reviewed and adjusted, it is presented to the Board of Trustees for formal approval.
 
 
A new key element of our plan is 
the introduction of the ALICE protocol for violent active shooter situations.  This 
nationally
-
recognized plan allows staff members choices based on current situations.  The goal is to allow students and 
staff the opportunity to barricade, fight back or es
cape in order to survive a potential attack.  For more information about 
the program, go to https://www.alicetraining.com/ or call the school.

To help support our staff, Arcohe utilizes five Professional Development days throughout the year for continued growth.  
Typically, the district will spend a few days before the school year starts to kick off 
training for the year and then continues 
to support initiatives with additional days spread out on the academic calendar.  This system allows students to have small 
breaks throughout the year and allows the staff to have check
-
in points as we meet professi
onal development goals.  In 
addition to the all
-
day in
-
service days, the district utilizes the weekly early
-
release Wednesdays for smaller professional 
development topics and school
-
level meetings.
 
 
The primary focus for professional development is 
understanding curriculum and assessment as it applies to research
-
based teaching practices.  The school has established Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) to help foster 
communication amongst staff and to focus on student mastery of standards.  An ad
ditional focus for the school is the 
social
-
emotional development of students through the creation of strong PBIS practices and allowing students the 
opportunity to grow as individuals.
 
 
To support teachers, the school has an instructional coach on staff a
nd works closely with the Sacramento County Office 
of Education to provide further support.  Grade
-
level teams also meet on a quarterly basis to review local and state 
assessments to understand current student progress and to talk about ways to help studen
ts learn.
