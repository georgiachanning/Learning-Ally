By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 

 
We are proud to be recognized as a 2017 National Blue Ribbon School for high achievement as well as a 2015 California 
Gold Ribbon School Award winner.  We were 
selected for these honors because at William Brooks School we provide a 
strong academic program, which challenges and supports student learning. We encourage students to develop leadership 
skills and responsibility, to seek lifelong learning, to cooperate 
with others, and to provide community service. Students 
are also encouraged to actively participate in school activities such as cross
-
country running, Talent Show, band, and 
student leadership, Running Club, P.A.W.S. (Positive Actions With Students), Choi
r and more. School attendance is 
promoted through regular spirit days, character development activities, and annual curriculum
-
based special events in all 
grade levels.
 
 
We are extremely proud of the educational program at William Brooks because it works w
ell for students and their 
families. Our beautiful computer lab, the latest technology in all of our classrooms (i.e. Chromebooks and Promethean 
Boards), and our math and reading interventions which include Level Literacy Intervention, and Read Naturally L
ive are 
some of what supports our solid educational program. Our teachers strive to stay up to date with strategies in their 
classrooms that engage 100% of their students.  Our staff takes pride in their ability to meet the needs of all levels of 
learners.
  
A primary reason for our success is the high degree of parent involvement and support. Many parents donate 
their time and resources each day. The Parent Teacher Association (P.T.A.) is very active in planning and carrying out 
events, enrichment activitie
s, and fund raising. P.T.A. support has supplemented the school site budget by providing funds 
for Chromebooks, classroom materials, P.E. equipment, library books, and assemblies. Parents serving on the School Site 
Council are actively involved with staff 
in reviewing curriculum and recommending improvement actions for the school 
program. Parent participation and support is a strength and asset to our school.

ve remodeling, resulting in: a new computer lab, kindergarten complex, a wing of six classrooms, 
Promethean Boards in each classroom, added kitchen and updates to the gym. While reviewing this report, please note 
that even minor discrepancies are reported 
in the facility inspection process. The items noted in the table have been 
corrected or are in the process of remediation.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessm
ents for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in t
he administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have
 
successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

William Brooks 
Elementary greatly benefits from its supportive parents who volunteer in the PTA, Garden of Learning 
Club, Art Docent Program, as well as assisting with learning centers and classroom support. Our parents also act as 
chaperones making it possible for our 4
th and 5th grade students to have overnight science field trips to Redwood Alliance 
and History field trip in Coloma.  William Brooks is involved with several community partnerships, including the local Rotary
 
who sponsors the Student of the Year award, an
d Pennies for Patients, Hands for Hope, and the El Dorado County Food 
Bank. They also may run for School Site Council every other year.

ingress/egress of pupils
 

 
fire/earthquake/lock down drills/other evacuation procedures

All 

includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a monthly 
basis throughout 
the school year. Lockdown drills are held each trimester. Students are supervised before, after school, 
during lunch and break periods, by assigned yard duty supervisors and teachers. There is a designated area for student 
drop off and pick up. Visitors mu
