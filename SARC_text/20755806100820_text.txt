School Description
 
Webster Elementary School, a 2004 and 2020 California Distinguished School, serves approximately 
650 pre
-
school through 6th
-
grade students.  Webster Elementary is 
located in a residential area 10 
miles east of the city of Madera and 10 miles northwest of the city of Fresno. The Golden Valley 
Unified School District was established in 1998 and is led by a five
-
person school board. Webster is 
one of two elementary sch
ools in the District. Webster's students feed into Ranchos Middle School 
and then into Liberty High School.
 
 
Webster Elementary is more than academics, we instill in our students the values that make 
Madera Ranchos an ideal place to live and raise children
. In 2014, The Bonner Center for Character 

Development recognized Webster Elementary for its character education program.  The 
recognition reads Webster is being recogni


the whole child.  We emphasize and reward students for displaying positive character traits in and 
outside of 
the classroom. We believe that victory without honor is no virtue. We aspire to achieve 
with character.
 
 
Mission
 
The Webster community works collaboratively to create a positive school climate. We strive to 
develop good character and focus on achieving 
personal and educational goals. We take pride in 
increasing student achievement through exemplary practices and resiliency.
 
 
Vision
 
Achievement with Character
 
 
Belief Statements
 
We believe that:
 

 
Learning is contagious in a respectful environment.
 

 
Learning 
is relevant, authentic, and appropriate.
 

 
Character development is essential to a well

Competition creates perseverance, pride, and motivation.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
dist
rict office.

Webster Elementary School is very fortunate to enjoy the benefits of concerned, involved parents who s
how strong support for the school. The Webster 
Parent Teacher Club meets monthly with a focus on providing classroom supplies and resources over and above what the District
 
supports, so there can 
be a richer academic environment. The School Site Council me
ets to advise on the School Site Comprehensive Plan. The English Language Advisory 
Committee meets to address the needs of English Language Learners at Webster. This committee looks at how state and federal f
unds are used to support 
children and the supple
mentary materials utilized to address student needs. Numerous opportunities exist for parents to get involved at the school s
ite. 
Among the opportunities are participation on the School Site Council (SSC) and the English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC)
.

School Safety 
Plan
 
Webster Elementary School has a Safe School Plan that is reviewed and updated annually. Plans are reviewed with staff annuall
y often at the beginning 
of each school year. Our WES School Site Council (SSC) approves our Safe School Plan. Emergency drill
s are conducted to prepare students and staff in 
the event of an emergency. We strive to maintain a safe, clean, respectful and orderly school campus that encourages positive
 
attitudes in students and 
staff. A joint effort between students and staff help k
eep the campus clean and litter free. Site maintenance staff surveys their campus as the first order 
of business each day. They insure the campus is clean, any vandalism is corrected, and that the campus is presentable and rep
resentative of the priority 
Go
lden Valley Unified School Board sets on safety and appearance.  Webster Elementary School's comprehensive safety plan was re
viewed and updated 
in October of 2019 by the WES faculty. The plan with any changes is approved by the Golden Valley Unified School
 
District Board of Trustees annually.

Over the last five years, the primary mode of enhancing teacher's pedagogical practice has been through weekly two
-
hour grade level collaboration and 
staff development sessions to identify and implement
 
effective teaching strategies to better meet the needs of students.  During the grade
-
level 
collaboration, our professional learning community has been hard at work on the Cycle of Inquiry (COI) using State assessment
 
and core curriculum 
Benchmark data di
s
-

evels. 
During this time, teachers and paraprofessionals discuss the performance of both individual students as well as student
-
gr
oups. Through the Cycle of 
Inquiry, the staff has been able to continually monitor student progress and reteach essential standards to ensure that all s
tudents are growing 
academically. The Learning Lab also has disseminated data to identify those students
 
who have tested out of the lab, so that other students may get 
additional support. In short, our focus has been to align our instruction to content standards, state and district assessment
s, develop units and lessons 
as a team, adhere to the Explicit Dire
ct Instruction model when delivering instruction, evaluate student learning by analyzing achievement data and 
modify the instructional plan to better meet the need of all students.
 
 
Webster teachers and administrators identified gaps between our adopted cu
rriculum and state assessments. Consequently, in the 2018
-
2019 school 
year, we focused on better aligning our ELA and math curriculum to the district and state assessments. Teachers asked for pla
nning time and guidance 
from content specialist to complete t
he work. Now that we have better alignment, for the 2019
-
2020 school year, we've begun the work to unpack the 
new state adopted science and social studies standards. At least one teacher per grade level is planning to attend the Fresno
 
County Office of Edu
cation 
Professional Learning Communities workshops series to learn about the Next Generation Science Standards and implement units o
f studies with provided 
resources. In addition, our reading lab specialist, RSP teacher, and assistant principal attended a 
two
-
day Acadience training to provide better support 
for reading intervention. Lastly, Benchmark Advanced will be providing training for all teachers twice this year to equip the
m to deliverer effective ELA 
instruction.
