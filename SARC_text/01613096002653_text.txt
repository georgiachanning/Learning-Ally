By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Lorenzo Manor has 
many parents and community members who provide direct support to our school. They are involved 
through Parent Teacher Organization  (PTO), field trip transportation and supervision, and fund
-
raising. Many parents also 
provide assistance directly to our tea
chers in the classroom. In addition, our School Site Council (SSC), composed of staff, 
parents, and community members, meets 6 times per year to provide valuable input and decision
-
making on key issues 
related to our school wide programs and the use of fun
ding for students from state and federal education programs.  Our 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), made up of parents and staff, also provides us with valuable information 

ive group of parents/guardians, and teachers, 
joining together for the purpose of providing children with a quality education. We also have monthly Family Fridays, 
where parents visit the classroom at the start of school then meet in the MPR for presentati
ons on different topics 
(academic support, safety, health, cyber safety, etc...)
 
 
Our school keeps our parents and community informed of activities through various other communications in English and 
Spanish, including a monthly parent bulletin, informatio
nal flyers and weekly reminders (by internet), a regularly updated 
web site and automated calls home through Blackboard Connect telephone messages.
 
 
We are proud of our school and encourage you to volunteer. In addition to helping in the classroom, school 
office, and 
with PTO events during the year, there are opportunities to serve on site committees such as the ELAC, and Safety 
Committee. To find out more about our school, you may pick up a copy of our Parent Bulletin, log onto our Web site, or

There is an Emergency Operations command structure in place, which is updated annually.  All staff are given specific 
assignments in 
case of an emergency (such as first aid, search and rescue, emergency student dismissal, food/shelter, and 
safety). A chart of assigned duties and a description of duties has been distributed to all staff. There is a freestanding me
tal 
storage shed housing
 
classroom sets of individual bags with a water bottle and an energy bar for each child. Also inside 
the shed are two 50
-
gallon drums of water, first aid supplies, and other emergency supplies. Furthermore, each teacher 
has an emergency backpack in his or 
her classroom with special survival supplies.  Throughout the year, the staff  and 
students participate in monthly fire drills, as well as regularly scheduled earthquake, lock down and shelter
-
in
-
place drills.
 
 
The School Safety Plan was most recently revi
ewed, updated, and submitted to School Site Council in September, 2019.
