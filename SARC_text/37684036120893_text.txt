School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced 
Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may
 
participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of 
students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Pa
rental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
California Virtual Academy @ San Diego (CAVA @ San Diego) actively seeks to involve parents in every step of their 
student's education, both through parent education opportunities and in communication and dialogue
. Parents will help 


ol. 
Parents are given an opportunity to make their voices heard (both online and offline) and provide their opinions on the 
direction of the school. Some parents will be asked to give critiques and/or testimonials about the program. Direct parental 
involve

our program and choosing to enroll their child in our school. Parents attend a registration conference and agree to the 
enrollment requiremen
ts.  By completing these steps, parents show they are committed to being an active member of 
their student's education team in our program.
 
 
Parental involvement is enhanced by the fact that the school will be educating not only students, but also its pare
nts. 
Parents will be trained on the K12 instructional system, and taught how to be effective instructional coaches under the 
guidance of highly qualified and certificated teachers. Many parents will learn how to use computers for the first time, 
become exp
ert e
-
mail and Internet users and will be exposed to a content
-
rich curriculum, including classic literature, a 
comprehensive re
-
telling of the story of history, various musical genres, and great works of art.  Parents will have a rich 
social networking ex
perience with the school Facebook site Weebly site.  We have many resources available both online 
and offline. There are ongoing Parent/Learning Coach training opportunities through K12 Speaker Series, Online School 
tutorials, School Effectively at Home wo
rkshops and staff presented Learning Coach workshops.  Elementary, Middle 
School, and High School teachers are offering Parent Education sessions.  These sessions provide support to our parents 
on understanding and working with their students in the common
 
core curriculum for mathematics and English language 
arts.  These sessions were determined by the survey results of CAVA @ San Diego parents.  High School parents have the 
opportunity to attend sessions virtually that have a wide variety of topics availab
le, including new parent support.  We 
have a very detailed Parent Student handbook, Special Education handbook and CAVA @ San Diego New Parent Resource 
Guide.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
The California Virtual Academy takes staff and student health and safety very seriously. Because the school is a virtual 
school, there will be no need for a school building where classes are held on a daily basis. The administrative office 
curre
ntly complies with all ADA, OSHA, and local health and safety requirements. The school has obtained all necessary 
permits for these offices including a building and fire marshal inspection and/or a certificate of occupancy.
 
 
Immunization forms and other pertinent medical records will be kept (confidentially) on file by the school administration. 
Parents are expected to ensure that their children obtain proper immunizations prior to matriculating pursuant to Chapter 
1 (commenci
ng with §120325) of Part 2 of Division 105 of the Health and Safety Code. The school may exempt students 
from enrolling who are not properly immunized pursuant to §48216 (a
-
c) of the Education Code. Those parents who are 
having difficulty obtaining immuniz
ations for their children will be provided information on where to get immunized in 
their community.
