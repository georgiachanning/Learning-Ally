School Description
 
Castle Park School is one of 49 schools, including charters, in the Chula Vista Elementary School 
District. CVESD is the largest TK
-
6 school district in California. The District is approximately five miles 
from the border with Mexico and serves about 29,60
0 students. Castle Park first opened its doors 
on February 18, 1952. During the 1996
-
97 school year, Castle Park School went through an 
extensive modernization process and was modernized again during the 2014
-
15 school year. The 
school is located in an old
er, established community of mostly single
-
family residences in Chula 
Vista. The socio
-
economic status of Castle Park's student body is reflected in the fact that the school 
qualifies for all students to receive free meals. Castle Park has a diverse racial
-
ethnic mix, which 
exposes students to the diverse cultures living in our school community. Many students attend 
Castle Park on zone transfers from other schools and communities.
 
 
Mission
 
At Castle Park, we believe each person in the school is an individua
l of great worth. It is our goal to 
treat each child, staff member, parent, and community volunteer with respect and to demonstrate 
appreciation for their efforts to make positive contributions to the learning environment of the 
school. We are committed to
 
helping each student develop socially and academically to reach his 
or her greatest potential. We will accomplish this by offering a sequential curriculum and 
instructional strategies aimed at allowing for continuous progress for all students. We believe 
that 
ongoing home
-
school communication and a program of student, staff, and volunteer recognition 
and appreciation will result in the development of a positive sense of self
-
esteem for everyone at 
the school and lead to a positive and safe learning environ
ment.

About the SAR
C
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Con
trol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to addre
ss 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information abo
ut the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of

We encourage parents to visit and become active in our school.  Parents and members of the communi
ty may become members of the School Site 
Council (SSC), Site Advisory Committee (SAC), the English Language Acquisition Committee (ELAC), Parent Teacher Association (
PTA), and the Gifted and 
Talented (GATE) District Committee.
 
 
We believe that parents shou
ld share in the decision
-
making and governance of the school. Therefore input from the various parent groups is solicited 
when making important decisions affecting programs, schedules, and activities throughout the school year.
 
 
Increasing the level of par
ent involvement in our school continues to be a major goal at Castle Park School.  During the 2019
-
2020 school year, many 
hours of volunteer time were spent assisting our teachers and staff towards academic success for our students.  We have noted
 
an incre
ase in the number 
of parents volunteering and participating in school activities.  Students love to see their parents helping in classrooms.  P
arents are encouraged to visit 
their student's classroom regularly. If you would like to get involved at Castle P
ark School, please call (619) 422
-
5301. Office staff will assist with the 
fulfillment of volunteering requirements.
 
 
During the 2019
-
2020 school year, Castle Park Elementary will continue to provide opportunities to parents to actively participate in train
ing and 
workshops to help students master academic grade
-
level standards, and achieve academic success.  Volunteer training will be offered by Castle Park 
Elementary staff.  A parent involvement committee has been established to determine how parents can b
ecome involved in their student's education 
and offer a support system for the on
-
going transition to the new computer
-
based programs and curriculum.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Student safety and well
-
being is promoted by activities, including emergency and earthquake preparedness, shelter in place, 
lock
-
down drills, and bus 
evacuation drills, enhanced playground supervision, drug, and alcohol abuse prevention education programs, child abuse awaren
ess, and School Safety 
Patrol.  All students will be supervised during recess time by staff.  Any volunte
ers need to have an updated and cleared Tuberculosis test.  If volunteering 
more than one day per week, a fingerprint background check is required.  The school is enclosed and remains locked while stud
ents are in session, and 
this includes during periods o
f extended day and YMCA programs.  Any visitor must present a state or federal form of identification, which will be scanned 
into our new RAPTOR visitor management system. This system checks for any criminal record involving children, serving as a de
terren
t as well as a 
prevention measure by identifying adults who should not be around children.  Once cleared, visitors receive a sticker badge. 
 
District employees and 
Promise Neighborhood personnel are required to wear employee badges at all times.  Emergency
 
maps are available at the office upon request.  
Emergency Procedures and Safety Plan are available for review at the main office and community members and school personnel h
ave access through 
the school's employee shared drive or website.  A climate commi
ttee has been established to dialogue and implement systems to keep students safe.  
The plan was approved by the SSC in September 2019.
