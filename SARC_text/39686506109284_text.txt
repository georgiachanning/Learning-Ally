talents
 
of

the
 
needs
 
and
 
abilities
 
of
 
all

Our
 
success

Parent
 
/Faculty
 
Club,
 
School
 
Site
 
Council,
 
English
 
Learners
 
Advisory
 
Committee
 
(ELAC),
 
and
 
various
 
classroom
 
and
 
school
 
activities.
 
Student
 
Competence
 
in
 
basic
 
skills
 
is
 
determined
 
by
 
student
 
progress
 
and
 
performance
 
on
 
daily
 
work,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
formative
 
and
 
statewide
 
assessments.
 
Our
 
school
 
works
 
to
 
build
 
skills
 
of
 
social
 
responsibility,
 
valuing
 
high
 
standards
 
of
 
personal
 
health
 
and
 
hygiene,
 
leadership
 
skills
 
to
 
participate
 
in
 
a
 
democracy,
 
career
 
readiness,
 
economic
 
principles
 
and
 
a
 
work
 
ethic
 
to
 
participate
 
in
 
a
 
capitalistic
 
system.
 
Self-
discipline,
 
self-direction
 
and
 
appreciation
 
for
 
cause
 
and
 
effect
 
relationships
 
are
 
foundational
 
concepts
 
at
 
Colony
 
Oak
 
School.

of
 
Colony
 
Oak
 
Elementary

our
 
youth
 
for
 
their
 
future.
 
We
 
build
 
on
 
a
 
positive
 
school
 
culture
 
by
 
fostering
 
collegiality
 
and
 
involving
 
all
 
our
 
stake-holders.
 
We
 
promote
 
student
 
excellence
 
through
 
effort,
 
encouragement,
 
and
 
high
 
expectations.
 
We
 
enhance
 
student
 
learning
 
through
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
technology.
 
We
 
challenge
 
our
 
students
 
with
 
inquiry-based
 
learning
  
that
 
is
 
both
 
rigorous
 
and
 
engaging.
 
We
 
establish
 
strong
 
foundational
 
skills,
 
as
 
we
 
integrate
 
a
 
broad
 
exposure
 
to
 
the
 
fields
 
of
 
science,
 
technology,
 
engineering

Parents
 
are
 
important

for
 
the
 
learning

You
 
are
 
the
 
first
 
and
 
most
 
important
 
teacher
 
your

will
 
ever
 
have!
 
It
 
is
 
a
 
tremendous
 
responsibility,
 
but
 
as
 
a
 
team
 
working
 
together,
 
we
