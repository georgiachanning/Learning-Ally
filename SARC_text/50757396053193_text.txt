School Description
 
The Mission statement for Wakefield Elementary is "We encourage respect and responsibility 
through 
compassion and acceptance in a safe learning environment."
 
 
Wakefield Elementary School is the oldest elementary school in Turlock Unified School District. We 
proudly serve an average of 600 students in our regular TK
-
6th grade program. In addition, we hav
e 
five pre
-
formal Autism classes, a TK
-
third grade dual immersion program and serve both Head Start 
and State Preschool.
 
 
Wakefield honors students monthly for character and academic achievement.  We have a character 
block built in to our daily schedule so
 
that teachers may teach character lessons in every classroom. 
Our teachers reinforce monthly character traits and explicitly teach character lessons through role 
play, use of digital media and literacy.
 
 
Teachers meet weekly during PLC 
collaboration to discuss student learning. Strategic supports and 
strategic enrichment is planned. Our Intervention Team works closely with grade level teachers to 
ensure that we have an academic plan for each student. Teachers offer tutoring outside the s
chool 
day for individualized and accelerated support. These classes are planned and approved by 
administration with students selected according to state and local assessments.
 
 
At Wakefield, we take great pride in celebrating student achievements including
 
daily 
announcements, Trimester Awards, Honor Roll Awards, Student of the Month, Character Trait of 
the Month and Perfect Attendance. Opportunities for student leadership and extracurricular 
activities include:  baile folklorico, student council, orchestra
, band, choir, art, chess and our After 
School Education and Safety Program (ASES).
 
 
Our goals for the current year:
 
 
We will increase the number of 3rd 

 
6th grade students who met or exceeded in ELA proficiency 
from 22% to 35% (adding 36 identified stude
nts) as measured by the CAASPP by May 2020.
 
 
We will increase the number of 3rd  

 
6th  grade students who met or exceeded in math proficiency 
from 11% to 25% (adding 40 identified students)
 
as measured by the CAASPP by May 2020.
 
 
All students will demonst
rate one year's growth in reading as measured by the SEL, EDL2 and Next 
Step Reading Assessment by May 2020.
 
 
We will increase the number of EL students who attain the proficiency level of Bridging from 33% 
to 47% (adding 40 identified students) as measure
d by the ELPAC
 
 
We will decrease the overall number of students with chronic absences from 7.7% to 6%
 
(reducing 10 identified students with chronic absences) by May 2020.
 
 
We will reduce the number of suspensions from 41 to 30 (decreasing by 11 students) b

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which de
scribes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information a
bout SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions 
and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
An assessment was done in August 2019 using the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT), Wakefield Elementary is currently a Williams 
School; as such this 
inspection was completed by SCOE representative John Cicinato. The
 
school buildings and grounds of Wakefield Elementary have been deemed to be 

 
or staff. Copies of the District 
Safety Inspections a
nd Williams Inspections are maintained on file in the Turlock Unified School District Maintenance and Operations office. Safe

time Lead Custodian who provides students and staff with a clean 
and safe school environment throughout the day. Our district additi
onally employs two full time night custodians who are responsible for cleaning all 
facilities on a daily basis. All state and district guidelines governing the custodian tasks have been implemented and are fo
llowed in accordance with all 
applicable laws. I
mprovements: Wakefield Elementary was modernized in 2013 and received several improvements including new restrooms and a new 
fire alarm system. In the fall of 2017 a new Kindergarten facility was constructed which opened in January just after Christm

new student and staff restrooms as well as a new playground.  Adequacy: The Turlock Unified School District prides itself in 
offering clean, safe and 
adequate school facilities. Our buildings offer adequate heat and air and are m
aintained in accordance with stringent state and district guidelines. FIT 
Results: The FIT form dated August 8, 2019 may list some items found during the site inspection. These items should not be co

Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education populat
ion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
alig
ned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that 
satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 20

-

Parents have many opportunities to be involved and supported while at Wakefield Elementary. We have the following advisory gr
oups; English Learner 
Advisory Council (ELAC) and School Site Council (SSC) that meet every other month to discuss the vario
us functions of the school. Our ELAC advises our 
SSC to help them make informed decisions regarding our budget, school site plan, safety of our campus, incentives for student
s and many other items 
that are discussed and approved at SSC. All of our represen
tatives for ELAC and SSC are voted on by our parents or guardians.
 
Parents have opportunities for support as well. We offer the opportunity to participate in literacy and academic content area
 
parent workshops.  We 
also offer English language support, comp
uter classes and hold various parent nights throughout the year.  In primary classrooms, parents volunteer to 
support students in reading, writing and supporting work in rotational centers. Parents become stronger partners in the educa
tional process by att
ending 
literacy functions that help them understand expectations for success.
 
 
In order to better communicate with parents regarding essential student learning and expectations that focus on academic, phy
sical and mental needs, 
parents have the opportunity
 
to attend several parent nights throughout the year.  Additionally, we provide a parent compact, a monthly newsletter and 
post parent information on our website, Instagram and Facebook page. For more information, please contact the school office a
