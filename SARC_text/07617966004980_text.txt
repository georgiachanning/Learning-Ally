School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to e
nsure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school uses 
the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good 
repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The school personnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleanin
g schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic
al education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priori
ty: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
In addition to classroom 
volunteering, parents support our students in several critical areas: a multicultural committee 
organizes community events for the Dual Language program; a safety committee supports student arrival/dismissal in the 
parking lot; a PTA committee runs an afte
r
-
school student store with healthy snacks; and, volunteers greet students at the 
gate and run a Quiet Recess room.
 
 
Parents also serve informal roles on the School Site Council (SSC), in the PTA, and as part of the site's African
-
American 
Parent Advisory 
Group. The role of the SSC is to give parents, teachers and staff more on
-
site decision
-
making ability by 
giving individuals the opportunity to work together in planning school program improvements. Stewart School has a School 
Site Council composed of five
 
parents or community members, the principal, three classroom teachers, and one other 
staff member (Education Code Section 52852). This council reviews progress, the effectiveness of what we are doing in 
our Single Site Plan and then determines the best us
e of any budgetary funds that come under their domain. The PTA 
organizes evening social events for students and their families and conducts fundraisers to provide financial support for 
the positive incentives students earn for responsible behavior.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of the School Site Safety Plan is to provide a unified template for school sites to respond and recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the disruption of normal school operations.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan guides a coord
inated school staff response to an emergency, disaster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over ti
me and those that may occur without warning.

Teachers commit to over 25 hours of collaboration during the school year in addition to at least 12 hours of personal 
professional development. Staff collaboration time allows
 
teachers to deepen their practices in core subject areas, plan 
rigorous lessons, and analyze student achievement and behavioral data to design effective supports and interventions. In 
addition to classroom instruction, teachers serve on the site Instructi
onal Leadership Team, Safety Committee, 
Multicultural Committee, and Positive Behavior Interventions and Support committee. Select staff take on other 
leadership roles, including Technology lead, Visual and Performing Arts lead, Teachers' College Reading/W
riting Workshop 
Lead, Elementary math lead, Middle School math lead, and Student Leadership advisor.
