of
 
each
 
year,
 
every
 
school
 
in
 
California
 
is
 
required
 
by
 
state
 
law
 
to
 
publish
 
a
 
School
 
Accountability
 
Report
 
Card
 
(SARC).
 
The
 
SARC
 
contains
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
condition
 
and
 
performance
 
of
 
each
 
California
 
public
 
school.
 
Under
 
the

Formula
 
(LCFF)
 
all

(LEAs)
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
prepare
 
a
 
Local
 
Control
 
and
 
Accountability
 
Plan
 
(LCAP),
 
which
 
describes
 
how
 
they
 
intend
 
to
 
meet
 
annual
 
school-specific
 
goals
 
for
 
all
 
pupils,
 
with
 
specific
 
activities
 
to
 
address
 
state
 
and
 
local
 
priorities.
 
Additionally,

Principal™s
 
Message
 
 
Orcutt
 
Junior
 
High
 
School
 
is
 
located
 
in
 
the
 
northern
 
region
 
of
 
Santa
 
Maria
 
and
 
serves
 
students
 
in
 
grades
 
seven
 
through
 
eight
 
following
 
a
 
traditional
 
calendar.
 
At
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
the
 
2019-2020
 
school
 
year,
 
526
 
students
 
were
 
enrolled,
 
including
 
13%
 
in
 
special
 
education,
 
15%
 
qualifying
 
for
 
English
 
Language
 
Learner
 
support,
 
and
 
35%
 
qualifying
 
for
 
free
 
or
 
reduced
 
price
 
lunch.
 
 
The
 
culture
 
of
 
Orcutt
 
Junior
 
High
 
School
 
reflects
 
a
 
commitment
 
that
 
all
 
students
 
can
 
learn
 
and
 
encourages
 
all
 
students
 
to
 
be
 
academically
 
successful.
  
Our
 
classes
 
are
 
heterogeneously
 
grouped
 
and
 
raising
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
student
 
achievement
 
defines
 
our
 
most
 
important
 
effort.
  
In
 
each
 
academic
 
department,
 
students
 
know
 
what
 
the
 
state
 
mandated
 
content
 
standards
 
are
 
because
 
they
 
are
 
posted
 
in
 
the
 
classroom,
 
listed
 
in
 
their
 
textbooks
 
or
 
kept
 
in
 
their
 
notebooks.
  
Under-performing
 
students
 
are
 
identified
 
early
 
in
 
the
 
school
 
year
 
and
 
interventions
 
like
 
reading,
 
or
 
math
 
support
 
classes
 
are
 
established.
  
In
 
other
 
academic
 
areas,
 
our
 
LCFF
 
Supplemental
  
funds
 
have
 
been
 
used
 
extensively
 
to
 
provide
 
resource
 
materials
 
and
 
conference
 
opportunities
 
for
 
teachers
 
to
 
meet
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
their
 
students.
 
 
Of
 
the
 
25
 
full
 
time
 
certificated
 
teachers
 
on
 
campus,
 
four
 
work
 
with
 
resource,
 
or
 
special
 
education
 
students.
  
All
 
teachers
 
on
 
campus
 
open
 
their
 
classrooms
 
before
 
school,
 
after
 
school
 
and
 
at
 
lunch
 
to
 
assist
 
all
 
students.
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
statewide
 
testing,
 
students
 
at
 
OJHS
 
are
 
assessed
 
through
 
NWEA
 
three
 
times
 
per
 
year.
  
Students
 
are
 
given
 
assessments
 
in
 
language,
 
reading
 
and
 
mathematics.
  
NWEA
 
assessment
 
data
 
gives
 
vital
 
information
 
to
 
teachers
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
facilitate
 
increased
 
student
 
learning.
 
 
Orcutt
 
Junior

both,
