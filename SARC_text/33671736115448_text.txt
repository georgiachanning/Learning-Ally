School Description
 
Two Bunch Palms Elementary School is located in Desert Hot Springs, a community located within 
Riverside County, California. Two Bunch Palms Elementary is part of the Palm Springs Unified School 
District, which is comprised of sixteen elementary schools, f
ive middle schools, one alternative 
education academy, four comprehensive high schools, and a continuation high school. Two Bunch 
Palms opened in August of 1998. The enrollment is approximately  800 students spanning 
transitional kindergarten through grade
 
five.
 
 
It is the mission of Two Bunch Palms Elementary School that every member of the community 
shows respect for self, others, and the learning environment. It is the shared commitment of the 
staff, parents and students of Two Bunch Palms Elementary to 
provide an atmosphere of loving 
acceptance and mutual respect which meets the diverse needs of our school population. We will 
support each other in maintaining the climate of high expectations necessary for student 
achievement.  Our entire school community
 
strives for all children to realize their maximum 
academic and social potential by providing activities that promote not only critical thinking and 
decision
-
making skills, but also a life
-
long love of learning. Efforts to increase student achievement 
incl
ude implementing an effective Response to Intervention plan including research based 
programs. Within this plan student assessment data is frequently analyzed. Planning and pacing 
support student learning. Additional teacher professional development opport
unities are provided.  
Two Bunch Palms Elementary School evaluates the effectiveness of our School Plan for Student 
Achievement (SPSA) following the release of annual state and federal assessment scores each year. 
Our School Site Council (SSC), English Lea
rner Advisory Committee (ELAC) and other leadership 
groups have the opportunity to review all student achievement data. Revisions to our SPSA, and 
subsequent School Board approval, will occur if there are substantial budget and/or material 
changes during t
he school year.

Abou
t the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the 
Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities
 
to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Every student is given a set of textbooks to use at scho
ol.  All textbooks are consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum frameworks, adopted 
by the SBE.  Every student including English Learners has access to their own textbooks and instructional materials.  An incl
usive adoption process was 
used
 
during each text adoption period. Each EL student has access to ELD instruction through the reading program adoption and is s
upported with 
instructional strategies and systems within all subject areas. Teacher, district personnel, and parents are involved
 
in a textbook selection process. This 
includes analyzing each offering by criteria that supports special needs, ELL students, and interventions for students below 
grade level. Textbooks in poor 
repair are replaced per district protocols.

School Safety Plan
 
This plan was updated in December 2019 by the site Safety Committee and reviewed with faculty in January 2020.
 
 
Every student and teacher has the right to attend a school free from physical and psychological harm. To help schools achieve
 
these vital goals, the State 
of California has mandated that each K
-
12 school develop a school safety plan. Reviewed annually, a s
chool's safety plan is the result of a systematic 
planning process in cooperation with local law enforcement agencies, community leaders, parents, pupils, teachers, administra
tors, and other persons 
interested in the prevention of campus crime and violence
.
 
 
Goal #1: Continue to develop and implement a  school
-
wide positive behavioral management system (PBIS) and anti
-
bullying program that will promote 
character building and a safe environment that encourages and reinforces positive behavior that will allow
 
students to be productive citizens.
 
 
Objective #1
-
1 TBP will continue to distribute and monitor Jackrabbit points for students demonstrating positive behavior above and beyond
 
classroom 
expectations.
 
 
Objective #1
-
2: The implementation of a school wide sy
stem will allow the TBP community to share common rules and procedures that will encourage 
positive behaviors and the reinforcement of those behaviors.  This will include the rules for using the new playground equipm
ent and games on the 
playground.
 
 
Object
ive #1
-
3:  Two Bunch Palms will teach lessons on social values and continue weekly anti
-
bullying lessons via the Second Step program.
 
 
Goal #2: Re
-
evaluate and update the safety and emergency procedures for the playgrounds, solar field and the pick
-
up area
.
 
 
Objective #2
-
1:The Safety Committee will design rules and expectations for games, behavior and safety for the playground equipment and are
as.
 
 
Objective #2
-
2: The Safety Committee and Administration will evaluate the area surrounding the solar field and
 
adjust any safety protocols (emergency, 
ingress and egress of students, etc.) as necessary.
 
 
Objective #2
-
3:The Safety Committee and Administration will evaluate the student drop
-
off and pick up area and adjust any safety protocols, supervision 
and proced
ures as necessary.
 
 
At Two Bunch Palms Elementary administrators and/or the administrative designee are available to assist with severe or persis
tent student behavior 
problems. Students should first see the teacher as the person in control of the class. Th
is control is established through modeling and by requiring 
accountability for classroom rules and procedures. All teachers are required to have a written and posted discipline plan. Th
e plan must be sent home 
with children during the first week of school 
and must have a tear
-
off to be signed and returned. The discipline plan must be sent home with all students 
new to a class. The discipline plan should include four to six classroom rules, a list of fair and enforceable consequences, 
the last of which is a 
referral to 
the principal or assistant principal. The plan should also include a list of rewards for positive reinforcement of outstandin
g behavior. It is the expectation 
that all discipline and behavior plans promote a positive climate within each classro
om. The administrators will use a progressive discipline matrix with 
students referred to the office.

Each year we have designed professional learning based on student achievement data, research of best practices and discussion
s with teachers and 
principals. The specific 
approaches vary by content area. For ELA, in 2017
-
18, the focus was on aligning instruction to Smarter Balanced Assessments, 
depth of knowledge, and deeper understanding of the Reading Targets in Claim 1. In 2018
-
19 the focus was on the gradual release mod
el, and 2019
-
20 
was an extension of the previous two years, as well as an addition of training around Claim 2 (Writing).  The professional de
velopment in these areas was 
provided by the Schoolhouse Project. In 2018
-
19 the teachers began working with High I
mpact Math consultants. This professional development centers 

 
1 (2018
-
19) the focus was 
on developing strategies to support number
 
sense by implementing mental math routines and highlight the landscape of learning in mathematics. During 
Year 2 (2019
-
20) the focus is on strengthening mental math routines, identifying the math goal of a lesson, and planning for and implement
ing a three
-
part lesson (Launch, Explore, Summarize). This professional development also supports teachers with the implementation of the
 
district
-
adopted math 
program (Bridges in Mathematics and Number Corner).
 
The numbers in the chart above represent 12 days of ELA
 
training in 2017
-
18. For 2018
-
19 there are 6 full days for ELA. For the 2019
-
20 school year there 
are 8 days for ELA and the remaining number of days in 2018
-
19 and 2019
-
20 are full days of professional learning for math.
