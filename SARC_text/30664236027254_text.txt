By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Benito Juarez
 
Elementary School
 
was founded in 1965. It was named after the famous Mexican revolutionary and 

 
 
Benito Juarez 
Elementary School is a team oriented learning community where staff, students, and parents work 
together to provide a safe and accepting learning environment that focuses on acquiring 
 
future ready skills; while at the 
same time fostering an appreciation f
or the diversity that exists in today's global society.
 
 
Students at Juarez are provided with real
-
life learning experiences focused on STEAM education and the development of 
Global Competencies. Daily teaching and learning is centered on providing student
s with a balanced education that 
includes a focus on access and achievement of common core language arts standards, mathematical standards, NGSS 
standards, coding and digital 
 
literacy, music, arts, and engineering projects. Additionally, Juarez School pre
pares 
students for world citizenship by providing ongoing opportunities to acquire an in depth knowledge and understanding 
of international issues, an appreciation of and the ability to learn and work with people from diverse linguistic and 
cultural backgr
ounds.
 
 
To ensure the success of our students we:
 
     
 

-
free environment for all students
 
     
 

 
     
 

tration, students and parents to establish S.M.A.R.T.goals for student achievement
 
 
     

 
     
 

-
based teaching practices
 
 
     
 

unity
 
     
 

 
 
 
 
The vision of Benito Juarez School is shared responsibility for student achievement. The school community has 
approved the Juarez 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) which outlines the plan to r
aise the academic 
performance of all students. Based on an analysis of student data and program components, school goals and objectives 
have been identified. These goals specify student groups and grade levels; in addition, a means of evaluating the 
progre
ss towards each goal is established. Significant elements required in the plan are scientifically based teaching 
strategies, professional development,extended learning, and parent involvement.
 
 
 
In addition to the regular core curriculum, our English langu
age learners are given English Language Development (ELD) 
based upon their ELPAC scores with the goal of English proficiency for all students. Students are grouped in all grades 
based on their level of English fluency with language instruction being given 
at their appropriate instructional level.

As a result of the ongoing process of data analysis, teachers identify students who are working below grade level and in 
need of additional assistance. This data is presented by the classroom teacher to the si

Parents and staff meet to discuss the academic and/or behavioral needs of each student referred. Appropriate 

e 
frequently referred to the Learning Lodge for additional intervention. This literacy intervention program is taught by a 
Teacher on Special Assignment (TOSA) during the regular instructional day for students in grades K
-
6. Math intervention 
is also provi
ded to at
-
risk students based on need and as funding allows. The Resource Specialist Program serves 
students in grades Kinder 
-
 
6th with specific learning disabilities whose Individual Education Plans require placement in a 
special education program. Stude
nts attending this program spend most of their day in a regular education classroom. 
The time and type of support is dependent on the individual needs of each student.
 
 
 
 
As funding permits, additional intervention programs are provided for all students K
-
6 after school.
 
 
Juarez school provides Gifted And Talented Education (GATE) within a GATE cluster classroom in both English 
Mainstream classrooms and our Dual Language Immersion classrooms. Students are placed in a GATE program based on 
district's criteri
a for GATE placement. All GATE identified students are provided with differentiated instruction to meet 
the goals of their individual GATE plan.
 
 
 
Juarez school proud to provide an outstanding Dual Language Immersion program. The program opened its doors d
uring 
the 2010
-

population from TK through 6th grade. The goal of this program is to develop academic proficiency and literacy in two 
languages, Spani
sh and English, while cultivating an understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures. Students in this 
program receive standards based instruction in both languages with the goal of receiving the Pathway to Biliteracy 
Award. This pathway is the first st
ep toward achieving their Seal of Biliteracy when they graduate from high school.
 
 
Benito Juarez is proud to have the Anaheim Achieves program on site. This program serves students Monday through 
Friday from dismissal until 6:00 p.m. It is funded through a
 
grant in a collaborative partnership between the Anaheim 
Elementary School District, the City of Anaheim, and the YMCA. Students are able to receive help with their homework 
and participate in various extra curricular activities while building character d
evelopment.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The 
percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Most recent review date: 11/19/2019
 
 
Each year Juarez School reviews and updates its comprehensive School Plan. This plan is revised annually and reviewed 
by the School Site Council and the School Safety Committee. Public input is solicited for the revision of the School Safety 
Plan. The plan
 
consists of two main components that address three elements. The first component, People and Programs, 
discusses strategies and programs that aim to improve the learning environment to ensure a caring and connected school 
climate. This includes affiliatio
n and bonding, where those who enter the school feel a sense of belonging and respect. 
The second component, Physical Environment, addresses the physical safety of all students and staff members. 
Procedures and routines for maintaining an orderly and safe 
environment are discussed within this component.
 
 
 
The School Safety Plan is a public document and is readily available for inspection at the school site and at the district 
office.
