By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

ld at a Time
 
 
Our Mission:
 
 
We believe students will be challenged in an atmosphere of rigor, stamina, and high academic expectations that produce 
exceptional results
 
 
Our Behavioral Statement of Purpose:
 
 
We believe in a culture where being responsible, r

members and parents are regularly involved in our school, volunteering their services to teachers and children. Our school 
is a joint venture between Capistrano Unified School District and the Orange County Department of Education. We share 
our scho

commitment to meet the needs of all children.
 
 
The instructional staff at Reilly is dedicated and dynamic. They regularly collaborate to 
provide best practices for student 
success. They attend a wide range of staff development throughout the year to continually update and improve their 
professional skills. Reilly has a working partnership with local universities to help develop strong stude
nt teachers while 
also providing a lower student/teacher ratio within the participating classrooms.
 
 
Our staff at Reilly provide a comprehensive, balanced program which promotes high scholastic achievement for all 
students. Emphasis is placed on student

ce
ntered learning activities which allow students to apply skills in language arts, 
social science, science, and mathematics to real life scenarios. Our outstanding staff and students use a variety of 
technological resources as tools to increase student lear
ning throughout all areas of the curriculum. We deliver a strong 
academic program focusing on curriculum which is closely aligned with the Common Core State Standards. We 
consistently monitor our instructional programs to produce positive learning outcomes

Reilly takes pride in our high academic standards. We offer enrichment activities for high achieving students. Students 
having difficulty meeting grade level standards may be served through classroom and grade level interventions or 
Specialize
d Academic Instruction (SAI)  services provided by special education staff members. We differentiate instruction 
to meet the individual needs of each and every student at our school.
 
 
While academic focus is a top priority, our PTA and staff members are co
mmitted to the maintenance of a well
-
rounded 
program, including participation in field trips, assemblies, Art Masters, Music, Patriot Pals, and our Character Education 
program. Students in grades kindergarten through fifth grade all have Chromebooks in the
ir classrooms as educational 
tools. We offer several extra
-
curricular activities, including Student Council and After
-
School activities.
 
 
The YMCA offers before and after school child care as well as a Kindergarten Plus program. Additional after school chi

At Reilly Elementary we believe that education is a collaborative process and a community responsibility. A team spirit 
between staff, students, parents and the comm
unity is evident. Each Wednesday that sense of community is displayed at 

Build Relationships and Work Hard!" Building a positive school cl
imate is the key to our school connectedness. Together, 
we ensure that the children attending our school engage in meaningful activities that will support learning for a lifetime.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Reilly Elementary School has 38 
classrooms, a multipurpose room, library, and an administration building. The main 
campus was built in 1990. Portable classrooms were added in 1993 to accommodate class size reduction and an additional 
portable was added in 2003 to accommodate our growing 
California Children Services (CCS) program.
 
 
The district maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair are completed in a 
timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure services and emergency repairs are giv
en high priority. The 
custodial staff has developed a cleaning schedule to ensure a clean school.
 
 
Renovation was completed on the library, administrative buildings and lunch patio area.  New carpeting was put in 
throughout the library and administrative b
uilding in July, 2013.  The roof on the administration building was also replaced 
in July, 2013.  The patio cover over the lunch tables outside the school cafeteria was repaired with new wood and new 
fittings where needed.  Ramps on the F Building were rem
oved and replaced in July, 2014. New rain gutters were installed 
in December, 2014 to support the new roof on the administrative building.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievem
ent level percentages are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

Capistrano Unified School District places great value on the role of 
professional learning, and utilizes systems
-
wide 
structures and strategies to promote continuous learning of adults that result in increased learning for students.  The 
ongoing focus for professional learning is to support the district's Wildly Important G
oal for Teaching and Learning.  It is 
the district goal to engage students in meaningful, challenging, and innovative educational experiences to increase post
-
secondary options for all students.
 
 
It is the goal of  Capistrano Unified School District to ens
ure all students receive Great First Instruction (GFI).  The vision 
for GFI is that all learning environments include Lesson Preparation, Interaction, Strategies, and Review and Assessment 
as defined by the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP)
.  By design, the model for providing professional 
learning is multi
-
tiered, and ranges from large
-
scale, district
-
wide learning opportunities focused on priority areas to site
-
specific, embedded professional learning (including coaching) that supports tea
chers in the transfer of that learning to the 

school hours to further support district initiatives and teacher needs for ongoing professiona
l learning. The outcome of all 
CUSD professional learning is to improve educator effectiveness in order to increase student learning. In support of this 
outcome, administrators participate in professional learning to increase their knowledge of quality pra
ctices, California 
Content Standards, and strategies for instructional leadership.
 
 
Since 2004, all schools provide specific release time for embedded professional learning using late start or early release 
days.  In grades K
-
8, this time is known as ACE t
ime (Articulation and Collaboration for Excellence).  The purpose of this 
time is for educators to examine the impact of their practice on student learning, with a focus on continuous improvement.  
Schools work to identify key areas of learning based on an
 
analysis of student data, upon which they place their focus for 
professional learning and set annual measurable goals based upon those identified areas of need. These areas are 
determined through the analysis of student learning data from multiple sources
, including, but not limited to high stakes 
testing. The action plan developed to accomplish these goals outlines priorities for teacher training and implementation.

Throughout the year, the structure of collaboration typically involves teacher teams enga
ging in ongoing examination of 
standards
-
based curriculum, the examination of meaningful formative and summative assessment data, and powerful 
teaching strategies that get results in student learning. In 2017 the District developed the CUSD Professional Le
arning 

Goals, Relational Trust, Focus on Learning, Shared Responsibility, Action
-
Oriented, Data Driven, and Systems and 
Structures for Su
pport  to ensure all students are learning at high levels.  These embedded professional learning activities 
help prepare teams to provide a differentiated instructional program that meets the needs of all students.
 
 
Beginning teachers receive systematic tr
aining and support during their first two years of teaching within the CUSD 
Induction Program. This program assists new teachers as they build upon the skills they already possess upon entering the 
field of teaching, and provides them with support from a v
eteran teacher. The program is approved by the California State 

to those activities previously described, all teachers may receive support
, assistance, and opportunities to grow 
professionally through their participation in school site learning teams, student study teams, from district resource 
teachers, and the Peer Assistance and Review Program.
