-
going school assessments, including integrated, formative and summative assessments to monitor 
progress in math and ELA 
 
 
Parents are consistently involved in many aspects of our community including in and out of the 
classroom educational support, yard duty assistants, parent/grandparent volunteers and almost 
100% participation during Teacher
-
Parent Conference week. In additi
on, our PTA is active 
throughout the school year raising supplemental monies to support our field trips, school wide 
assemblies, Art in Action Program and educational software programs. Carnivals, information 
nights, math events, and numerous other positiv
e and thoughtful activities enhance our 
community.
 
 
Response to Intervention (RtI) and Student Study Team (SST) meetings are held on a tri
-
monthly 
basis. All students at Ponderosa ES are supported to ensure academic and socio
-
emotional success. 
Students ne
eding additional academic and social support are monitored at Student Study Team 
(SST) Meeting(s). The principal, teachers, special education teachers, academic support teacher, 
speech pathologist and parent(s) work collaboratively to see how we can best m
eet all the 
academic needs of students needing additional support. When students are needing additional 
support interventions from Tiers 1
-
3 are implemented. Immediate intervention plans are 
developed with specific objective(s), person/people responsible t
o ensure progress is being made, 
data collection and student work samples are gathered to assess growth and development. Tier I 
modifications and accommodations are made. Additional Tier II interventions are added as needed. 
Our 180 funds are specifically 
targeted for CCSS Intervention and Support.

About the SARC
 
By F
ebruary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control F
unding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
sta
te and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.
