Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priorit
y: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):

Ca
lifornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alter
nate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements fo
r entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our Comprehensive School 
Safety Plan (CSSP), modeled on the Incident Command System, addresses all components of 
SB187 including biannual Crime Reports, Student Discipline, Sexual Harassment, Dealing with Dangerous Pupils, Crises 
Response Plan, Dress Code, and Alternative Programs
. The CSSP is reviewed annually by Staff and shared with parents via 
Parent University.  Emergency equipment has been supplied for each classroom and for the school as a whole.  Evacuation 
drills are held monthly.  Teachers have been trained in "Run, Hide,
 
Fight" scenarios by the Napa Police Department.  All 
staff members have been trained in annual Mandated Reporter training.  During the first weeks of school, teachers and 
the principal explain policies about student safety, playground, rules, classroom be
havior, bullying, and harassment.  
Discipline follows the NVUSD "Standards for Student Behavior".

With the support from district and SH Cowell 
Foundation funding, teachers meet twice a week in their grade level 
Professional Learning Communities; the model is based exclusively on the DuFour model. Teachers use essential standards 
and data from formative assessments in the areas of English Language
 
Arts and Math to write SMART goals.  They design 
instruction using best practices that include AVID and Project GLAD strategies.
