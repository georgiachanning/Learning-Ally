By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg

.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Lake Forest Elementary School, with the strong support and involvement of our parents and community, is committed to 
providing all students with the skills they need to become successful learners. Our staff is dedicated to providing
 
a 
standards
-
based program, which emphasizes achievement, both academic and social, at the highest levels of excellence 
to meet the unique needs of our students. At Lake Forest, we as a staff and community truly believe that our "future is 
limitless" as we
 
nurture and challenge our students to fulfill their potential now and in the coming years.
 
 
We will provide our students with a broad range of educational experiences and skills needed to become adaptable, 
flexible thinkers, who are proud of themselves an
d their accomplishments, who take responsibility for their actions, and 
who are ready to contribute to our school and community. By offering multiple opportunities in several curricular areas, 
students are exposed to many exciting experiences that can insp
ire them to look beyond the basic materials and discover 
their personal strengths.
 
 
Lake Forest Elementary was founded in 1990 as a starter school with six classrooms and 130 students.  The campus 
overlooks views of the surrounding hills and attractive nei
ghborhoods, which have grown with the enrollment of the 
school over the past two decades. At one point in the late 90's our enrollment grew to 35 classes and nearly 840 students. 
In 2003
-
2004, Lake Forest Elementary School changed to a traditional calendar
 
after being on a multi
-
track year round 
calendar for nine years.  Currently, Lake Forest Elementary is a Transitional K
-
5 school serving approximately 447 students 
with 20 classrooms with a Learning Center to support students with Special Education needs 
run by a resource teacher. 
The district located two SDC classrooms on the Lake Forest campus in 2019.
 
 
Student successes at Lake Forest have resulted in state and national recognition. In 2012, our school's Academic 
Performance Index (API) score was 937. T
his achievement was the highest score in Rescue Union School District history, 
ranked in the top 10 for all elementary schools in the Sacramento region and was the highest recorded in El Dorado Hills. 
In 2004 and 2014, our school was chosen for the Califor
nia Distinguished School Award as one of the top achieving 
elementary schools in the state. This trend continued in 2013 and 2014, with academic scores consistently ranking among 
the highest achieving schools in El Dorado County.  Initial scores from the S
BAC testing from the spring of 2015 indicated 
continued success. The overall percentage of students scoring at grade level standard or higher was 73% in ELA and 69% 
in math. Both of these percentages were among the highest in the region found in elementary
 
schools. Our results from 
SBAC testing conducted in the spring of 2016 showed continued success and improvement. Lake Forest students achieved 
an 83% ELA met or exceeded score and a 74% in math. Both scores were among the very highest in the region. In Ma
y 
2018, ELA and Math SBAC scores were 69% and 64% respectively, but overall Lake Forest remained in the high achieving 
schools in the region. In 2019, Lake Forest students continued to achieve at a high level on SBAC assessments. Overall, 
children in grade
s 3
-
5 scored proficient at a rate of 77% in ELA (an improvement of 7%) and 69% in math (growth of 5% 
over 2018).
 
 
Lake Forest Elementary School prides itself on its positive school climate and its commitment to ensuring success for all 
students.  All teach
ers are credentialed and have high expectations for every student.  The curriculum is challenging and 
encompasses varied teaching and learning approaches. Our staff collaborates regularly to discuss student success, 
planning, intervention strategies for st
ruggling learners and to improve overall practice.

Currently, Lake Forest teachers
 

through reviews of on
-
going research, and collaborative discussions to better identify students who need sensitive 
interventions to encourage academic success and to be
tter develop an encouraging, caring  atmosphere in the classroom 
for the benefit of all students. A school counselor works directly with staff and families to create groups and administer 
age
-
appropriate lessons. In addition to services provided by our cou
nselor, we also support Social and Emotion Learning 
through our I SWIM program, which promotes positive traits and offers opportunities for students to participate in school 
and community service.
 
 
Rescue Union School District strictly adheres to the 
state curricular frameworks and content standards. California 
Standards are taught in math and language arts in all grades.  The core curriculum is enhanced through special learning 
activities such as our Science Prep Class, an hour and a half weekly progr
am dedicated solely to Science instruction for 4th 
and 5th grade students; outdoor education; life lab garden science; drama, art and health, dramatic and musical 
productions by guest artists and student performers; and participation in events such as Natu
re Bowl, Festival of Oral 

Zoo, Challenger Space Camp, The Roseville Maidu Center, and various theater productions.  Additionally, learni
ng 
opportunities are brought to the campus through the support of the fundraising efforts of our Parent Teacher Council.  
Activities include beginning dance, classroom music instruction, visual and performing arts assemblies, living history 
presentations s
uch as Pioneer Day and America Days, guest speakers in areas of health and fitness, visiting authors, and 
other curriculum
-
based presentations within the classroom setting.
 
 
A high value is placed on the family, and parental involvement is welcomed and enc
ouraged.  Many parents volunteer in 
classrooms on a regular basis and others support the school in a variety of ways.  The Lake Forest School Site Council (SSC) 
and Parent Teacher Council (PTC) are two organizations that encourage family input and involvem
ent.  The SSC is 
comprised of school staff and parents who work to develop a 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement to enhance the 
educational program.  The PTC organizes parent and community volunteers, plans family
-
oriented socials, and facilitates 
school f
undraisers to support and enhance the instructional programs. The Lake Forest PTC has been instrumental in 
purchasing new technology, learning programs, supporting the arts, and providing intervention for struggling students.
 
 
The curriculum focus is based
 
on California Standards. Standards are taught at every grade level, and ongoing staff 
development in Language Arts, Writing, etc. supports dynamic, data
-
driven classroom  instruction.  Current district 
adopted curriculum includes Benchmark Advance for Lan
guage Arts instruction, Houghton Mifflin GoMath program, and 
Step up to Writing. Rescue Union School District is currently piloting two new Social Studies series, and a new curriculum 
that is aligned to state standards will be adopted in 2019
-
2020 school y
ear.
 
 
Next Generation Science Standards are taught using Stem Scopes and Mystery Science.  All instruction is aligned to current 
standards, and more district adopted programs will be added in 2020. Students participate in science
-
related field trips 
and va
rious outreach programs through the American River Conservancy, The Sacramento Zoo,  the Discovery Museum, 
and other sources.
 
 
All students, from second to fifth grade have one
-
to
-
one access to Chromebooks in their classrooms.  Kindergarten and 
first
-
grade
 
students use Ipads in small groups when needed. Additionally, a fully equipped technology lab with thirty 
computer stations is  available to all students.  Chromebook use is integrated into Math, Reading, Writing, Social Studies, 
and Science lessons on a 
daily basis and students also receive instruction at every grade level to meet CA state technology 
standards.
 
 
The 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement will continue to support and enhance student achievement as directed by the 
Rescue Union School District 
Local Control and Accountability Plan. Lake Forest Elementary School is a great place for 
students to learn, and our goal is to become even better. Welcome!

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent 
Year)
 
 
School buildings and grounds at Lake Forest School provide a clean, positive environment that is conducive to teaching, 
instruction, and learning. Staff and student restrooms are clean and well maintained. Floors, wall, roof, and plumbing are 
maintained on a regular schedule.
 
 
In recent years, we have made improvements to the site through the efforts of the school, district and connections to the 
community. We have resurfaced the blacktop on the playground and the parking lot and also repainted
 
lines accordingly. 
Wood signs have been refinished and the fifth grade class and Parent Teacher Council have donated a new school sign for 
the west entrance with a bench for students. Landscaping improvements at various locations have also been completed 
in recent months by district personnel, church organizations, community outreach, PTC and Scout troops. These include 
repairs to our garden boxes and irrigation, bark replacements in multiple areas of the school, and long term garden plans 
are made possibl
e through our Landscaping Committee (connected with PTC). Business partnerships with Mercy Folsom 
Hospital and Intel in addition to coordinating educational efforts with the American River Conservancy have greatly 
increased our success in school beautifica
tion. This coordination of resources has many in the Lake Forest excited about 
our future plans for improving both our scenery and our health and environment education programs. All of these projects 

g environment beautiful.

A high value is placed on families at Lake Forest School and parent involvement is strongly advocated. Many parents 
volunteer in classrooms on a very regular basis, and parent input is welcome and sought out in 
all areas. The Lake Forest 
School Site Council (SSC) and Parent Teacher Council (PTC) are two organizations that encourage community input and 
involvement. The PTC organizes parent and community volunteers, plans family oriented social functions, and organ
izes 
fundraisers. The PTC Scrip Program purchases enrichment supplies and equipment for the Technology Center as well as 
technology in classrooms, and funds science education materials. The SSC helps develop a 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement and works 
with the school staff, PTC, and community to set yearly goals and objectives in reading/language 
arts, math/science and health, wellness, citizenship, visual and performing arts, and fitness. Technology improvements, 
art docent programs and visual and perf
orming arts activities/assemblies are offered annually to our students and 
supported through the fundraising efforts of the PTC and our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
A positive school climate is the goal of each staff member at Lake Forest School. It is our belief that the best things will 
happen for children as we endeavor to help them make good judgments and choices. We look for the good in all children 
and try to he
lp them discover their own self
-
worth. A positive discipline program is in place, and students are regularly 
recognized for their contributions to the positive school climate. The learning environment component reviews discipline 
procedures on an annual ba
sis. The suspension and expulsion rates over the past five years have been very low when 
compared to district and state averages.

The school climate has been discussed by both staff and parents through our Safe and Civil Schools Team, which examines 
schoo
l issues such as safety, procedures, yard supervision and self esteem improvement methods. We will continue our 

in order to define 
a behavior standard, improve school spirit, and develop positive peer pressure. In addition, the school 
has added social programs which support students who have playground issues, and the adults who help them on campus. 
Our student leadership team assists
 
in mediating minor playground problems and modeling caring and productive 
attitudes. They also perform skits and lessons on character traits throughout the year and illustrate to all the Laker Way. 
These expectations provide a good example for all student
s to follow and give the Leadership team a sense of 
responsibility and contribution their school.
 
 
Our School Safety Plan is updated yearly and includes goals and objectives for improving the physical environment and 
the school climate. This includes promo
ting our Character Counts program, anti
-
bullying lessons and assemblies, 
encouraging student participation in community service activities, creating a safe, nurturing environment, and celebrating 
our increasing cultural diversity. Students contribute to th
e community through service learning projects, which extend 

school special education staff (teacher and psychologist) have conducted les
sons in social development in order to 
increase "emotional intelligence" on the playground. In 2017, Lake Forest added a school counselor to assist at risk 
students in dealing with playground and other social issues. The counselor runs groups and provides 
classroom social 
lessons three days a week.
 
 
Student recognition is an important part of honoring our students. Our district
-
wide Character Counts program promotes 
positive character traits such as respect, caring, responsibility, trustworthiness, fairness
, and good citizenship. Teachers 
emphasize each character trait on a monthly basis, discuss concepts and share lessons that explore the positive aspects 
that relate to student life. Lake Forest, though work with PBIS (Positive Behavior Interventions and Su
pports) has 
developed a program titled "I SWIM". This is an acronym for Inclusiveness, Safety, Work Hard, Integrity and Mindfulness, 
that is the foundation for all school rules and expectations. As an extension of this program, we have developed a 
leadersh
ip group for 4th and 5th graders named the I SWIM team, which models good behavior and participates in school 
and community service through many groups (Garden/Beautification, Safety, School Leadership, Library Support and 
Community Outreach). Academic ach
ievement is recognized through our school Honor Roll program. Fourth and fifth 
grade students receive certificates of recognition for earning a grade point average of 3.5 (B+) or above. In 2017, Lake 
Forest added a reading incentive program through the sch
ool library. Students track their words read throughout the year 
and receive certificates and other recognition for their dedication to reading. In the first year of this program, three 
students had already surpassed 4,000,000 words read!
 
 
We have a fully equipped library, full
-
sized gymnasium with indoor and outdoor stages, and an office with a staff lounge 
and workroom. In addition, we have a learning center, reading room, a technology center, Chrome book carts in all classes 
2nd
-

-
1st), a meeting room, and science room.  We currently have 2 custodians and district utility 
technicians working diligently to keep the school in excellent condition.
 
 

e conducted with students and staff, and an 
emergency preparedness plan is in effect. Campus supervision is provided according to policies established by the District 
Board of Trustees. All efforts to ensure building safety, cleanliness, and adequacy have 
been successful. Students in fifth 
grade serve as Safety Patrol Officers. They assist in keeping the campus safe before and after school.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
All Rescue schools receive equal allocations, per student, of LCFF Base Funding.  This funding helps support students by 
providing instructional materials, supplies and other 
needs.  Funding for support services, such as maintenance of buildings 
and grounds, utilities, and student transportation, is budgeted for at the district level and provided to each school site 
based on the varying needs of the individual school.
 
 
In addit
ion to the Base Funding described above, schools in the Rescue Union School District receive Supplemental funding 
roughly proportional to the number of unduplicated pupils (English Learners, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged, and 
Foster/Homeless Youth) they 
serve.  Furthermore, school sites receive allocations from other state and federal categorical 
programs, including Title I and Title II.  The purpose of these categorical programs range from improving the quality of the 
total instructional program for all 
students to addressing the unique needs of special groups of students.

related to instructional practices, curriculum, technology, Common Core State Standards, and other educationally related 
matters are provided for all teachers.
 
 
Teachers receive professional development and will work collaboratively on a regular, ongoing basis to target key 
standards, analyze formative assessment data and develop effective instructional practices.
 
 
Five minimum days for parent conferences are al
so on the calendar in November and three days for report card 
preparation are scheduled at the end of each trimester.
