Principal's Message
 
Monroe enjoys a rich history of academic and cultural 
excellence that is the result of a collegial partnership 
between the school staff, parents and community partnerships who provide a diversity of experiences for the 
students.
 
 
Monroe's administration, parents, teachers and support staff work as a partnersh
ip to promote a mutual 
respect between home and school, to respect and appreciate the diverse groups and cultures. Monroe School 
communication is vital between parents and school,  we implement outreach strategies to provide 
information, educate and suppor
t parents. Monroe continues to build a strong collaboration and partnerships 
with parents and families of the students we teach.
 
 
Our school is a K
-
8 school with full
-
day kindergarten and Head Start Preschool classes. Monroe strives to 
become a high
-
perfor
ming school, our goal is to provide an academically rigorous learning environment with 
mastery of the Common Core grade level standards in reading, writing, and mathematics which forms the 
foundation of the instructional program for all of our students. Mo
nroe continues to strive for the one to one 
ratio with our touch screen computers. We continue to maximize our instructional minutes through targeted 
instruction and implementation of research
-
based instructional strategies. Monroe Teachers continue to gro
w 
professionally as they attend on
-
going Professional Learning Community trainings, work in Teacher 
collaborative Action Team (CAT) to discuss effective teaching practices, A
-
Z training in math and reading, 
district staff development and receive in class s
upport from the Assistant Principal and Principal. Teachers use 
Common Formative assessments, benchmark tests and the Bader Assessment which are given to students 
throughout the year to monitor their academic progress. Teacher CAT (Collaborative Action Tea
ms) meeting 
and RTI (Response To Intervention)Team use data to academically group students and drive instruction to 
meet the needs of our Monroe students. The Administrator, staff and Monroe's MTSS (Multi

tiered Systems 
of Student Support) Team provide a s
afe and orderly campus where your student may focus his/her energy 
on learning.  All students have the opportunity to meet their maximum potential with the guidance and 

urrently certified in 
both AVID Elementary and Secondary. We prescribe to the AVID mission statement that says to support 
student learning and close the achievement gap by preparing all students for college and career readiness to 
be successful in a global
 
society.
 
 
Monroe looks forward to working with you to create new opportunities and new accomplishments for our 
students this year.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes fo
r all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California cont
ent standards calls for. This information is far more meaningful when along with 

mes of the textbooks used 
in our core classes and 
their dates of publication.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

facility plant emergency, the principal notifies appropriate site and district personnel to resolve the emergency and safel
y secure or evacuate the 
students, based upon the site and district emergency preparedness plans. A site review with the district Internal Evaluation 
Instrument (IEI) occurs 
annually.
 
 
A comprehensive School Safety Plan, which was reviewed on 5/13/17 by th
e School Site Council, helps to provide a secure, peaceful and clean 

ies and natural disasters. 
Emergency drills are conducted on a
 
regular basis.

site administrators and 
school staff provide supervision for students before and during school. The playground is 
safe for all students. All visitors must sign in at the office and 
receive proper authorization to be on campus, and must display their passes at all times.
