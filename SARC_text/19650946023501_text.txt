By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

Monte Vista is proud to provide our parents and guardians with multiple opportunities for parental involvement. We 
encourage parents to become more involved at Monte Vista by participating in school
-

tend Family Nights, to join our PTA organization, attend NEU rallies, participate in School Site

workshops, also known as Parents Achieving With Stu
dents (PAWS) workshops, are key to parent and school partnership. 
A variety of topics are presented throughout the year that assists parents/families in supporting their children's social
-
emotional and educational goals. Parents and guardians are surveyed 
annually for "topics" of interest, and our workshops 
are designed to support identified areas of need. Monte Vista has a strong commitment to involving parents and 
community in a variety of ways which include volunteering in one of our site organizations, 
committees or volunteering 
in their child's classroom. Monthly information is sent home highlighting the various school
-
wide and classroom events.  
PAWS (Parents Achieving With Students) workshops and other informational meetings are held to provide parent
s, 
guardians, and community members information and training in effective methodology and strategies to better support 
academic success.  Meetings are held at a variety of times to accommodate schedules.  A monthly school newsletter, The 
Monte Vista Times 
(produced by our very own student council students), flyers, School Messenger, the marquee, and 
letters are utilized to share information with families. Spanish translation is provided for all written and oral 
communications. Monte Vista's website is updat
ed periodically so that our community is provided with current 
information and resources.  We highly encourage volunteers in the classroom, at school activities, mentoring, and to assist 
us with fundraising activities.  Our PTA encourages parent and family
 
guests to support special events such as Dr. 
Seuss/Read Across America, College Week, Honorary Service Award, Book Fairs, Family Nights, and NEU rallies.
 
 
Our district office and school coordinate additional family resources to support the unique needs of
 
individual families 
and students. A Special Education Parent Liaison is available at our school site to assist parents with information related 
to special education. Our site Foster and Homeless Youth coordinator provides individual intake meetings to sup
port foster 
and homeless students and coordinate valuable resources to ensure school success. Additionally, our district's unique
