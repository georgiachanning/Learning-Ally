School Description
 
Curren School is a K
-
8 school which serves approximately 1040 students and offers a number of 
academic programs including AVID, Dual Language Immersion, Structured English Immersion, 
Designated and Integrated ELD, Autism Program, Robotics, and other extra
-
curricular activities and 
clubs. The strand focus of Curren School is Enriching Youth via Environmental Studies (EYES) which 
incorporates the social, political, and scientific aspects of caring for each other and our world.
 
 
Curren Mission and 
Vision: The vision of Curren School is to empower all students not just to know, 
but to become. As described within our Vision and Mission Statement, Curren School is committed 
to providing the best educational program possible for our students. Our vision
 
of empowering all 
students not just to know, but to become is our daily challenge. We want students to become 
mathematicians, not just know Math. Our vision focuses on students obtaining everything for 
themselves. Owning their own learning is an important
 
quality and emphasis within our mission 
statement. Empowering students to exercise their growing autonomy, discover opportunities for 
carving their own versions of success, and ensure they become responsible members of our global 
society allows us to focu
s on differentiation and the whole child.
 
 
Our focus for this year will continue to be: Common Core Standards, 21st century skills, use of 
technology, differentiated instruction; social, emotional and behavior support; and community 
engagement. We will con
centrate on clear sets of math skills and concepts aimed to solve real
-

plan is to be dynamic and intentional with instruction and build professional learning c
ommunities 
(PLCs) to support this endeavor. Offering a rigorous academic curriculum taught using data driven 
instructional practices will require collaboration and practice. While academic excellence is our 
focus, we also encourage and teach character educ
ation, as well as leadership.  Curren parents and 
teachers embody the meaning of community. We are a dedicated, hardworking, and committed 
group who work together to support every student to grow academically and reach his/her 
potential.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, ever
y school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all lo
cal educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Add
itionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https
://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians a
nd 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
In order for students to achieve their fullest potential, we know that parental involvement is a critical factor to ensure st
udents' educational success. Our 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), Parent Teacher A
ssociation (PTA), and School Site Council (SSC), in coordination with our Outreach 
Coordinator, offer and encourage parents to become active participants in their children's education by participating in the 
meaningful and productive 
opportunities offered.
 
Curren enjoys an active Parent Teacher Association (PTA). The PTA works with the community through various school fundraisers
, 
activities, and field trips to support our students in the classroom. Our ELAC meets regularly to discuss the needs of our En
gli
sh Learners as well as provide 
support and suggestions from the community. Parents can both volunteer and attend multiple school events, including: Back to 
School Night, Math and 
Literacy Nights, along with monthly Coffee with the Principal meetings. These
 
events further support and foster meaningful and productive parental 

-
emotional growth. The school's Parent Involvement Policy provides clear guidelines for 
parents to serve as volunteers in
 
classroom and school activities. Parents volunteer their time in multiple ways including Math and Literacy Nights, parent 
education nights, coaching Robotics and sports Teams, as well as helping in the classroom.
 
 
Parents may contact Principal Tyler Higa

School Safety Plan
 
To safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, a comprehensive School Site Safety Plan has been developed by the School Safety Committee, which
 
inclu
des input from our School Resource Officer and Fire Department. The Safety Plan is updated in the fall; all revisions and upd
ates are reviewed with 
the staff and community members, including School Site Council. The School Site Council will review and appr
ove the plan in December. The plan is 
presented to the Board of Education in February for board approval. Key elements of the safety plan focus on three components
: 1) Positive School 
Climate, which is based on Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support
s (PBIS), 2) The school's Safe Physical Environment which includes school and 
playground supervision, and 3) Disaster Preparedness which focuses on disaster drills and emergency procedures.
 
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Curren S

times. Supervision is provided to ensure the safety of each student before school, during breaks, at lunch, and after school.
 
Supervision is a responsibility 
shar
ed among playground aides, teachers and the site administrators.  Additionally, Curren School uses the CHAMPs model and has a
 
developed and 
articulated School
-
wide Positive Behavior Support Plan. Implementing a successful behavior management system that es
tablishes a vision for the 
students, specifies expectations, and focuses on success helps Curren achieve our academic goals as well as create a safe and
 
civil school.
 
 
The school complies with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. S
afety drills, including fire, 
earthquake and intruder drills, are held monthly. OPD and Curren School conduct an annual Level 1 Loc
k Down Drill to prepare for an intruder on campus 
and verify that all systems and protocols are in place.
