By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report
 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountabilit
y Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF o
r LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
p
rincipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

down. Since 2011, upgrades have been made to the exterior of the campus and include a 
grant
-
funded garden and seating area, a fenced
-
gate that allows the campus to be locked down when needed, new 
cement tables for student use, and ongoing technology upgrad
es.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Calif
ornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternat
e achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for e
ntrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Par

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Fortuna Middle School we believe 

encourage parents/guardians to contact the teacher immediately by email or phone when they are unsure of assignments, 
have questions, or need to share concerns. The school w
ebsite, teacher webpages, Facebook page, marquee, and Black 
Board Connect system are all utilized to keep parents/guardians informed.
 
 
All grades are online in Aeries and parents are given a "parent portal login" where they can access their child's grades,
 
behavior, and attendance. Progress reports are sent home at least once a month and require a parent/guardian signature. 
Mid
-
trimester report cards are sent home once a trimester, and also available online. Trimester report cards are mailed 
home to parents
 
each trimester.
 
 
Parents are invited to attend numerous activities on our campus including Music Concerts, Trimester Awards Nights, Art 
and Literacy Night, FMS Athletics, Open House, and Back to School Night. Parents are also encourage to join the Fortuna
 
Elementary Parent Teacher Organization which meets monthly. In addition, monthly School Site Council, English Learner 
Advisory Committee Meetings, and LCAP Stakeholder meetings are held. A translator is available at these meetings and 
all documents and ag
endas are available in English and Spanish.
 
 
Parents/Guardians/Community members are encouraged to participate in LCAP Stakeholder Meetings and provide input 
during School Site Council Meetings. Parents of 8th grade students are encouraged to join the "8th
