By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Roseland Creek Elementary is a beautiful elementary school loca
ted in southwest Santa Rosa. We are the newest of three 
elementary schools in our district and serve students from transitional kindergarten through sixth grade. A large 
percentage of our students are second
-
language learners, and students, parents and sta
ff are very proud to be here! As 
with all schools in our district, we participate in the Accelerated Schools Plus Project. This school governance system 
encourages collaboration between students, parents, staff and community members and allows us to work t
ogether to 
make systemic schoolwide improvements as needed. Students, families and staff share a sense of community, 
empowerment and leadership. We believe all of our students are gifted and talented, and we relentlessly strive to 
challenge and support the
m to reach their highest potential. We also strongly believe in continuing to learn and grow as 
professional educators through ongoing professional development. We provide the foundation that our students and 
families need to prepare for success through co
llege.
 
 
Embarking on a JOURNEY to higher education!
