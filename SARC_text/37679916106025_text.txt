By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
 
The District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the Di
strict 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of
 
California Office of Public School Construction. This survey was 
completed on 05/01/2019 and is available at the Facilities, Maintenance and Operations office.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensu
re that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Facilities Description
 
This school has 25 permanent classrooms and 1 portable classroom, a library, a multipurpose room, a computer lab, and 
an administration building.
 
The main campus was built in 1986 and modernized in 2003. The library and computer lab 

 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to 
keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The school is cleaned ever
y other night by a cleaning crew. Work performed includes: sweeping, vacuuming, and mopping 
floors, emptying trash, cleaning sinks, filling dispensers, and dusting rooms, as scheduled. Grounds are maintained by 
District groundskeeping staff. There is one f
ull
-
time day custodian. This day custodian is responsible for daily restroom 
cleaning, cleaning eating and food preparation areas, daily grounds clean up, minor facility repairs, and special emergency 
clean ups. Carpets are shampooed and tile flooring is c
leaned and refinished every winter, spring, and summer break. A 
thorough deep cleaning of all areas is done every summer. District administration works daily with custodial and grounds 
supervisors to ensure a clean, safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budge
t
 
The District allocates funds for completion of deferred maintenance projects which consist of major repair or replacement 
of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, i
nterior or exterior paint, and floor systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

scores.

Each year, teachers and support staff participate in Professional Development, as indicated in the Comprehensive School 
Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA), the Local Education Agency Plan and Local Control 
Accountability Plan (LCAP). 
Priorities for professional development are established for teacher and staff training using student achievement data, 
teacher needs assessment surveys, and observations of instruction. In response to these priorities, sessions 
are developed 
to support classroom implementation. Teachers requiring additional certifications to meet student needs are enrolled in 
appropriate programs.
 

 
Certificated and support staff participate in workshops offered within the District (in person and o
nline), offered 
by the San Diego County Office of Education, local universities or outside vendors as appropriate.
 

 
An online professional development calendar which includes Cajon Valley Union School District offerings for 
the year is accessible to all sta
ff. Certificated staff who attend workshops during the year are frequently called 
upon to present relevant information and teaching techniques during site and district professional 
development sessions.
 

 
Professional Development is available for certificate
d personnel as well as classified staff members who work 
with students. Site categorical fund expenditures must be approved by the School Site Council.
