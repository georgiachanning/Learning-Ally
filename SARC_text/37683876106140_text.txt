About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca

School Safety Plan
 
Student safety and campus security during the school day are of primary importance. Perimeter gates are kept locked during th
e school day, and all 
visitors must sign
-

. Surveillance cameras, which are not actively 
monitored, are installed in each engress and egress area. Teachers, instructional aides, and administrators provide supervisi
on before and after school, 
during lunch and during recess periods. Development of t
he Comprehensive Safe School Plan is a collaborative effort between school and district to 
comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The plan provides students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly lea
rning environment.
 
 
Each school includes
 
the following requirements of SB 187 within their safe school plans: current status of school crime; child abuse reporting pr
ocedures; 
disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsion; notification to teachers; sexu
al harassment policy; provision 
of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and school employees including tactical information; safe and or
derly school 
environment; school rules and procedures; hate crimes polices and procedur
es; and bully prevention polices and procedures. The school evaluates the 
plan annually and updates it as needed. The plan was last updated and reviewed with school staff in Fall 2019.
