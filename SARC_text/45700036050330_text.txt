By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

 
The Grant Elementary School District
 
is a one
-
site school district located five miles southeast of Redding in the community 
of Centerville. The school district serves approximately 90 preschool students and 635 TK
-
8 students. The Grant 
Elementary School District is committed to building an i
ntegrated learning community based upon the principles of dignity, 
competence, and individual achievement.  We prepare students for the future.  The District's core values are guided by 
the support for constant improvement in student achievement and opport
unities with a shared responsibility by the 
District personnel and the Grant School Community, providing a safe, secure and well maintained campus, ensuring the 

l stakeholders equitably, 

 
 
The Grant Elementary School District has a long history of excellence and commitment to meeting the needs of all 
students.  Grant School students consistently perform well across all academic subjects and across all grade levels.  The 
District is committed to working with all stakeholders including staff, parents, students, and local community members to 
provide the 
best TK
-
8 school experience for our students.  The long history of success is a direct result of the partnership 
and involvement of the entire school community to help each student be successful and to create a school environment 
that the entire community 
can feel proud of.
 
 
The Centerville area is highly regarded as a desirable place to live. Many professional families choose to reside within the 

red 
and the high academic performance of students attending Grant also attracts students from outside of the attendance 

 
 
The goals for the Grant School District includ
e:
 
 
Safety: We create and maintain learning environments where students, staff, and parents feel welcome and safe.
 
Student Achievement: We ensure that all students will be either at or above grade level or making adequate progress 
towards being at grade le
vel in reading, writing, math, and technology proficiency and all students will demonstrate at 
least one year of academic growth annually in each of these subjects.
 
Staff Development: We empower all personnel to develop expertise and competency in their ar
eas of responsibility in 
order to provide a safe and welcome learning where our students will have the opportunity to acquire the skills that they 
will need for success in high school, college, and career.
 
Community Engagement: We partner with all stakehol
ders to develop and promote opportunities for all students and 
their families to engage in meaningful experiences at Grant School; we provide rigorous and relevant academic and social 
opportunities for all students.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The school was built in 1958. In the 2004
-

portable 
buildings. With the passage of the November 2003 State Facilities Bond Act, the District received State funding; 
combined with the passage of a local bond to construct a middle school on its current site, that added a 10,000
-
square 
foot gymnasium with blea
chers and wood floor, a visual/performing arts stage, a VAPA classroom, a library, computer lab 
and five classrooms.  The middle school has been open since the 2004
-
05 school year.
 
 
The school grounds also include tennis courts, soccer, baseball and softba
ll fields, which were paid for in part by generous 
donations from the community. An additional project with new construction of 8 classrooms and modernization of 4 other 
classrooms and the Main Office was completed during the summer of 2012.  Most recent i
mprovements to the campus 
include providing storage cabinetry in several classrooms, roof repair/replacement to several classrooms and the Main 
Office, HVAC replacement for the kitchen, overhauling the middle school Computer Lab to relocate the upper grade
 
RSP 
classroom to better serve older students, and remodeling of the Learning Lab classroom space to increase capacity.
 
 
The district continues to make strides with classroom technology.  Five years ago the wifi network was expanded 
throughout the campus. 
 
There are new computers and projectors/TVs in all classrooms.  Some classrooms use 
Promethean Board technology to display and present instruction.  The Promethean Board technology allows them to 
interact with the screen during instruction.  Other staff me
mbers use the Microsoft Surface to interact with content that 
is presented to students.  The district has invested heavily in Chromebook technology and are close to 1
-
1 across all grades.  
There are a total of 24 mobile carts of chromebooks to increase stu
dent access to technology in the classroom.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education populati
on and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the re
quirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The district seeks every opportunity to involve parents in the development of the Local Control Accountability Plan.  
Parents have the opportunity to attend parent conferences, open forums, Board Meetings, and School Site 
Council 
meetings.  These meetings are designed to solicit input from parents and other stakeholders regarding district concerns, 
opportunities, and funding priorities.  Proposed actions and services are shared with stakeholders to develop an effective 
plan
 
for achieving the long
-
term goals of the district.
 
 
Grant Cougars are respectful, outstanding, academic, responsible, and safe.  The goals for our students are to have respect 
and demonstrate responsibility, possess honesty and compassion, develop healthy
 
social skills, see the necessity to 
become part of the community 

 
through being actively involved in community service 

 
and to abstain from poor choices. 
Parent involvement greatly increases the schools ability to accomplish these goals.
 
 
For more infor
mation on how to become involved at the school, contact PTO President Tracee Kelly at

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety Plan is annually reviewed and amended in November of 
every school year. As part of this annual review 
process, the School Safety Plan is distributed to law enforcement and fire personnel and their feedback is used to revise 
the plan as needed.  Procedures for various emergencies are contained within the plan
 
and practiced throughout the 
school year. A copy of the School Safety Plan is located in the school office and was last reviewed, updated and discussed 
with faculty in the fall of 2019.  Students and staff participate in emergency preparedness efforts whi
ch include routine 
drills such as fire evacuation, earthquake and lockdown drills.
 
 
The goals in our Safe School Plan include:
 
Create a school environment that prevents physical, verbal, social, and electronic media harassment and bullying through 
the proc
ess of educating students, parents, and staff and providing research
-
based resources and support for changing 
student behavior.  By June of 2020, the percent of students surveyed that report being bullied will be reduced by at least 
5% compared to the prio
r year. The physical environment at Grant School will be considered safe and welcome by all 
stakeholders.  By June of 2020, Grant School will improve the lowest scoring demographic by 5% or more from the prior 
year while maintaining a 95% score for all oth
er demographics of feeling safe and welcome at Grant School.
 
 

at the school. The district recently provided first aid and CPR train
ing for many of our staff assigned to yard supervision 
duties.  Additionally, a total of 20 security cameras, fully fenced student areas, and the use of two
-
way radio 
communication between playground supervisors help to ensure a safe school environment.  S
taff members who provide 
supervision on the playground have been trained in Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports to help promote 
student safety.  The district also uses the Second Step social skills curriculum to teach students to listen, pay atte
ntion, 
control their behavior,  and get along with others.  The emphasis is placed in the lower elementary grades to serve as 
prevention for behavior issues as the students get older.

Professional development for all employees is a high priority in the Grant Elementary School District. Coursework taken 
by teachers is aligned with individual 
professional development plans and reviewed each year by the administration and 
teachers. On
-
site workshops are presented to teachers to develop instructional best practices that are aligned to the 
common core standards in english language arts, math, cont
ent areas, and technology.
 
 
For the previous three school years, Grant School has had five days each year dedicated to staff and professional programs. 
These were both formal and informal, on and off campus. In addition to the full days, the district provi
des 20 minimum 
days that allow staff to collaborate and hold parent/teacher conferences.  The purpose of Professional Development is to 
develop required skills and competencies necessary to accomplish instructional and grade
-
level goals and objectives, gro
w 
personally and professionally, expand their creativity, and enhance communication between colleagues.  Recent trainings 
that have been offered include Suicide Prevention, CPR/First Aid Certification, Trauma Informed Practices, Ed Tech, Google 
certificati
on, English Language Arts curriculum review and adoption workshops, Next Generation Science Standards, 
Restorative Chats, Common Core Math, PBIS, Foster/Homeless Youth, and CAASPP preparation.  There has also been a 
recent emphasis on the development of a 
writing curriculum continuum for grades TK
-
8th grades.  Funding for state 
standards implementation was used to fund some of our professional development efforts, as was the recent Educator 
Effectiveness funding.
 
 
In addition to the staff development days, 
the district added a .26 FTE Educational Technology Adviser to provide ed tech 
support to both students and teachers.  We also participate in trainings and collaboration opportunities provided through 
the Shasta County Office of Education.
 
 
In the developm
ent of the 2018
-
19 LCAP, Goal #3 Staff Development language was changed to reflect the district's 
responsibility to insure that all personnel, not just classroom personnel, receive training to build capacity and expertise i
n 
their respective areas of respo
nsibility.  With that we have recently sent our Transportation Lead to a state
-
wide forum 
for training and have enrolled a group of paraprofessionals in some off
-
campus training opportunities.  Training is 
extended to and required in our building maintenan
ce and operations and our food services teams as well.
