By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School is clean and the grounds are well maintained. Staff, students, and parents work together

classroom.
 
 
Grovecenter continues to meet the educational needs o
f its students as demonstrated by continued academic 
achievement results.  Staff evaluates its testing data yearly in order to effectively provide instructional strategies that a

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information 
relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general ed
ucation population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs
 
items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses tha
t satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern at every school throughout the District. Each school complies with laws, 

r 
preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are 


 
School Plans are reviewed annually by a law enforcement officer (usually our School Resource Officers from 

updates are completed if a sch
ool discipline policy is added or modified, changes are made to the campus map, additions 
and/or modifications are made to the telephone trees, etc. All visitors must check in at the school office and wear a visitor
 
badge while on school grounds. During lu
nch, recesses, and before and after school, staff members supervise students 
and school grounds, including the cafeteria and playgrounds, to ensure a safe and orderly environment. The 
Comprehensive School Safety Plan was developed by administrators, other 
school staff members, and Los Angeles County 
Office of Education staff members. It is reviewed, approved, and evaluated by the School Site Council in cooperation with 
local law enforcement in order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997. The plan provides 
students and staff a means to 
ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. Components of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan include the 
following: child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response 
procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress from school, sexual harassment policy, and suspension and expulsion 
policies. The plan is reviewed annually with school staff. An updated copy is available to the public at the school and 
District Office.
