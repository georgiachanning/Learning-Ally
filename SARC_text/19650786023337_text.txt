By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a 
School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the 
condition and performance of each California public school. 
Under the
 
Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a 
Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activitie
s to address state and local 
priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent 
with data reported in the 
SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Departm
ent of 
Education (CDE) SARC web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF w
eb page at 
https://www.cde
.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community 
members should contact the school principal or the district office.
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data too
l located on the CDE DataQuest w
eb page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and 
comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a 
dynami
c system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high 
school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other 
locations that are publicly accessible 
(e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is 
generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the 
hours of operation, the 
length of time that a workstation may be used (depending on 
availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to 
print documents.

., California Assessment of Student Performance and 
Progress [CAASPP] System,

includes the Smarter Balanced Summative 
Assessments for student
s in the general education population and the 
California 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and 
mathematics given in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible 
students may participate in the administratio
n of the CAAs. CAAs items are aligned 
with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State 
Standards [CCSS] for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and

ompleted courses that satisfy the 
requirements for entrance to the University of California and the California State 
University, or career technical education sequences or programs of study.

The Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP) is reviewed and updated annually by the 
School Safety/Parent Advisory Committee and approved by the Boa
rd of Education. Members 
of the Safety Committee include law enforcement. The Plan encompasses: (1) an assessment 
of the current status of school crime and climate; and (2) strategies, policies, and programs 
that provide/maintain a high level of school saf
ety, including child abuse reporting, disaster 
response, suspension/expulsion, dress code, bullying, discrimination, and harassment.  A 
copy of the CSSP is available on the school website and in the school office.
