By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Hoover Elementary School of Fine Arts is located on a quiet, residential street in the Whittier Hills. The school was designe
d 
in 1938 by the architect Wi
lliam Harrison. The school is full of rich history and has much aesthetic integrity. At the front of 
the school, all who enter can read the quote, "What you would have in the life of a nation you must first put forth in its 
schools."  The entire school com
munity of Hoover teachers, parents, paraprofessionals, and administration is dedicated 
to providing students with a challenging, age
-
appropriate curriculum based on California State Standards and 21st Century 
Learning. Hoover educators receive ongoing prof
essional development to put best practices for classroom instruction into 
action. All Hoover School teachers are highly qualified, and the staff is committed to meeting in Professional Learning 
Communities, where grade levels collaborate to provide systema
tic lessons and interventions to ensure student learning.
 
 
The mission of Hoover School of Fine Arts is to empower life long learners in the global community by supporting the 
whole child in a 21st century learning environment that develops critical thinki
ng, collaboration, creativity, and 
communication skills. All Hoover students receive high quality instruction to meet California State Standards in English 
Language Arts, Writing, and Mathematics and have access to standards aligned instructional materials
. Teachers receive 
professional development in strategies to use for reading, writing, and math that help students to collaborate, create, 
communicate and use more critical thinking skills. Teachers have been increasing their knowledge base every year in 
r
egards to Balanced Literacy, especially in Writer's Workshop. This year, the staff will move forward with the components 
of Balanced Literacy in Reading, i.e., Reader's Workshop, Word Work, Shared Reading, Interactive Reading, etc. These 
teaching methods a
llow teachers to access the California State Standards in ELA, while meeting the needs of 21st Century 
Learning. We will continue to work with Momentum in Teaching, a consulting group who provides professional 
development for the staff in Balanced Literacy
. All teachers are using the Eureka Math Curriculum which provides access 
to the Math State Standards, including perseverance in problem solving, solving math problems with real world 
applications, learning to use the appropriate tools to solve problems, a
nd learning to share and defend their decision on 
how to solve problems. Teachers also receive professional development with California State Math Standards, and 
coaching from the district coach in learning how to create and present lessons which help stud
ents to meet the standards. 
We have a Curriculum Lead Teacher who works with teachers to learn strategies and methods that will help all students 
access the California State Standards. In addition, the Lead teacher helps to provide information to parents a
bout the 
California State Standards.
 
 
Hoover Elementary School of Fine Arts believes in developing the whole child through academic knowledge, building 
strong character, and having exposure to Visual and Performing Arts. Students receive instruction in all
 
four art standards, 
including a 45 minute weekly class for music and drama.  All classes present a dance number at the annual Hoover 
Program, and all students receive instruction in visual arts and other visual arts projects. A local Whittier Dance Instru
ctor 
provides each classroom with dance lessons for the school performance. Our Kindergarten students take part in Violin 
Lessons during the year. Students in 3rd through 5th grade can be part of the Hoover Chorus, which performs often at 
school functions,
 
and at a variety of places in the Whittier Community. Nearly 25% of our students participate in the school 
musical and practice once a week for the performance in January. The staff is aware that 21st
-
century learning must 
provide opportunities to create 
things, communicate and express ideas and thoughts, collaborate with others, and be a 
critical thinker. All of these things can be achieved through the arts, as the students learn to create projects through visu
al 
arts, express themselves in drama and danc
e, collaborate with peers in music and drama presentations, and think critically 
about information they receive about famous art, and/or artists.

materials aligned with the State Standards. Currently, all teachers in grades K
-
8 have access to math curriculum that 
supports teaching the CA Common Core Math Standards.  Elementary grades use Eureka Math curriculum, which includes 
student workboo


Reading and Writing Units of Study
 
to support reading and writing instruction for all teachers in grades K
-
8. The Reading 
and Writing Units of Study are aligned to the standrads and were designed to match the rigor of the new CA Reading and 
Writing Common Core Standards. The District also 
purchased classroom libraries for each grade level to support the 
diverse reading abilities in each classroom. Curriculum was purchased to ensure students acquire the foundational reading 
skills needed for early literacy skills. Phonics, Spelling, & Word S
tudy System by Fountas & Pinnell was purchased for grades 
K
-
3 to help students attend to, learn about, and efficiently use sounds, letters, and words. In addition, Classroom Shared 
Reading materials by Fountas & Pinnell were purchased for grades K
-
2 to hel
p build a strong early reading foundation. A 
process is in place for schools to order materials at the beginning of each school year for all students. In addition, there 
is 
a process to order additional materials throughout the year to address the changing
 
needs of a schools student population, 

classes so appropriate materials can be ordered.  Our school complies with the Williams Law; e
very child has an 
appropriate textbook for all academic subjects requiring textbooks. Students are allowed to take textbooks home  to study 
after school when needed. The school uses district and categorical funds to provide supplemental materials for class
rooms 
including classroom library books, as well as materials for intervention and ELD. Finally, WCSD has an established a 
thorough process for examining new instructional materials as they become available. With the full implementation of 
the California S
tate Standards, the District will use the process to examine, explore, pilot and adopt new curriculum 
materials aligned with the CCSS, with input and feedback from teachers, administrators and parents. Based on the 
recommendation from the Department of Edu

to ensure that the most appropriate materials are identified for our students.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Hoover School was built in 1938.  It has seventeen classrooms and one small room used for our Resource Specialist and 
Speech programs.  Hoover has a large school library, a 
Multipurpose Room and three play areas 
--
 
one for our kindergarten 
students, one for students in grades 1
-
2 and a larger area for students in grades 3
-
5.  Hoover School was originally built as 
a Works Progress Administration (WPA) Project in the 1930s, as 
a part of our nation's recovery after the Great Depression.  
Two wings were added to the original structure in the 1950s and 1960s to meet the needs of our growing community.  
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, nine portable classrooms were added.  Hoover Sch
ool has received good maintenance 
and renovation (painting inside and outside, new carpet, central air and heat, internet access, etc.) through the years. A 
new roof was added in 2013, the kindergarten playground was recently renovated.  In the spring of 2
014, the front of the 
school received new fencing to establish a single point of entry and the office was modernized to improve service to 
families and visitors. In the fall of 2014, a new electronic marquee was installed.
 
 
Hoover School is cleaned on a re
gular basis through the services of our custodial team, which is made up of two full
-
time 
custodians, one for the day, and one for the evening.
 
 
Our campus is very safe.  It is surrounded on two sides by private family homes.  The back boundary of the scho
ol is a 
steep hillside that has no access.  The only way that the school can be accessed is through the front of the campus, which 
is fenced/gated and monitored by our staff.  No one is allowed past the front office without a visitor badge.  Students are 
k
ept safe before, during and after school by our exceptionally vigilant staff.  Our Safety Aide watches students in front of 
the school daily, beginning at 7:50 as she runs our Valet Drop Off Program and again after school for our Valet pick
-
up 
service.  Af
ter school, students can participate in either the Reach for the Stars After School Program or the Whittier Youth 
Network Program.  Those who do not participate in either of these programs are watched by our staff until they are picked 
up or walk home.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Hoover 
School of Fine Arts, parents have a variety of opportunities to be involved with their child and the school 
community. The expectation is for every parent to volunteer 10
-
20 hours each year at the school. This can include 
volunteering in the classroom, hel
ping out in the office, attending parent meetings, participating in parent clubs, etc.Our 
Parent Faculty Organization (PFO) conducts fundraisers and social functions that benefit our entire school community. 
The money raised by the PFO funds field trips fo
r every grade level, assemblies, reading applications for technology, and 
educational materials for our students. Their social activities provide opportunities for parents, students and staff to meet
 
together for recreation and learning. They work to be of
 
service to the students and families of Hoover.  Parents can also 
get involved in our Hoover Dad's Club who helps build our sets for our yearly school musical along with other various 
projects.  We have grandparents, mothers, aunts, uncles, and friends wh
o all enjoy supporting our children through their 
involvement with this group.  The Dad's Club hosts many fun events, such as kickball games and car washes.  Their goal is 
to raise money to support and improve the facilities of the school. We are proud of 
our group and the difference that they 
make for our school and our community.
 
 
Parents can become involved in School Site Council (SSC). This group is made up of five parents and five staff members 
who are voted in by the school community. It is the respon
sibility of the SSC to manage all site categorical programs and 
funds. Parents enjoy this committee because it provides them with up
-
to
-
the minute information on some of our most 
important school programs and initiatives. Parents can also be part of our En
glish Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) 
which provides an opportunity to lead and to serve. Their responsibility is to provide  input and advisement to the SSC on 
matters pertaining specifically to English Learners. Overall, our parent groups are of vital 
importance to the ongoing 
progress and success of our school.
 
 
We also have Family Nights at Hoover where parents can join their children and learn fun ways to incorporate math, 
science, reading, and art  at home. This year we will have three Family Nights
 
this year: Math Night & Science Night, 
Literacy Night, and Art Night. In addition, we have 6
-
8 parent education meetings each year, with topics ranging from 
helping children with homework, to cyberbullying, to helping children become leaders. The meetings
 
are part of our Parent 
Coffee Club, which is coordinated by our Parent Liaison. We also have Reading Days with Family four times throughout 
the year with the purpose of building students' identity as Readers.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Hoover School provides a safe and clean facility for our students. In order to ensure the safety of students, we ask that all
 
volunteers and visitors sign
-
in in the office and obtain a visitor's sticker. Students and staff members know to look for such 
a b
adge on any unknown adult on campus as well as to report adults without badges to the office. Substitute teachers are 
also assigned a brightly colored badge to wear that shows students and staff that they too belong on campus. Students 
are released only to
 
persons whose names are listed on the school emergency cards and who provide picture identification 
attesting to identity. If a student is ill or has a medical appointment, we maintain a special release and sign
-
out process. 
Careful precautions are taken 
to abide by particular custody arrangements that parents make us aware of.
 
 
Hoover School has a well
-
organized disaster preparedness plan that includes updated emergency equipment and supplies 
which was reviewed, updated, and discussed on December 11, 2019
. In accordance with SB187 and EC 35294.6, all schools 
have adopted a Safe School Action Plan. These plans are reviewed annually are available for public view in the school 
office. Disaster drills, lockdown,  and fire drills are conducted monthly. Our Heal
th Aide is trained in First Aid and CPR, as 
are most of the teachers and the principal. The Health Aide assists students in the event of minor injury as well as in 
routine health issues. Additionally, a positive relationship exists between Hoover School an
d the Whittier Police 
Department. They support us with law and traffic enforcement when needed, as well as providing annual safety 
assemblies for the students.
 
 
Hoover school has implemented our PBIS, a Character Education Program, of the "HAWKS Way." The 
program helps 
support the entire staff to teach the children the importance of building strong character traits, including, but not limited
 
to: respect, kindness, fairness, and honesty. On Fridays, we have Peace Picnic for the students who have exemplified
 
the 
HAWKS Way characteristics throughout the week. Finally, teachers and administration work together on PBIS (Positive 
Behavior Intervention Supports) to recognize the positive behaviors students demonstrate, and to decrease negative 
behaviors displayed.
 
This plan allows for teachers to teach the behaviors we want and utilize interventions to reshape 
behaviors, before moving to consequences with the child. There are many incentives built into PBIS to reward the positive 
behaviors and to recognize the work
 
the students are doing to be good citizens at their school. The school records all 
negative behaviors into the SWIS program, and then the site PBIS team analyzes the data to determine how to best address 
the behavior needs of the students.

Whittier City School District leaders understand the importance of ongoing, in
-
depth professional development directly 
connected to school learn
ing goals. Professional Development is based on the analysis of district and site data and is 
provided during the summer, on Tuesday early release days and teacher release time and after school. All teachers have 
attended professional development on the ke
y concepts of Professional Learning Communities to empower them in 
making critical instructional decisions for all students. In addition, teachers have learned how to create common formative 
assessments, analyze student performance data on state and local 
assessments, and have acquired a wide range of 
knowledge and skill in the area of lesson design and standards
-
based planning. District Instructional Coaches work with 
teams of teachers to enhance the level of expertise in PLCs, lesson design and standards
-
based instruction. All teachers 
have access to a curriculum that is aligned to the Common Core standards and receive ongoing support and professional 
development through training and instructional coaching. In addition, all K
