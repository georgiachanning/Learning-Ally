By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
McCabe Union Elementary School District occupies approximately 3
5 acres of property at the corner of McCabe and Austin 
Roads in Imperial County. This includes 20 acres west of the main McCabe campus that were purchased from Mr. And 
Mrs. Virgil Corfman in 2006. The development of this property was completed during the s
ummer of 2008 and the Corfman 
portion of the District is used to house students in 4th through 8th Grade and was officially opened in the fall of 2008.
 
 
McCabe Union Elementary School District is located just southwest of El Centro. Our TK through 8th Grad
e district is 
considered a rural school that feeds into the Central Union High School District. California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement 
Data System (CALPADS) enrollment for Fall 2018 was 1,365 students. The socioeconomics of the school community are 
comp
rised of a wide range of occupations, from professionals to unskilled laborers. One indicator of the economic status 
is the number of federally funded free or reduced lunches served in the District. The Fall 2018 Unduplicated Pupil 
Percentage (UPP) was 37.

goal to continue with a 24:1 in TK through 3rd Grade.  The  was designated a California Distinguished School during the 
2005
-
2006, and 2011
-
2012 school years. The
 
California Department of Education recognized the McCabe Union 
Elementary School District as an outstanding educational program and awarded the District the California Gold Ribbon 
Schools Award during the 2015
-
2016 school year.
 
 
Our mission is to be the m
odel of educational excellence, innovation and leadership. We are committed to work 
collectively with students, families, and the community. We are dedicated to provide a safe and conducive environment 
for learning.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
August 2019
 
 
It is a priority at McCabe School that there are sufficient textbooks and other instructional materials to appropriately 

onal program. Each student is supplied with textbooks that have been adopted by the State 
of California, for use at home and in the classroom. New textbooks in specific subject areas are purchased according to a 
schedule prescribed by the State. Staff memb
ers make recommendations for textbooks and instructional materials to the 
administration for the final decision. On the average, textbooks are expected to last from five to six years. Prior to the fi
rst 
year of implementation, teachers, administrators, and
 
instructional support personnel are trained in the use of the new 
textbooks and materials.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most 
Recent Year)
 
 
General: The District takes great efforts to ensure the District is clean, safe, and functional. Below is more specific 
information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to insure students are provided with a clean, safe, and 
f
unctional learning environment.

Safety: Staff members supervise students during morning, lunch, and other normally scheduled recesses. Considering the 
school site is located in the country, staff members are on constant alert for vehicles or 
visitors that appear out of place. 
Visitors are required to check in at the main office prior to proceeding to their destination through our Raptor
-
 
Visitor 
Management System. The Raptor system allows us to screen visitors, contractors, and volunteers in o
ur schools and 
provides us with a safer environment for our students and staff.  The safety of our students is our highest priority and the 
Raptor visitor management system allows us to quickly identify those that may present a danger to our students.  For
 
incident reporting and escalation we have implemented Catapult EMS
-
 
software enhances the safety of students and staff 
with real
-
time communication and information management. For students who participate in sports or other after
-
school 
activities, superv
ision is provided until students are picked up or other means of transportation/supervision is arranged. 
All other students either ride the bus or are picked up during their scheduled dismissal time.  Parents can provide 
temporary permission for alternativ
e travel. This process is monitored through the McCabe School blue note process. Fire 
drills are conducted monthly and evacuation maps are posted throughout the school. Safety meetings are conducted 
throughout the year and administration is available to st
aff, parents, and students concerning all issues addressing safety.
 
 
During the 2019
-
20 school year, the dirt lot behind the McCabe Campus which is used for overflow parking was approved 
to receive funding through the APCD Clean Air Trust Fund for a Dust A
batement Pilot Project.  The site preparation and 
sealant materials funded through this project resulted in a significant improvement to our campus, with regard to safety 
and especially to the air quality.
 
 
The Corfman portion of the campus opened during t
he fall of 2008 and a new bus shed was constructed on the southeast 
portion of the property; the old bus shed was removed from the property during the 2008
-
09 school year.  The Corfman 
side has four main wings with 30 classrooms and a science lab, a cafete
ria/multipurpose room with attached band room, 
a library building with two attached classrooms, two portable classrooms on the west side of the campus, and a 
school/district administrative building. Students in grades 4
-
8 attend classes in the Corfman sect
ion of the campus.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and 
working order are completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that 
e
mergency repairs are given the highest priority. McCabe School did not experience any emergency concerns related to 
gas leaks, non
-
functioning heating, ventilation, or air conditioning systems, electrical power failure, major sewer line 
stoppage, pest or v
ermin infestation, broken gates or windows that pose a security risk, undiscovered hazardous materials, 
or structure damage creating a hazardous or uninhabitable condition.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.
