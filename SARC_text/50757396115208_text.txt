School Description
 
Our school is a beautifully designed campus. It is named after Dennis G. Earl, a former Trustee of 
the Turlock Joint Elementary School Board, who died in 1985. It is designed to be a community
-
oriented campus where families enjoy recreational activities af
ter school hours and on the 
weekends. Our multipurpose room is used extensively for a variety of community functions during 
the evenings and weekends. We have a closed circuit television program that broadcasts to every 
classroom each morning with the dail

 
 
There are three significant student populations according to our CBEDS information; English 
Learners, Hispanic and those students that are Socio
-
Economically Disadvantaged. According to our 
Language Census, ther
e are 12 different languages spoken by our students. 25% of Earl's student 
population are English Language Learners while 42% are Hispanic. As a result, we have a rich 
cultural and linguistic diversity in our school community.
 
 
Earl's teachers continue to 
seek more effective ways to differentiate their curriculum and provide 
appropriate academic support for each individual child. At our monthly faculty, leadership and 
Professional Learning Community collaborative team meetings, teachers regularly discuss 
su
mmative and formative assessment data, develop rubrics to measure student work, and plan 
intervention and enrichment supports to better meet the learning needs of the students. In 
addition, our Kindergarten teachers offer literacy support for struggling fi
rst grade students. 
Teachers also enlist the support of our district Instructional Coaches to observe lessons and provide 
feedback on how to improve their lesson delivery. We have a reading specialist and an English 
Language Development teacher on campus w
ho provide strategic, intensive small group and one
-
on
-
one instruction to targeted students in reading and English language development.
 
 
We also maintain a close working relationship with our local University, California State University, 
Stanislaus, We h
ave over 100 tutors, mentors, and observers come into our classrooms to provide 
support. We also host a number of student teachers each year in our TK
-
6 classrooms. In addition, 
several university methodology classes are taught on campus with the Universit
y students 
providing additional instructional and intervention support to our Earl students.
 
 
Earl School is proud to recognize and celebrate students' academic and social accomplishments. 
Our monthly Excellent Explorer Assemblies highlight students for a 
variety of personal strengths 
based on the character traits found in our Character Counts Program such as respect and 
responsibility. We also honor two Rotary Club Students of the month throughout the year. Children 
that are "caught in the act of doing som
ething good" are also recognized. All students in grades 1
-
6 receive music instruction each week and our fifth and sixth grade students are encouraged to 
participate in our choir, band and orchestra music programs. Students are involved in groups and 
activ
ities including Student Council (fifth and sixth grades) and the Student Safety Patrol (fifth and 
sixth grade). An after school play program, operated by the City of Turlock Recreation Department, 
is available to all children and is located in our multipur
pose room. The program provides help for 
students with homework, activities, and a safe place for students to stay after school.
 
 
We have a dedicated and caring group of parents and volunteers. These wonderful people give 
countless hours of their time in c
lassrooms and attend School Site Council and PTA functions.

The PTA supports teachers and programs throughout the school. They host different fundraisers throughout the year and put on 
a whole 
school spring carnival, all of these are aimed at raising funds to support student field trips and additional school projec
ts. We appreciate 
our parents' commitment to our school and to their children's education.
 
 
We believe in the Turlock Unified Mission Statement which reads: The mission of the Turlock Unified School District, a premie
r progressive 
educational system, is to
 
ensure all students graduate as self
-
motivated, responsible citizens equipped to compete successfully in an ever 
changing global society by delivering effective instruction that engages all students to reach their individual potential and
 
highest 
achievem
ents within a safe and caring student
-
centered environment in partnership with our families and diverse community.
 
 
The vision of Dennis G. Earl Elementary School is; we believe all Explorers will achieve at high levels within a safe, suppor
tive, 
compassio
nate, and collaborative community.
 
 

 
Excellent Students, Awesome Citizens, Readers, and Learners for life!
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school 
in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educa
tional agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally
, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

, and an additional
 
instructional paraprofessional dedicated to English Learners. We also have a Language Lab in which our newcomer students and

students use a specialized computer program designed to support English language acquisition.

a comprehensive school

students who need it. We believe that in addition to teaching the rigorous academic content standards that we focus on ever

on helping students with their social emotional learning skills. Social Emotional Skills are crucial pre

requisites for success in life (e.g., mastery of 
standards, positive peer relationships, and employment success).
