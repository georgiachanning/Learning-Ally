Principal's Message
 
Welcome to Saratoga Elementary School! As a center of public education for the 
Saratoga 
community since 1854, we are proud of our history and strive to be a school that prepares students 
for the 21st Century in a caring learning environment that meets the needs of the whole child.
 
 
We do this by providing rigorous standards
-
based ins
truction alongside well
-
developed parent and 
community partnerships. Students develop as mathematicians through the Eureka Math program, 
which develops foundational skills in operational mathematics and builds fluency with multiple 
approaches to problem so
lving. We are also continuing to grow workshop model based reading 
instruction by using Daily 5/CAFE strategies and Units of Study writing curriculum. Our students 
access Next Generation Science Standards across all grade levels. Students in grades 1
-
5 hav
e 1:1 
access to Chromebooks and all students have hands
-
on learning opportunity in our Makerspace. 
Parent and community partners include the Saratoga Educational Foundation, the Saratoga 
Elementary Parent
-
Teacher Association, School Site Council, Project C
ornerstone, and the Saratoga 
Alumni Association. These groups are critical partners who support student enrichment such as 
hands
-
on science labs, our school garden, fine arts and physical education instruction, library, 
centers for small group instruction,
 
reading intervention programs, character education, and 
student support services.
 
 
Finally, we are grateful for our enthusiastic and involved parent community. Whether its 
participating in the PTA, volunteering for a field trip or school event, supporting
 
students in our 
community garden, or simply being an advocate for your student, I encourage you to get involved 
in whatever way works best for you and your family. Our parents are essential partners, 
collaborators, and a valued presence at our school.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

All instructional materials in the core curriculum in Saratoga Union School District are aligned to the California Content St
andards and Frameworks. SUSD 
adheres to CA Education Co
de and AB 1246, which gives school districts freedom, decision making, and choice in selecting instructional materials, and 
requires: implementing the California Common Core State Standards; equal access to current curriculum materials; change in th
e adopt
ion cycle; local 
school districts can choose their own adoption review process; and classroom teachers will be a major contributor in local ad
option processes.
 
 
SUSD students have access to standards
-
based instructional materials, as per EC Section 60119(c
)(1), which states that sufficient textbooks or 
instructional materials means, "each pupil, including English Learners, has a standards
-
aligned textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class 
and to take home. This paragraph does not require 
two sets of textbooks or instructional materials for each pupil." This specifically applies to four subject 
areas: reading/language arts, mathematics, science, and history
-
social science.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district takes great efforts to 
ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional through proper facilities maintenance and campus supervision. 
Saratoga Elementary School's original facilities were built in 1854; ongoing maintenance and campus improvements ensure facil
ities remain 
up to date 
and provide adequate space for students and staff. District maintenance and site custodial staff ensure that the repairs nece
ssary to keep the school in 
good condition are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used by school and 
district staff to communicate non
-
routine maintenance 
requests. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Various improvements are needed throughout the year as identified. Annual inspections and tests were completed for the fire a
larm/sprinkler/h
ydrant, 
fire extinguishers, post indicator valve and backflow, elevator and stage lifts, kitchen hoods and fire systems, bathroom har
dware, and preventative 
maintenance on sewers.  Weed abatement and pest control is monitored and performed.  Every room rec
eives deep cleaning in the summer. Preventative 
maintenance is performed on all HVAC units. Playgrounds are inspected annually and any necessary repairs are completed and ne
w sand is applied.
 
 
Every morning before school begins, the day custodian inspects 
facilities for safety hazards or other conditions that need attention prior to students and 
staff entering school grounds. One Day custodian and one evening custodian are assigned to Saratoga Elementary School. The da
y custodian is responsible 
for general 
grounds maintenance, cleaning the restrooms, multi
-
purpose room, trash removal, and preparing the school for opening. The evening 
custodian is responsible for cleaning the classrooms and trash removal.
 
 
The principal communicates with custodial staff daily
 
concerning maintenance and school safety issues.

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students w
ho met the standard (i.e.,
 
achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this c
ategory is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the 
number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using o
nly students who received scores.

School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan (CSSP) was developed for each school in SUSD in collaboration with the School Site 
Councils, the SUSD 
Emergency Planning Committee, local 
agencies (sheriff, fire department, and city government), and the district office to fulfill Senate Bill 187 
requirements. The CSSPs were approved by the district's board of trustees before March 1st.  Components of this plan include 
information assessing 
the 
current status of school crime committed on school campus and at school related functions, strategies and programs that provi
de or maintain a high 
level of school safety, procedures for complying with existing laws related to school safety, including c
hild abuse reporting procedures, teacher 
notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe arrival and departure from scho
ol, sexual harassment 
policy, and dress code policy.
 
 
The school's most recent school safe
ty plan was reviewed, updated, and discussed with school staff annually at the beginning of the school year. The 
most current copy of the school plan is available in the school office for public review. For additional information on schoo
l safety programs,
 
policies, 
procedures, and how you may become involved, please contact the school principal.
