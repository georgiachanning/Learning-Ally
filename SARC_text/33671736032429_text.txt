About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible stu
dents 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Invo

Parents are provided with a variety of opportunities during the school year to actively participate in their child's educatio
n by attending monthly events 
such as Family Education nights, School Site Council, and family events
 
such as the annual Harvest festival, Father/Daughter dance, Mother /Son dance, 
and other PTA sponsored events. Formal parent conferences are scheduled twice yearly, however, teachers are available to conf
erence with parents 
upon request. Opportunities to 
mentor and tutor individual students are available in each classroom. Parents may also participate in the classroom as 
volunteers. Families are encouraged to join the school's Parent/Teacher Association (PTA). This group plans and funds educati
onal assembl
ies and field 
trips. Educational decision
-
making opportunities are available through participation on several committees such as the School Site Council and the Englis
h 
Language Advisory Council.
 
 
At Bella Vista Elementary School, we provide accessibility 
and opportunities for parents with limited English proficiency, parents with disabilities, and 
parents of migratory students to participate in our school and the development of Bella Vista Elementary School's parent enga
gement policy by 
translating, into S
panish, all informational flyers, newsletters and school handbooks and handouts. The school will also provide an employee who
 
is able 
to translate during meetings and conferences.
 
All areas of the school campus are accessible by wheelchair for disabled par
ents.
 
 
Bella Vista staff and parents work collaboratively with the Parent Engagement Center to enhance parent engagement to support 
Bella Vista students.

situations. The Safe School 
Pl
an includes the school's emergency evacuation plan and procedures. An additional component of the Safe School Plan includes t
he implementation of 
Positive Behavior Supports (PBS).  Each classroom teaches mini
-
lessons that support positive behavior in and o
ut of the classroom.  School
-
wide 
expectations are posted throughout the building in common areas.  Expectations are reviewed and practiced throughout the year
. Expectations are also 
provided to students and parents at the beginning of the year along with 
the school discipline matrix.
 
The Safety plan was updated in July 2019.  A copy of the plan is available upon request.

Each year we have designed professional learning based on student achievement data, research of best practices and discussion
s with teachers and 
principals. In 2017
-
18, in response to stagnant test scores and challenges with collaborative planning, we bega
n working with Orenda/Principal Exchange. 
Since then, our teachers have been working to strengthen collaborative teams, refocus on essential standards and respond in a
 
timely manner to data 
from common assessments.  The focus was on ELA during the 2017
-
18 
and 2018
-
19 school years. An additional content area focus (Math) was added for 
the 2019
-
20 school year. At the same time, the school has been engaged in district
-
wide professional learning that varies by content area. For ELA, in 
2017
-
18, the focus was on
 
aligning instruction to Smarter Balanced Assessments, depth of knowledge, and deeper understanding of the Reading Targets 
in Claim 1. In 2018
-
19 the focus was on the gradual release model, and 2019
-
20 was an extension of the previous two years. The profes
sional development 
in these areas was provided by the Schoolhouse Project. In 2019
-
20 the teachers began working with High Impact Math consultants. This professional 

take place over the course of three years.  During Year 1 
(2019
-
20) the focus is on developing strategies to support number sense by implementing mental math routines and highlight the land
scape of learning 
in mathematics. This professional development als
o supports teachers with the implementation of the district
-
adopted math program (Bridges in 
Mathematics and Number Corner).
 
The numbers in the chart above represent 10 full days a year (2017
-
18 and 2018
-
19) in which structured coaching took place during D
ata Reflection 
Sessions and the remaining days are full days of professional learning in ELA as noted previously. During the 2019
-
20 school year, the numbers in the 
chart represent 15 days a year in which structured coaching takes place during Data Reflect
ion Sessions  (DRS) and the remaining days are full days of 
professional learning in ELA and Math.
