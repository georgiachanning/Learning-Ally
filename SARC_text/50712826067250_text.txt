By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/

For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Program Descriptions
 
School Based Coordinated Program (SBCP)
 
 
Title I, Title II, Title III, and Special Education programs are included in the School
-
Based Coord
inated Program (SBCP). 
These programs provide all students, including English Learners (EL), Gifted and Talented (GATE), and Special Education 
students with a rich variety of supplemental materials, equipment, activities and/or personnel. The School Plan d
escribes 
Title I, Title II, and Title III, and methods for each program's evaluation. The School Site Council (SSC) oversees the 
development and implementation of the school site plan.
 
 
Academic Adviser
 
A
 
full
-
time academic adviser is employed to help stu
dents with academic needs, conflict resolution and emotional support. 
 
 
Student Success Team (SST)
 
The Student Success Team meets, as referrals come to the the administration or the academic adviser, to discuss the 
specific needs of individual students wh
o are referred by staff or parents. The team consists of a site administrator, 
teachers, and the school academic adviser. The team attempts to identify causes that may be interfering with the child's 
success and provides recommendations for the parents and
 
teachers to consider in meeting the student's needs. The team 
may recommend that additional information be collected about the pupil before making recommendations or recommend 
that the pupil be referred for Special Education or 504 eligibility.
 
 
English L
anguage Learners Program (EL)
 
The English Language Learner (ELL) program philosophy is to provide an intensive English
-
Language Development Program 
for all English learners to afford them the opportunity to develop academically and socially to their fulle
st potential. We 
have based our EL program on the EL Roadmap Policy adopted by the California State Board of Education on July 12, 2017 
which embodies the following four principles: 
 
 
Principle #1: Assets
-
Oriented and Needs
-
Responsive Schools
 
Pre
-
schools 
and schools are responsive to different EL strengths, needs and identities, and support the socio
-
emotional 
health and development of English learners. Programs value and build upon the cultural and linguistic assets students 
bring to their education in sa
fe and affirming school climates. Educators value and build strong family, community, and 
school partnerships.
 
 
Principle #2: Intellectual Quality of Instruction and Meaningful Access
 
English learners engage in intellectually rich, 
developmentally appropriate learning experiences that foster high levels of 
English proficiency. These experiences integrate language development, literacy, and content learning as well as provide 
access for comprehension and participation through native l
anguage instruction and scaffolding. English learners have 
meaningful access to a full standards
-
based and relevant curriculum and the opportunity to develop proficiency in English 
and other languages.

Principle #3: System Conditions that Support Effectiv
eness
 
Each level of the school system (state, county, district, school, pre
-
school) has leaders and educators who are 
knowledgeable of and responsive to the strengths and needs of English learners and their communities, and utilize valid 
assessment and ot
her data systems that inform instruction and continuous improvement; resources and tiered support is 
provided to ensure strong programs and build the capacity of teachers and staff to build on the strengths and meet the 
needs of English learners.
 
 
Principl
e #4: Alignment and Articulation Within and Across Systems
 
English learners experience a coherent, articulated and aligned set of practices and pathways across grade levels and 
educational segments beginning with a strong foundation in early childhood and
 
continuing through to reclassification, 
graduation and higher education. These pathways foster the skills, language(s), literacy and knowledge students need for 
college
-
 
and career
-
readiness and participation in a global, diverse multilingual 21st century
 
world.
 
 
EL Program Goals
 
There are five program goals: 1) The student will comprehend spoken English; 2) the students will learn how to 
communicate their ideas orally in the English language; 3) the students will learn how to read and comprehend in Engli
sh 
to facilitate success within the regular program; 4) the students will learn to write in English, using correct grammar and 
vocabulary; and 5) the students will share their cultural background through classroom/school activities, thus enhancing 
their fe
eling of self
-
worth.
 
 
All English learners who are not reclassified, are enrolled in an English Language Development (ELD) classes in addition to 
benchmark ELA classes. The reclassified students' progress in the core program is regularly monitored. The lon
g term 
English Learners (LTELs) are coached and supported to be re
-
designated. All teachers hold either the Cross
-
cultural 
Language and Academic Development (CLAD), SB1969 or SB395 certificates. Two instructional bilingual paraprofessionals 
are used in cla
ssrooms to provide assistance to classroom teachers in providing ELD instruction to our students. Services 
are reviewed by the School Site Council, the principal and the English Learner Parents Advisory Committee (ELPAC).
 
 
English Learners are to 
receive designated English Language Development (ELD) from appropriately trained teachers. 
Integrated ELD instruction occurs on a regular basis in content area classes and focuses on the English Learners' individual 
strengths and weaknesses in relation to 
the District's Standards of Expected Pupil Achievement. The instruction takes 
place in the students' ELL class and/or with other qualified certificated teachers and programs. Cooperation between the 
classroom teacher and ELL staff is vital to ensure that a
ll students are receiving appropriate instruction. Trained EL 
paraprofessionals are also available to support the teachers and students.
 
 
English Learners are enrolled in all core subjects: ELA, Social Studies, Math, and Science. 
 
 
Professional Development
 
During the 2019
-
20 academic year, teachers are receiving professional development on the best research based 
instructional practices, Response to Intervention, and implementation of the Common Core State Standards.

s classes in ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies to serve the needs of High Achieving and GATE 
students. We also offer Math 1. The students who successfully complete Math 1 at Prescott do not have to take Math 1

Technology
 
The District's Master Plan for Educational Technology was used to develop the school sit
e's technology plan. The plan 
supports the integration of technology into the curriculum to improve student achievement. It also focuses on professional 
development opportunities for staff members. Prescott has the capacity to be connected internally and h
as been given 
wireless Internet access in every classroom. This has allowed Prescott to embark on an ambitious program towards 
including and incorporating technology as a regular part of the instructional program. The district maintains digital 
citizenship
 
and literary standards, taught by all teachers based on department or grade level. 
 
 
Prescott continues to enhance its technology capacity. Prescott now has 15 Chromebook carts with 36 chrome books in 
each cart. Since ELA teachers use the web
-
based progra
m, Study Sync, each of them have one cart each designated for 
them. Some carts are available for check out by teachers who use them occasionally. Prescott also have two computer 
labs with 34 computers each. Some classrooms have been equipped with media car
ts, which included laptop computers, 
speakers, a document camera, and an LCD projector. Internet capabilities have also allowed us to use our online 
attendance and grading program to help inform parents of their child's progress. The inclusion of a distric
t
-
wide 
automated call
-
home system has also helped with student communication. We are continuing to use web
-
based programs 
to enhance curriculum and improve intervention and are currently in various stages of implementation. 
 
 
The LCFF provides for technolo
gy funding in our LCAP through a digital device initiative and annual refresh budget.

Prescott teachers have participated in district wide professional development offered in CCSS ELA, Writing, New Teacher 
Training, Eureka Math, ELD, ELA Framework, Effective Instruction, Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), Social 
Studies, Physical Edu
cation and STEM. Our teachers have also attended Visible Learning training in which they have 
learned about different effect sizes on student learning. As a follow up to the Visible Learning training, our teachers 
continue to refine their learning outcomes
 
and success criteria. We have instituted weekly 60 minute PLCs on 
Wednesdays. On Wednesdays students are released early. Our teachers focus on the following areas during the 
collaboration time: 
 

 
Engaging in Professional Learning Communities
 

 
Response to In
tervention

extensive training on the curriculum, with follow up training still to come in the spring of 2020. 
 
 
Our district has hired three instructional coaches. They regularly work with our teachers to improve their instructional 
capacity in the academic areas of Math, Science ELA, and Social Studies. They also offer extensive training in classroom 
management and
 
research based effective instructional strategies. In January of 2020 the district will add an additional 
instructional coach, with extensive experience at the junior high school level.
