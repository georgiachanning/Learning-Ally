School Description
 
James E. Potter Junior High School is a state
-
of
-
the
-
art school that promotes an environment 
addressing the intellectual, social, emotional, and developmental needs of the adolescent learner. 
Teachers create a stimulating and rigorous learning environment 
that is grounded in California 
State Standards. Elective choices include broadcasting, leadership (Associated Student Body), 
chorus, instrumental music/band, yearbook, STEM Lab, STEAM Lab, Spanish as well as 
Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID).
 

students with the foundation to excel and the opportunity to be innovative and inventive.  Teachers 
in all subject areas follow the district
-
adopted instructional framework, and use a variety of 
teaching strategie
s and methodologies to address different learning needs. When students feel 
connected to school and have a positive relationship with an adult, they continuously grow and 
make positive, productive decisions. The administrators, teachers, counselors, and su
pport staff 
serve as mentors and role models to our students and continually monitor their academic and social 
progress. Social, emotional, and developmental needs of students are addressed through a wide 
variety of programs, resources, and personnel. The 

many student
-
led clubs provide a strong support network that keep students connected to school 
and serve as a conduit to further involvement in the learning experience. Potter Junior High School 
has adopted the Po
sitive Behavior Intervention and Support model where we set clear expectations 
for our students and provide positive incentives for good behavior. This support system has proven 
very effective toward creating a positive climate and culture on campus.
 
 
The 
mission of Potter Junior High School is to inspire students to find greatness within themselves. 
The Potter Junior High staff is committed to addressing three core beliefs: success breeds success, 
we control the conditions of success, and all students will
 
learn at a high level to achieve success.
 
 
The vision of Potter Junior High School learning community is committed to providing the safest 
and best educational program. We work to ensure our school provides a welcoming, stimulating 
environment. All studen
ts become leaders who engage in learning academics and positive 
behaviors. The Potter Junior High School staff is committed to develop leaders who have a college 
and career mindset and make positive contributions to their communities.

About the SARC
 
By Februa
ry 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fundin
g Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state an
d local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Potter Junior High School is committed to working with our parents to extend and enrich the school experience for all student
s. We believe in providing 
parents and families with regular 
communication through our school website, Peachjar flyers, "all calls," social media feeds, and our weekly 
communication folders. Opportunities for parents to engage in the school are outlined annually in our Parent and Family Engag
ement Plan. We welcome 
p
arents on our campus and annually offer a "Meet and Greet" before school begins, a Fall "Back To School Night," student
-
led parent conferences, Coffee 
and Conversation with the Principal, a "Leadership Day," Family STEM events, and a Spring "Open House." W
e offer a variety of parent volunteer, 
education, and engagement opportunities at our site. We encourage parents and community members to join the Parent Teacher St
udent Association 
(PTSA), and to participate by attending various school committee meetings 
such as School Site Council (SSC), English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) 
and Lighthouse Leadership Meetings. For more information regarding parent involvement opportunities please see the school sit

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Oth
er local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Each Fallbrook Union Elementary School District site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP), including a disaste
r preparedness plan 
annually. School administrators work closely with
 
local law enforcement, fire department and/or the Provost Marshall's Office on Camp Pendleton who 
review the plans and also participate in emergency drills, provide feedback, attend site and district safety meetings and col
laboratively help to improve 
ove
rall campus safety, climate, and security.  Copies of the Comprehensive School Safety Plans are available for review at each 
school office. The plan 
includes emergency procedures for school safety, natural disasters, and campus intruders. It also contains 
appropriate strategies and programs that will 

d to school safety. Students, 
teachers, and staff are trained to prepare for a wide r
ange of emergency situations, and frequent drills help to refine emergency skills, policies, and 
procedures at all school sites. Following each drill, specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to co
ntinually improve emergency 
proced
ures, and improve campus safety.
 
 
Finally, school and district administrators immediately investigate threats of harm. Teachers and administrators seek to fost
er lines of open 
communication
 
so students and parents feel comfortable reporting inappropriate activity including bullying, harassment, or threats. All FUE
SD staff take 
a strong stand against threatening behavior or bullying and investigate complaint matters fully. Many positive progr
ams exist districtwide to enhance 
and continually improve school culture and climate, including Positive Behavior Intervention and Support, Restorative Practic
es, Suicide Prevention, Anti
