About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by 
state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are re
quired to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is
 
to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Most of the school's repairs and maintenan
ce projects are 
performed by the 

ol custodian 
or district maintenance staff, based upon the nature of the situation. Day and evening custodians work closely as a te
am and with the principal for routine 
maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events preparations. The principal and day custodian communicate daily to di
scuss campus cleaning 
needs and safety concerns. Every morning before school begins, the cust
odian and principal inspect facilities for safety hazards, graffiti, and other 
conditions that require removal prior to students and staff entering school grounds. School safety and cleanliness are the cu

strongly emphasized a

for general campus maintenance. The day custodian checks restrooms twice a day as a proactive measure in keeping facilities w
ell stocked, safe, and 
sanitary. The evening custodians are responsible for thorough cleaning of classrooms, o

the district office to perform general maintenance of landscaping, gardening, sports fields, and irrigation systems.
