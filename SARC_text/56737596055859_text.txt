By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
January, 2020
 
 
All TK
-
12 students have current standards
-
based textbooks in math, 
science, history/social science, and English/language 
arts. With each curricular cycle established by the State of California, the Conejo Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) 
Board of Education adopts textbooks within the timeline provided. Standards
-
ali
gned books for grades 9
-
12 are approved 
locally. Textbooks in grades K
-
8 are selected from lists of books and materials approved by the State Board of Education. 
Sufficient standards
-
based textbooks and instructional materials have been purchased for all s
tudents in English, math, 
history/social science, science, health and foreign language. In addition, annually, sites receive specific science 
supplementary funds to be used for consumable laboratory expenses and/or equipment.
 
 
The process of selecting text
books and materials involves the formation of a committee charged with the responsibility of 
reviewing current state standards and frameworks, analyzing student data, writing courses of study (as required) and 
selecting and maintaining current instructiona
l materials. The goal of such district
-
wide committees comprised of teachers 
and administrators representing all targeted grade levels, is to achieve high academic standards for all of our TK
-
12 
students. Each major subject area, such as math, science, his
tory/social science, foreign language and English/language 
arts, is reviewed and adopted under the guidance of the California Department of Education and State Board of Education. 
The committee submits its recommendations to the Board of Education for fina
l approval. The recommendation to the 
Board includes the basic textbook materials as well as supplementary materials within the subject. On October 1, 2019, 
the CVUSD Board of Education approved a resolution for the 2019
-
2020 school year declaring that the
 
Conejo Valley 
Unified School District has provided each pupil with sufficient standards
-
based textbooks and instructional materials 
consistent with the cycles and content of the curriculum frameworks.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Each fall, a team that consists of all or many of the following personnel, inspects each school in the Conejo Valley Unified 
School District:  Site Administrator, Director of Maintenance and Operations, Director of Planning and New Construction, 
and the As
sistant Superintendent.  A facilities evaluation is completed documenting the condition of the school in a variety 
of areas including the cleanliness of restrooms, condition of roofs, paving and walkways, HVAC systems, landscape 
maintenance, etc.  Any obse
rved condition that represents a threat to the health and safety of students and staff is 
annotated for immediate correction.  Notes include items that could improve the utility, appearance, or safety of the 
school and are recorded and evaluated for potent

included on the final Major Projects List are based upon a priority assessment of all identified District schools' needs and 
the funds available to address those needs.  The Board of
 
Education approves the final list in the spring, so the majority of 

Maintenance Program represent a significant source of support for th
e annual Major Projects List each year.  The District 
revises and submits a Five
-
Year Deferred Maintenance Plan to the Office of Public School Construction and has had  no 
required contribution to the Deferred Maintenance Fund since the 2008
-
09 school year


Deferred Maintenance Program projects will be prioritized and financed with carryover funds from prev
ious budgets or 
as augmented by future funds.
 
 
The District provides 1.5 full
-
time custodians at Aspen Elementary and they follow District
-
defined cleaning standards and 
schedules to ensure that the school provides our students and staff with a clean, heal
thy, and attractive learning 
environment.  Aspen Elementary opened in 1967.  Sited on 10.98 acres of land, the school has 25 classrooms, a 
multipurpose room, a library, and an administration building.   The campus underwent modernization in 2005, replacing
 
and upgrading underground utilities, restrooms, doors, and improving accessibility under ADA.  The current capacity at 
Aspen is 400 students.   The most recent inspection was on December 23, 2019.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

The Conejo Valley Unified School District is committed to providing professional learning activities for all classified and 
certificated staff members.  Staff continues to enhance the skills necessary to deliver effective instruction through the 
implementa
tion of Common Core Standards. A robust professional learning effort includes opportunities in researched
-
based instructional strategies, technological competencies, and Professional Learning Communities. The District's Local 
Control Accountability Plan (L
CAP) prioritizes an entire goal with subsequent actions and services in order to "ensure highly 
qualified and effective staff are provided with targeted professional learning and have an understanding that all job 
responsibilities are structured to support
 
positive student outcomes."
 
 
Professional learning strategies such as workshops, institutes and academies, as well as job
-
embedded activities relate to 
College and Career Readiness, Positive Behavior Support, Smarter Balanced Assessments, and other requir
ed skills and 
competencies to meet the needs of all students. Professional learning topics align with District and school site needs 

Pro

 
 
The District also provides an accredited and free Teacher Induction Program to first and second year teachers, as well as 
both a voluntary and required
 
Peer Assistance Review program.
 
 
Site administrators receive continuous training at bi
-
weekly meetings and through a full
-
day training at the start of the 
school year. In addition, the Ventura County Office of Education offers a professional learning seri
es specifically designed 
for district and site administrators. Administrators attend workshops in Common Core Standards, Multi
-
Tiered System of 
Supports, performance assessment, social
-
emotional learning, supervision, evaluation, and leadership.
 
 
In additi
on to professional learning activities offered to the District's teachers and administrators, classified employees 
receive training that is specific to their assignments.
 
 
The District is committed to providing professional learning activities to every edu
cator to improve the instructional 
process and enhance student achievement. Teachers and administrators participate in three full
-
day trainings to support 
curriculum, instructional technology, assessment, report cards, instructional strategies, and the use
 
of data to teach all 
students.
