A Message from the Principal...
 
We are proud of Niemes Elementary. The administration and staff 
welcome this opportunity to provide you a 
glimpse of what we have to offer and to tell you more about our educational program.
 
 
Niemes Elementary is located in the City of Artesia, and hosts one of the largest elementary school enrollments 
in the ABC Unifi
ed School District.  Niemes Elementary has been honored as a California Gold Ribbon school, 
CA Title 1 Academic Achievement School, as well as a Magnet School of Distinction by Magnet Schools of 
America, the federal magnet school governing association.  Ni
emes has both a comprehensive environmental 
science and technology program as well as one of the few Award
-
winning Spanish
-
English Dual Immersion 
programs in the area. Niemes offers numerous after
-
school programs and activities, including an After School 
Y
MCA program, Track Club, Green Kids, Gardening Club, Botanical Society, Extended Day Care Program, 
Intervention Tutoring, as well as various activities and clubs throughout the school year. Our Environmental 
Nature Center allows students to learn about nat
ive California habitats and "green" activities.
 
 
It is not often that you find elementary students taking nature walks to identify plant life and parts, conducting 
on
-
going successional garden surveys in a nature habitat with wireless technology, investiga
ting rocks and 
minerals, nurturing and raising plants and live animals while studying their development, and participating in 

-
school clubs.  Here at Niemes, Environmental Science comes to life.   
The students at Niem
es Elementary School have successfully demonstrated academic achievement all the 
while keeping with our focus of environmental science and technology. Students make connections between 
decisions we make today and the ramifications they have on the environm
ent tomorrow and into the future.  

less and less time available for science instruction, students at Niemes attend science lessons in a state of the 
a
rt, hands
-
on environmental science lab in addition to environmental science instruction across all curriculum 
areas. Niemes has partnered our Science Lab and home classroom to address all components of our new Next 
Generation Science Standards Curriculum. 
To prepare students for a future filled with continuous advances in 
technology, the elementary school has a modern computer lab with Mac computers, while each classroom 
has a projection system, technology centers and access to mobile computer labs containi
ng enough wireless 
laptops and iPads for each student to research and produce authentic multimedia projects at the same time. 
Technology is integrated into the everyday curriculum, including a school
-
wide online reading program 
(Accelerated Reader). Niemes
 
has been awarded the Verizon Innovative Schools Grant! Only 12 schools were 
awarded in the United States, and 1 school in California. Our teachers and staff have attended and been 
provided professional development to successfully implement this new techno
logy. All 3rd

6th
-
grade students 
and staff are issued a device to expand educational opportunities. 2nd
-
grade students have 2:1 access to 
devices.  TK
-
2nd grade have iPad learning stations. Niemes is the leader in technology in ABC; we have adopted 
the fir
st 1:1 device initiative and hosted various guests to learn about what we are doing in our classrooms. 
We are excited to move forward in this endeavor.
 
 
I am pleased to announce that Niemes Elementary has been awarded the Golden Bell Award sponsored by the
 
California School Boards Association for our Environmental Science Fair and Festival Program. 
 
This is one of 
the most prestigious awards honoring outstanding programs in  California. Only about 45 programs are 
recognized in all of California. Additionall
y, our Dual Language program was nominated to be in the top 10 for 
an Award of Excellence from the Spanish Embassy. Our Dual Language Program was awarded the Seal of 
Excellence from CABE (California Association for Bilingual Education) for an outstanding p
rogram, only 1 school 
was recognized in California.
 
 
Niemes has officially been awarded the California Physical Activity and Fitness award by the CDE, as well as 
the bronze and gold level recognition by the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, Red Cross As

the Clinton Foundation. Niemes Elementary is now a Nationally Recognized Healthy School of America. Our

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Parents and community members are very supportive of the educational program at Niemes Elementary School. Staff members and p
arents participate 
on various committees that make decisions regarding the priorities and di
rections of the educational plan to ensure instructional programs are consistent 
with student's needs and comply with ABC's Strategic Plan Goals, LCAP and SPSA. We encourage parent engagement.
 
 
Parents are encouraged to participate in one or more of the fo
llowing committees or organizations:
 

 
PTA
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
Wellness Committee
 

 
Volunteering in and out of classrooms and on campus
 

 
VIP (Very Important Parent) volunteers to help with various activities and 
programs
 

 
Student Study Teams
 

 
Niemes Gardening
 
 
The School Site Council and the English Language Advisory Committee consisting of school staff, parents, and community member
s are the major 
governing bodies that meets regularly to address programs and compon
ents that make up the school, to discuss the effectiveness of the various programs 
in relation to student achievement, and to act as a liaison between the community and the school. Our active PTA also partner
s with the School Site 
Council to provide progra
ms, incentives, activities, and events that are correlated to our school vision and goals.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Niemes takes safety very seriously. Staff and students practice fire drills/earthquake drills, and evacuation every month.  S
tudents line up on the field, 
and all students are accounted for b
efore being grouped into larger pods to relieve staff for other emergency roles. The principal also has a Twitter and 
Communication System, and if technologies are up, will send a Twitter or text message to parents keeping them informed of the
 
status of th
e school and 
students.
 
Our plan was revised and updated. Our staff met to discuss and implement in October 2019.

Our teachers actively seek opportunities for professional growth to provide effective instruction 
with the focus on student learning.  Staff development 
is based on the assessed needs of the school personnel. Staff members work collaboratively to determine the school's needs an
d take direction from 
District and State requirements when establishing prof
essional development goals for the school year.  Schoolwide training focus areas include New 
adoption programs, English 
Learners, technology
, differentiation, using data to drive instruction, all with an emphasis on the CA Common Core Standards. 
Staff memb
ers build teaching skills and concepts by participating in conferences and workshops throughout the year and by sharing their
 
experiences 
and knowledge with colleagues, as well as coaching experiences. The District also offers professional development acti
vities.
