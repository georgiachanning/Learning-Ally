About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
On October 3, 2019, the Chino Valley Uni

and instructional materials have been provided to students. The Board of Education adopted Resolution 2019/2020
-
18 which certifies as required 
by 
Education Code 60119 that (1) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials have been provided to each student, including 
English learners, that are 
aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with the cycles and context of the curriculu
m frameworks in the following subjects: 
history/social science, mathematics, reading/language arts, and science, (2) sufficient textbooks or instructional materials 
were provided to each pupil 
enrolled in foreign language and/or health classes, (3) laborat
ory equipment was available for science laboratory classes offered in grades 9
-
12, inclusive.
 
 
Textbooks and instructional materials are provided for each student for use in class and to take home. It was determined that
 
each pupil in each school 
has suffi
cient textbooks and instructional materials that are aligned to the academic content standards in the core subject areas for 
the 2019/2020 school 
year. Additionally, sufficient textbooks and/or instructional materials were provided to each pupil for visual
 
and performing arts.*Please note: In 
reference to materials not from a most recent State Board Adoption (SBE): In November 2017, the California State Board of Edu
cation approved a list of 
History/Social Science programs for districts to consider for their
 
new adoption. CVUSD elected to continue to use current District adopted materials 
while further studying program options provided on the SBE list to consider for a future piloting process. CVUSD reviewed cur
rent District adopted 
materials and determined t
hat they meet current history/social science standards.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Chino Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) makes it a priority to maintain safe, clean, and effective school sites for our 
students, staff, and parents. The 
safety of students is of paramount importance to CVUSD. I
n the morning, staff supervision is provided to watch the cafeteria, entrance gates, and 
playground activities. During lunch and recess times, noon ground supervisors and teachers monitor students to ensure student
s interact safely. At the 
end of the schoo
l day, staff supervises student dismissal. The staff and student workspaces for this site are cleaned on a regular basis by t
he school site 
custodial staff. In addition to regular cleanings, deep cleanings are scheduled and carried out during breaks and va
cation periods. The school facility is 
adequate and has sufficient classrooms, playgrounds, and staff spaces in order to operate efficiently. A recently completed s
chool improvement for this 
site was the schoolwide security camera and keyless access system
 
planned for the 2020/2021 school year.

To ensure sites are clean, safe and functional, Maintenance and Operations department staff conduct inspections at the school
 
sites on a continual basis. 
School sites may also enter maintenance requests by accessing
 
the School Dude system. After the school site request is entered into the system, a work 
order is generated, and the Maintenance staff works diligently to complete all work orders in a timely manner.  The Maintenan
ce team utilized the Facility 
Inspection 
Tool (FIT), a survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction (OPSC), to record i
nspection results.

completed on or before December 30, 2019.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarte
r Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible s
tudents 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

State 
Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each scho
ol site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Newman has an active parent group. From volunteering in classrooms to participating in fund
-
raisers, field trips, and taking part in goal
-
setting for the 
school, parents play a vital rol
e in the overall success of students at Newman Elementary. Parent organizations, such as the Parent
-
Faculty Association, 
School Site Council, English Learners Advisory Council, and Parent Classes and Meetings all contribute scores of volunteers a
nd hundred
s of hours of time 
in helping create a true community school.
 
 
These committees exist to provide opportunities for school representatives and parents to work together to improve the school

In addition, Newman has several partnerships
 
with the City of Chino and San Bernardino County to provide student support services, recreation, and 
enrichment programs: High Five, Safe School Ambassadors, Green Team (Recycling and Conservation), Fun Club, Character Develop
ment, Chino Youth 
Counseling
 
Services, the Running Club, and the State Preschool Program. Together, they enhance the learning environment and educational 
programs at 
Newman.
 
 

ies; as well as bring the community together 
for activities such as the Friday Flag Salutes, Career Day, and the Science Fair Competition. Moreover, Newman Elementary enc
ourages parent 
involvement through attendance at the District Community Forums and mem
bership in DELAC (District English Learners Advisory Council). Finally, with 
programs such as the Accelerated Reader, AVID and Irvine Math Project, parents are asked to engage with their children and en
courage their children to 
be successful students.

School Safety Plan
 
Each school has a detailed School Site Safety Plan for emergencies that is annually reviewed, updated, and discussed by the S
chool Site Council. The date 
on which the School Site Safety Plan was last annually reviewed was March 2019, and the plans are revi
ewed monthly by the School Site Council.  Each 

onents and procedures. 
Fire, earthquake, and intruder drills are held on a regular b
asis so that all students and staff are familiar with emergency procedures. Emergency supplies 
are located on each campus in the event of an emergency.
 
 
Assigned staff monitors school grounds daily before, during, and after school.  The District policy reg
arding campus visitors is enforced by requiring 

-
in log is located in the school office and all visitors must sign in before 
going onto the campus. In addition, all visit
ors must wear an identifying badge while on campus. To increase security, all gates remain locked during the 
school day, so visitors must enter campus through the school office.
 
 
The Chino Valley Unified School District is committed to providing an environ
ment that fosters health and safety, in both form and function. This 
commitment extends to the process of developing and maintaining a comprehensive Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan as a
 

Safe Schools Plan and is evident from 
the individual site to the overall District. These plans delineate actions to protect all students while they are at 
school. The plans are designed with the help of security staff members, local law enforcement, local fire, and emergency mana
gement, and pu
blic health 
officials as required by Education Code 32280
-
32282.
 
 
Plans are reviewed and updated yearly in accordance with Education Code 32286. These plans include procedures to respond to c
ritical incidents, such 
as fire, earthquake, or intruders. School
 
personnel practice these drills regularly.
 
 
The primary purpose of the Chino Valley Unified School District Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan is to define roles a
nd responsibilities at the 
site and between the site and district office management. T
he Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan establishes the minimum requirements for 
school and site plans throughout the District. This Plan meets the requirements of the Standardized Emergency Management Syst
em (SEMS) as mandated 
by California Code of Re
gulations, Sections 2400
-
2450, and the National Incident Management System (NIMS) as mandated by Government Code 8607. 
It also meets the requirements for earthquake preparedness found in Title 5 (California State Education Code, Sections 35295
-
35297).
