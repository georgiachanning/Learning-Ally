By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-

MISSION STATEMENT
 
"Effort Equals Success" is the message our students live by at Banyan. Students strive to do their best in academics, 
citizenship, technology, and the arts.
 
The Banyan 
staff view their mission as "Building the Future Through Personal Growth and Academic Success".
 
 
SCHOOL DESCRIPTION
 
Banyan Elementary School is entering its 53rd year as a choice destination for elementary education in Newbury Park, CA.  
We pride ourselves
 
on being a community based school that has wonderful parent and local business support.  The Banyan 
staff is committed to helping each child reach their potential. Our goals align with district LCAP goals and the spirit of th
e 
Every Student Succeeds Act. 
  
We believe that all students are capable of personal growth as evidenced by their academic 
success. Students strive to grow in academics, citizenship, technology, and the arts. We make student centered decisions 
that empower each learner to be successful
.  Together we work to empower students to be Bobcats who ROAR; are 
Respectful, have Outstanding attitudes, are Always safe, and Responsible.
 
 
Banyan Elementary School is nestled in a charming residential neighborhood, with stunning views of Mt. Boney and 
in 
close proximity to national park lands. The school is the center of this neighborhood and a focus of the people who live 
here. Children at Banyan receive a rich academic and social education delivered by highly skilled teachers and staff who 
are greatly
 
supported by administration, parents, and community members. One only needs to look at the front of our 
school, for a shining example of what makes Banyan great
--
 
our front landscaping that is a native California garden 
completely paid for, planted, and m
aintained by Banyan alumna and their parents. Banyan students are building strong 
academic skills and are developing relationships in a culturally, linguistically, and socioeconomically diverse environment. 
The school is home to about 450 kindergarten
-
5th 
grade students, 20 general education teachers, 1 special education 
teacher, and a team of classified staff members and specialists. Our faculty and staff work together to make sure every 
student can achieve.
 
 
In addition to meeting district and state stand
ards, Banyan's academic programs are enriched by the joint efforts of our 
School Site Council, ELAC, and PTA.  Our School Site Council oversees budgets and works in tandem with the principal and 
PTA to provide support to our faculty, staff, and students. T
hrough the site budget, and supplemented by PTA funds, 
specialists are hired to support our intervention, PE, STEM, and art programs.  Our PAWS (Practice & Achieve with Support) 
program is designed to target the academic need of all levels of learners.  We
 
also have a school wide focus to use UDL 
practices to remove barriers for all learners. In order to enrich our academic programs, Banyan continues to be progressive 
in the area of technology. We created and maintain a state of the art STEM lab, called See
lig Space (after a beloved senior 
volunteer).  We have a variety of technologies and platforms available to expose children to tools that make learning more 
relevant to them.  Our upper grade classes are one
-
to
-
one having a Chromebook available for all lea
rners. We also 
maintain a myriad of web based software programs to assist in both intervention and enrichment both at school and at 
home.

Banyan Elementary is a family to all of those fortunate enough to work or learn here. Our PTA works diligently to ensure 
that our students are provided with outstanding programs that enrich education.  They hold two fundraisers throughout 
the year to fund 
our art, music, and physical education programs. In addition, PTA provides an assortment of professionally 
presented enrichment assemblies for our children. Additionally they fund programs such as family art and science nights 
that compliment the curriculu
m at school.  We make community outreach a priority.  The principal sends an email home 
every Sunday informing parents of all events and happenings at the school.  We also have a monthly newsletter, Cat Tales, 
which has a more extensive look at what is hap
pening.  PTA sends text messages using remind, and e
-
mail blasts as well. 
Finally, the principal is an avid tweeter
--
 
making sure all of the amazing things that our students do are available for parents 
to view online. We also maintain a school website wit
h great information on it for our families. Parents are encouraged to 
be as involved in school as their schedule allows
--
 
with opportunities to serve on committees, represent us at district DAC 
committees, volunteering in their child's class, or donating i
tems for special events. We maintain two alternative recess 
environments that help provide options for students which assists us on meeting diverse social emotional needs; the 
aforementioned maker space and our critically acclaimed Club 8 art room. Club 8 
provides a linguistically diverse room for 
students to work on their fine art skills. Our bilingual facilitator and paraprofessional run this space, helping our bilingu
al 
newcomers find a safe space to practice their newly developed English skills.
 
 
We are
 
incredibly proud of our school and invite you to see the magic first hand by visiting, volunteering, or following us 
on social media!

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
January 2020
 
 
All TK
-
12 students have 
current standards
-
based textbooks in math, science, history/social science, and English/language 
arts. With each curricular cycle established by the State of California, the Conejo Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) 
Board of Education adopts textbooks 
within the timeline provided. Standards
-
aligned books for grades 9
-
12 are approved 
locally. Textbooks in grades K
-
8 are selected from lists of books and materials approved by the State Board of Education. 
Sufficient standards
-
based textbooks and instructio
nal materials have been purchased for all students in English, math, 
history/social science, science, health and foreign language. In addition, annually, sites receive specific science 
supplementary funds to be used for consumable laboratory expenses and/o
r equipment.
 
 
The process of selecting textbooks and materials involves the formation of a committee charged with the responsibility of 
reviewing current state standards and frameworks, analyzing student data, writing courses of study (as required) and 
sel
ecting and maintaining current instructional materials. The goal of such district
-
wide committees comprised of teachers 
and administrators representing all targeted grade levels, is to achieve high academic standards for all of our TK
-
12 
students. Each maj
or subject area, such as math, science, history/social science, foreign language and English/language 
arts, is reviewed and adopted under the guidance of the California Department of Education and State Board of Education. 
The committee submits its recomme
ndations to the Board of Education for final approval. The recommendation to the 
Board includes the basic textbook materials as well as supplementary materials within the subject. On October 1, 2019, 
the CVUSD Board of Education approved a resolution for t
he 2019
-
2020 school year declaring that the Conejo Valley 
Unified School District has provided each pupil with sufficient standards
-
based textbooks and instructional materials 
consistent with the cycles and content of the curriculum frameworks.

School District:  Sit
e Administrator, Director of Maintenance and Operations, Director of Planning and New Construction, 
and the Assistant Superintendent.  A facilities evaluation is completed documenting the condition of the school in a variety 
of areas including the cleanlin
ess of restrooms, condition of roofs, paving and walkways, HVAC systems, landscape 
maintenance, etc.  Any observed condition that represents a threat to the health and safety of students and staff is

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Banyan Elementary has a supportive school community and PTA that work diligently to ensure that our children have 
outstanding programs to enrich their education. They hold several fundraisers during the year to fund our Art, Music, and 
Physical Education p
rograms. In addition, the PTA provides an assortment of professionally presented enrichment 
assemblies for our children. There are many opportunities for parent involvement. Parents participate in organized 
committees such as the PTA, ELAC, Community Outre
ach, and School Site Council. Parent volunteers assist in classrooms, 
work in the library, provide enrichment lessons in art, act as coaches in the Odyssey of the Mind program, assist with 
organizing our Lunch Bunch events for our GATE students, and partic
ipate in a variety of activities offered throughout the 
year. The countless hours of volunteer time illustrate our partnership between school and community.  We have a strong 
communication system that includes Banyan's marquee, our weekly principal email, 
a monthly calendar, Eblast, Twitter, 
and school website and our Parent Link call/email system.  In addition, our PTA's communication board, Facebook page, 
Twitter, and school website keeps parents informed about many of the activities we offer.  Our school
 
community 
participates in weekly Bobcat assemblies, monthly restaurant night fundraisers, activities, and school improvement 
projects. If you would like more information about Banyan Elementary, please contact Allison Kennedy, Principal at (805)
