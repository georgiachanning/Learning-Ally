School Description
 
Our balanced, comprehensive, success oriented program addresses all 
aspects of the elementary 
school student. Parents and teachers are partners in providing opportunities for their 
children/pupils to achieve a personal best. Students are encouraged to develop a vision of 
excellence for their future, while learning to accep
t responsibility for their actions and 
achievement.  The following is our Mission Statement:
 
 
Every decision we make is to ensure the success of our students.  We will provide a safe and 
supportive environment where students can thrive by using differentia
ted strategies to help them 
achieve their learning and social
-
emotional goals to prepare them to be college and career ready.
 
 
Student expectations are well defined and modeled. Ramona uses Positive Behavior Intervention 
Supports program.  Our school expec
tations are:  Be Safe, Be Respectful, and Be Responsible.  
Ramona teachers have become well versed in the new California Common Core State Standards.  
They have attended Benchmark, Eureka, Guided Reading, PBIS and AVID professional development 
opportunitie
s.  Instruction is designed to address standards in order for all students to achieve 
proficiency.
 
 
Working together with our community, Ramona Elementary School strives for academic 
achievement and the establishment of a creative learning 
environment that effectively serves a 
diverse population of students. Using available resources, standards
-
based instruction, data 
analysis of student work, and differentiated school day intervention programs, all students will 
demonstrate achievement at o
r above the proficient level in the core areas in alignment with the 
California Common Core.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructi
onal Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
A District committee considers textbooks for recommendation on a cycle established by the State Board of Education and from a
 
State adopted list.  The 
committee meets to discuss current issues relevant to the subject ma
tter, including student success, previously used textbooks, and instructional 
methods.  The committee reviews demonstration copies of proposed textbooks, as well as listen to representatives describe the
 
various highlights of the 
available materials.  The 
review is followed by a pilot of materials that results in consensus by the committee of a recommended textbook.  The textboo
k 
is forwarded to a K
-
12 Curriculum Council, which consists of teachers, parents, and community stakeholders, for review and approv
al.  If the textbook is 
approved by the K
-
12 Curriculum Council, the textbook is forwarded to the Superintendent and the Governing Board for their review and approval.
  
Each 
pupil in the district, including English learners, kindergarten through grade twel
ve, is provided with standards
-
aligned textbooks or basic instructional 
materials that are consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framework adopted by the State Board.
 
 
AB 1246, added Education Code Section 60210, which allows the distric
t to use any instructional materials, not just state
-
adopted, as long as they are 
aligned with the academic content standards.  The EC 60119 has a new section (e) with a reference to the Common Core State St
andards (CCSS).  The 

rpose of transitioning to instructional materials that are aligned with the common core academic content standards, it is the
 
intent of the Legislature that textbooks, instructional materials, and supplemental instructional materials be deemed to be a
ligne
d with the content 
standards pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (c), and be deemed consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framew
ork adopted by the state 
board pursuant to subdivision (a) if the textbooks, instructional materials, supplement
al instructional materials, or a combination of any such materials 

ed to either the 1997 
standards or the 2010 CCSS standards for m
athematics and English Language Arts are compliant with Williams Act requirements.  In accordance with 
Education Code Section 60422(a) and 60119, the Governing Board certified on September 3, 2019 that each pupil in the district
, including English learners
, 
in kindergarten through grade twelve, has been provided with standards
-
aligned textbooks or basic instructional materials in each of the areas listed

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Ramona Elementary School opened its doors in the fall of 1963. Ramona Elementary School currently contains 22 permanent class
rooms and 18 
relocatable classrooms. School cleanliness is a
 
priority.  The custodian takes great care to thoroughly clean and make small repairs to the school campus 
daily.  Ramona is contained within  fencing on all four sides.   Any visitors to the campus must check in through the office 
and provide picture iden
tification 
which is then scanned into Lobby Guard.  During the 2013 summer, the library received new carpeting and was repainted.  Minor
 
remodeling was 
completed to provide a more spacious environment for the students.  Every classroom has adequate space a
nd all the materials needed to ensure student 
success.
