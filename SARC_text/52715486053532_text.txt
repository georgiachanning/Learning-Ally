Description
 
The
 
mission
 
of
 
Gerber
 
Elementary
 
School
 
is
 
to
 
team
 
with
 
families
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
college-oriented
 
culture
 
where
 
students
 
are
 
safe,
 
respected,
 
and
 
empowered
 
to
 
contribute
 
in
 
a
 
global
 
community.
  
Our
 
vision
 
statement
 
is
 
"Inspiring
 
students
 
to
 
dream
 
big..."
 
and
 
our
 
motto
 
is
 
"Work
 
Hard,
 
Dream
 
Big!".
 
 
It
 
is
 
our
 
belief
 
that
 
knowledge
 
is
 
power
 
and
 
that
 
our
 
students
 
will
 
have
 
greater
 
opportunities
 
in
 
life
 
if
 
they
 
attend
 
college.
 
We
 
are
 
a
 
proud
 
member
 
of
 
the
 
No
 
Excuses
 
University
 
network
 
that
 
promotes
 
college
 
and
 
career
 
readiness
 
and
 
is
 
built
 
around
 
six
 
systems
 
that
 
lead
 
to
 
student
 
success.
 
The
 
six
 
systems
 
are:
 
creating
 
a
 
culture
 
of
 
universal
 
achievement,
 
collaboration,
 
standards
 
alignment,
 
assessment,
 
data
 
management,
 
and
 
interventions.
  
We
 
portray
 
powerful
 
college
 
symbolism
 
in
 
classrooms
 
and
 
around
 
the
 
school.
  
Examples
 
of
 
this
 
symbolism
 
include:
 
each
 
classroom
 
has
 
adopted
 
a
 
university
 
to
 
represent;
 
university
 
flags
 
hang
 
proudly
 
in
 
our
 
classrooms
 
and
 
main
 
hallway;
 
some
 
teachers
 
have
 
painted
 
their
 
university
 
emblem
 
on
 
the
 
outside
 
of
 
their
 
classroom
 
doors;
 
and
 
the
 
staff
 
and
 
students
 
wear
 
NEU
 
shirts
 
on
 
Mondays,
 
college
 
shirts
 
on
 
Wednesdays,
 
and
 
school
 
colors
 
on
 
Fridays.
 
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
strong
 
sense
 
of
 
Gerber
 
Pride
 
on
 
our
 
campus.
  
Our
 
school
 
culture
 
centers
 
on
 
building
 
student
 
character
 
and
 
self-esteem,
 
while
 
setting
 
high
 
expectations
 
for
 
future
 
success.
 
To
 
better
 
serve
 
the
 
diverse
 
needs
 
of
 
all
 
learners,
 
we
 
are
 
implementing
 
a
 
Multi-Tiered
 
System
 
of
 
Supports
 
(MTSS)
 
schoolwide.
  
This
 
system
 
allows
 
us
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
educating
 
the
 
whole
 
child
 
and
 
blend
 
services
 
to
 
support
 
academics
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
behavior
 
and
 
social/emotional
 
needs.
 
 
We
 
have
 
implemented
 
the
 
California
 
Common
 
Core
 
State
 
Standards
 
(CCSS)
 
at
 
every
 
grade
 
level
 
and
 
test
 
our
 
3-8
 
grade
 
students
 
using
 
the
 
California
 
Assessment
 
of
 
Student
 
Performance
 
and
 
Progress
 
(CAASPP)
 
each
 
spring.
  
We
 
consulted
 
with
 
stakeholders
 
to
 
create
 
our
 
Local
 
Control
 
Accountability
 
Plan
 
(LCAP)
 
and
 
have
 
made
 
it
 
a
 
priority
 
to
 
align
 
our
 
programs
 
with
 
21st
 
Century
 
Learning.
 
 
The
 
school
 
uses
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
methods
 
to
 
evaluate
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
its
 
overall
 
program
 
each
 
year.
  
Stakeholders
 
are
 
involved
 
in
 
the
 
evaluation
 
process
 
through
 
School
 
Site
 
Council
 
(SSC)
 
and
 
the
 
District
 
English
 
Language
 
Acquisition
 
Committee
 
(ELAC/DELAC).
  
Results
 
of
 
this
 
process
 
are
 
communicated
 
to
 
all
 
segments
 
of
 
the
 
school
 
community
 
in
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
ways,
 
including
 
the
 
School
 
Accountability
 
Report
 
Card
 
(SARC)
 
and
 
student
 
report
 
cards.
 
 
Gerber
 
Union
 
Elementary
 
School
 
serves
 
approximately
 
400
 
students
 
in
 
grades
 
TK-8.
  
A
 
state
 
funded
 
pre-school
 
is
 
located
 
on
 
campus
 
which
 
feeds
 
into
 
the
 
Gerber
 
School
 
population.
  
The
 
Gerber
 
School
 
District
 
was
 
built
 
in
 
1954
 
and
 
is
 
characterized
 
as
 
a
 
rural
 
unincorporated
 
area
 
of
 
approximately
 
70
 
square
 
miles
 
in
 
the
 
center
 
of
 
Tehama
 
County.
  
It
 
is
 
one
 
of
 
14
 
small
 
school
 
districts
 
within
 
the
 
county
 
and
 
is
 
a
 
feeder
 
school
 
for
 
Red
 
Bluff
 
High
 
School
 
District.
 
 
The
 
number
 
of
 
English
 
Learners
 
(EL),
 
limited
 
or
 
non-English
 
speaking
 
students,
 
in
 
the
 
school
 
has
 
grown
 
at
 
a
 
faster
 
pace
 
than
 
the
 
general
 
population.
  
Close
 
to
 
50%
 
of
 
the
 
overall
 
student
 
population
 
are
 
EL
 
students.
  
Approximately
 
86%
 
of
 
the
 
student
 
body
 
qualifies
 
for
 
either
 
free
 
or
 
reduced
 
priced
 
lunches.
 
 
 
About
 
the
 
SARC
 
By
 
February
 
1
 
of
 
each
 
year,
 
every
 
school
 
in
 
California
 
is
 
required
 
by
 
state
 
law
 
to
 
publish
 
a
 
School
 
Accountability
 
Report
 
Card
 
(SARC).
 
The
 
SARC
 
contains
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
condition
 
and
 
performance
 
of
 
each
 
California
 
public
 
school.
 
Under
 
the
 
Local
 
Control
 
Funding
 
Formula
 
(LCFF)
 
all
 
local
 
educational
 
agencies
 
(LEAs)
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
prepare
 
a
 
Local
 
Control
 
and
 
Accountability
 
Plan
 
(LCAP),
 
which
 
describes
 
how
 
they
 
intend
 
to
 
meet
 
annual
 
school-specific
 
goals
 
for
 
all
 
pupils,
 
with
 
specific
 
activities
 
to
 
address
 
state
 
and
 
local
 
priorities.
 
Additionally,
 
data
 
reported
 
in
 
an
 
LCAP
 
is
 
to
 
be
 
consistent
 
with
 
data
 
reported
 
in
 
the
 
SARC.

Gerber
 
School
 
is
 
currently
 
in
 
line
 
for
 
state
 
aid
 
and
 
hardship
 
funding
 
to
 
support
 
a
 
modernization
 
project
 
on
 
site.
 
We
 
will
 
also
 
be
 
going
 
out
 
for
 
a
 
bond
 
during
 
the
 
March
 
2020
 
Primary
 
Election
 
to
 
help
 
generate
 
additional
 
funding
 
for
 
safety
 
upgrades.
 
Our
 
main
 
focus
 
for
 
renovations
 
will
 
be
 
updating
 
our
 
aging
 
portables,
 
reconfiguring
 
our
 
parking
 
lot
 
to
 
allow
 
safer
 
drop-off
 
and
 
pick-up
 
zones,
 
and
 
redesign
 
the
 
front
 
of
 
the
 
school
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
single
 
point
 
of
 
entry.
 
 
Gerber
 
Elementary
 
School
 
was
 
originally
 
constructed
 
in
 
1954.
  
Since
 
that
 
time,
 
additional
 
classrooms
 
have
 
been
 
added.
 
The
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
school
 
was
 
modernized
 
in
 
the
 
early
 
1990s.
  
The
 
entire
 
school
 
was
 
repainted
 
in
 
the
 
summer
 
of
 
2003.
  
The
 
playground
 
was
 
repaved
 
in
 
2004.
  
In
 
2006
 
the
 
school
 
was
 
awarded
 
a
 
2.5
 
million
 
dollar
 
modernization
 
grant
 
to
 
address
 
fire/safety
 
and
 
ADA
 
needs.
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
extensive
 
ADA
 
modernization
 
work,
 
the
 
school's
 
exterior
 
was
 
completely
 
painted,
 
new
 
cafeteria
 
floor,
 
new
 
ansul
 
system
 
in
 
kitchen,
 
front
 
landscaping,
 
interior
 
classroom
 
painting,
 
new
 
HVAC
 
units
 
on
 
regular
 
construction
 
classrooms,
 
office
 
and
 
cafeteria,
 
and
 
safety
 
door
 
handles
 
were
 
added
 
on
 
all
 
doors.
  
New
 
carpet
 
is
 
replaced
 
in
 
classrooms
 
as
 
needed.
  
In
 
the
 
summer
 
of
 
2014,
 
the
 
computer
 
lab
 
was
 
completely
 
remodeled.
  
In
 
2015,
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
lighting
 
was
 
replaced
 
with
 
LED
 
lights
 
and
 
the
 
roof
 
on
 
the
 
Multi-
Purpose
 
Room
 
(MPR)
 
was
 
replaced.
  
Roofs
 
and
 
portable
 
buildings
 
have
 
been
 
repaired
 
and
 
replaced
 
as
 
necessary.
 
 
The
 
capacity
 
of
 
the
 
existing
 
school
 
is
 
537
 
students.
 
This
 
includes
 
using
 
many
 
portable
 
classrooms.
 
The
 
school
 
staff
 
works
 
hard
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
buildings,
 
grounds,
 
and
 
restrooms
 
are
 
safe
 
and
 
clean.
 
Students
 
are
 
responsible
 
for
 
helping
 
to
 
ensure
 
a
 
clean,
 
safe,
 
school
 
facility.
 
 
All
 
classrooms
 
are
 
Internet
 
accessible,
 
with
 
updated
 
computers
 
available
 
for
 
student
 
use.
 
All
 
students
 
in
 
grades
 
1-8
 
have
 
1:1
 
chromebooks
 
and
 
our
 
computer
 
lab
 
is
 
used
 
as
 
a
 
Makerspace.
 
The
 
library
 
exceeds
 
the

Gerber
 
Elementary
 
School
 
believes
 
student
 
success
 
depends
 
on
 
parents
 
and
 
schools
 
working
 
together.
 
We
 
actively
 
seek
 
parent
 
involvement
 
in
 
our
 
students'
 
education.
 
We
 
have
 
adopted
 
a
 
Parent
 
Involvement
 
Policy
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
located
 
in
 
the
 
front
 
office.
 
Parents
 
are
 
invited
 
to
 
participate
 
at
 
all
 
levels,
 
from
 
helping
 
in
 
their
 
child's
 
classrooms,
 
to
 
getting
 
involved
 
in
 
the
 
Parents'
 
Club,
 
or
 
even
 
serving
 
on
 
advisory
 
committees;
 
such
 
as,
 
SSC
 
and
 
ELAC/DELAC.
 
The
 
Parents'
 
Club,
 
SSC,
 
and
 
ELAC/DELAC
 
meet
 
regularly
 
and
 
make
 
recommendations
 
to
 
benefit
 
our
 
students
 
and
 
school.
 
The
 
advisory
 
committees
 
give
 
input
 
to,
 
and
 
help
 
identify
 
goals
 
for,
 
the
 
Local
 
Control
 
Accountability
 
Report
 
Card
 
(LCAP).
 
We
 
make
 
every
 
effort
 
to
 
keep
 
parents
 
informed
 
about
 
what
 
is
 
happening
 
at
 
school.
 
Communication
 
is
 
offered
 
in
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
ways;
 
such
 
as:
 
newsletters,
 
website,
 
conferences,
 
and
 
phone
 
notification
 
system.
 
Each
 
parent
 
receives
 
four
 
handbooks
 
at
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
the
 
year:
 
1)
 
The
 
Common
 
Core

handbook,
 
which
 
explains

2)

3)

that
 
explains

about
 
our

programs
 
along
 
with

rules
 
and

School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
Gerber
 
Elementary
 
School
 
has
 
in
 
place
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
to
 
serve
 
as
 
a
 
school
 
guide
 
for
 
handling
 
critical
 
incidents;
 
such
 
as,
 
code
 
red,
 
fire,
 
earthquakes,
 
hazardous
 
materials,
 
or
 
other
 
disasters
 
and
 
emergencies.
 
The
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
is
 
available
 
for
 
review
 
in
 
the
 
main
 
office.
 
The
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
was
 
reviewed
 
with
 
staff
 
in
 
August
 
2019
 
then
 
updated
 
and
 
approval
 
by
 
SSC
 
and
 
the
 
board
 
in
 
November.
  
The
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
examines
 
the
 
issue
 
of
 
safety
 
on
 
our
 
school
 
campus
 
and
 
recommends
 
strategies
 
and
 
actions
 
for
 
the
 
school's
 
physical
 
environment
 
while
 
building
 
a
 
positive
 
school
 
culture
 
that
 
is
 
engaging
 
and
 
promotes
 
supporting
 
the
 
whole
 
child.
  
The
 
District
 
uses
 
the
 
CatapultEMS
 
Emergency
 
Management
 
System
 
to
 
enhance
 
the
 
safety
 
of
 
students
 
and
 
staff
 
through
 
real-time
 
communication
 
and
 
information
 
management.
 
 
The
 
plan
 
identifies
 
designated
 
members
 
of
 
the
 
Crisis
 
Response
 
Team
 
(CRT)
 
and
 
their
 
specific
 
jobs
 
and
 
responsibilities.
 
Students
 
take
 
part
 
in
 
regularly
 
scheduled
 
code
 
red,
 
fire,
 
earthquake
 
and
 
other
 
drills.
  
During
 
the
 
month
 
of
 
September
 
the
 
school
 
participated
 
in
 
a
 
'Safety
 
Week'
 
where
 
all
 
drills
 
will
 
be
 
reviewed
 
and
 
practiced.
 
 
All
 
staff
 
members
 
have
 
been
 
issued
 
identification
 
badges,
 
and
 
visitors
 
must
 
sign
 
in
 
at
 
the
 
office
 
and
 
wear
 
visitor
 
badges
 
for
 
proper
 
identification.
 
 
District
 
Nurse:
 
The
 
Gerber
 
Union
 
Elementary
 
School
 
District
 
nurse
 
is
 
on
 
site
 
on
 
a
 
weekly
 
basis.
 
However,
 
a
 
nurse
 
is
 
available
 
to
 
assist
 
if
 
the
 
need
 
arises.
 
The
 
nurse
 
gives
 
State-mandated
 
dental,
 
vision,
 
and
 
hearing
 
tests,
 
and
 
notifies
 
parents
 
if
 
a
 
concern
 
about
 
a
 
student's
 
health
 
arises.
 
First
 
Aid
 
&
 
Emergency
 
Forms:
 
First
 
aid,
 
defined
 
as
 
the
 
immediate,
 
temporary
 
care
 
given
 
in
 
case
 
of
 
accident
 
or
 
sudden
 
illness,
 
will
 
be
 
given
 
when
 
necessary.
 
First
 
aid
 
will
 
be
 
rendered
 
by
 
anyone
 
qualified
 
to
 
do
 
so.
 
In
 
case
 
of
 
an
 
accident
 
requiring
 
the
 
services
 
of
 
a
 
doctor,
 
every
 
attempt
 
is
 
made
 
to
 
contact
 
the
 
parent
 
or
 
guardian
 
before
 
the
 
child
 
is
 
taken
 
to
 
the
 
hospital.
 
Emergency
 
treatment
 
cannot
 
be
 
administered
 
unless
 
a
 
signed
 
form
 
is
 
on
 
file.
 
For
 
this
 
reason,
 
parents
 
should
 
inform
 
the
 
school
 
immediately
 
of
 
any
 
changes
 
in
 
address
 
or
 
telephone
 
numbers.
 
Emergency
 
information
 
is
 
communicated
 
to
 
emergency
 
personnel.
 
 
Administration
 
of
 
Medication
 
Policy:
 
To
 
conform
 
with
 
the
 
California
 
Education
 
Code
 
#49423,
 
the
 
Gerber
 
Union
 
Elementary
 
School
 
District
 
has
 
adopted
 
the
 
following
 
policy:
 
any
 
pupil
 
who
 
is
 
required
 
to
 
take,
 
during
 
the
 
regular
 
school
 
day,
 
medication
 
prescribed
 
for
 
him/her
 
by
 
a
 
physician,
 
may
 
be
 
assisted
 
by
 
the
 
school
 
nurse
 
or
 
other
 
designated
 
school
 
personnel
 
if
 
the
 
school
 
district
 
has
 
received,
 
(1)
 
a
 
written
 
statement
 
from
 
such
 
physician
 
detailing
 
the
 
method,
 
amount,
 
and
 
time
 
schedule
 
by
 
which
 
medication
 
is
 
to
 
be
 
taken;
 
and
 
(2)
 
a
 
written
 
statement
 
from
 
the
 
parent
 
or
 
guardian
 
of
 
the
 
pupil
 
indicating
 
the
 
desire
 
that
 
the
 
school
 
district
 
assist
 
the
 
pupil
 
in
 
the
 
matter
 
set
 
forth
 
in
 
the
 
physicians
 
statement.
 
Only
 
medications
 
prescribed

a
 
physician,
 
accompanied
 
by
 
parent
 
or
 
guardian's
 
signed
 
Request
 
for
 
Medication
 
form
 
will
 
be
 
administered.
 
The
 
medication
 
must
 
be
 
brought
 
to
 
the
 
Office
 
Clerk
 
in
 
the
 
original
 
container.
 
If
 
the
 
child
 
needs
 
over-the-counter
 
medication,
 
inhalants,
 
etc.,
 
the
 
child
 
must
 
follow
 
the
 
same
 
procedure
 
as
 
for
 
prescribed
 
medication.
 
Students
 
are
 
not
 
allowed
 
to
 
carry
 
prescription
 
or
 
non-prescription
 
medications
 
on
 
their

Funded
 
To
 
increase
 
student
 
achievement
 
that
 
focuses
 
on
 
the
 
whole
 
child,
 
Gerber
 
School
 
has
 
set
 
priorities
 
to
 
implement
 
a
 
Multi-Tiered
 
System
 
of
 
Supports
 
(MTSS).
  
On
 
the
 
academic
 
side,
 
we
 
have
 
staffed
 
an
 
Intervention
 
Coordinator,
 
Response
 
to
 
Intervention
 
(RTI)
 
teacher,
 
English
 
Language
 
Development
 
(ELD)
 
teacher,
 
2
 
Education
 
Specialists
 
(RSP)
 
and
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
instructional
 
assistants.
  
On
 
the
 
behavior/social-emotional
 
side
 
of
 
MTSS,
 
we
 
have
 
staffed
 
a
 
Behavior
 
Intervention
 
Coordinator,
 
psychologist,
 
and
 
counselor.
  
The
 
teams
 
on
 
these
 
two
 
sides
 
of
 
MTSS
 
meet
 
weekly
 
and
 
use
 
data
 
to
 
identify
 
students
 
that
 
are
 
struggling
 
then
 
match
 
interventions
 
to
 
support
 
students'
 
needs.
  
Our
 
model
 
of
 
support
 
for
 
students
 
and
 
teachers
 
is
 
blended
 
with
 
push-in
 
and
 
pull-out
 
services.
  
Our
 
support
 
staff
 
are
 
also
 
available
 
for
 
coaching
 
and
 
mentoring.
 
 
Aligned
 
to
 
MTSS,
 
we
 
are
 
also
 
implementing
 
Positive
 
Behavior
 
Intervention
 
Supports
 
(PBIS)
 
and
 
the
 
Nurtured
 
Heart
 
Approach
 
(NHA).
