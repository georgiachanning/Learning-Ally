By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

wide program for the instructional support of all 
students primarily students with needs. The school contains a variety of instructional programs to meet the varied needs 
of our students included gifted students, English Learn
ers, and students receiving Special Education instruction. Jane 
Addams is one of eight schools in the Lawndale Elementary School District, and one of two middle schools serving students 
in grades 6
-

Jane Addams is an ethnically diverse school of 845 students. According the CBEDS 2017 eighty
-
one percent (80%) of our 
students are Hispanic, twenty four percent (19%) are English Learners, eighty

Resource Teacher (ELIRT) and a math TOSA that is split with the other middle school to provide teachers the resources to 
deliver best first instruction to students on a daily basis. In addition to that there is a 21 century
 
instructional resource 
teacher, a social worker, computer technician and a library media teacher. The Title I funds are allocated toward 
interventions. In addition to having a Language Arts Specialist, there are two five hour instructional assistants. The
 
instructional assistants support our ELIRT and LAS directly servicing struggling students. Students at Addams also receive 
intervention in the areas of Language Arts and Math before and after school. Students are selected using grade level 
universal scree

environments, and English Language Development. Technical as

budget, data analysis, and computer technology . The SBAC testing is now in full implementation and will be given in the 
Spring.The CELDT is given annually, and initially for students new to a California

The staff, students, and community are dedicated to ensure that a high level of expectation of academic excellence is 
maintained for all our students.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress 
[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or
 
programs 
of study.

The LESD Education Services team in collaboration with the Language Arts Specialists, English Language Instructional 
Resource Teachers, and Principals have designed a 
comprehensive system for monthly professional development.  All 
district professional development occurs on Thursdays after school following an early release day.   Topics are selected 
based on expressed teacher need and identified student deficiencies.  A
ll professional development in the LESD focuses 
on meaningful collaboration, developing teacher capacity and the implementation of research based practices to support 
student achievement. The most prominent initiative we are focused on for professional dev
elopment is deepening student 
learning and critical thinking with purposeful questioning and academic discourse. This school year we have added Social 
Emotional Learning as our Professional Development focus to improve outcomes for students that have exper
ienced 
trauma and how the staff can create, facilitate, cultivate, and maintain positive relationships with students.
 
 
Teachers receive professional development in structured cycles that afford them the opportunity to learn about a new 
concept, plan for im
plementation with their colleagues, practice their learning with students, and then come back with 
their colleagues to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of their instructional implementation of the new skill.
 
 
Feedback about the effectiveness of the pro
fessional development is regularly collected to assess the effectiveness of the 
program and make changes as needed.  Additionally, site staff members and Educational Services team members regularly 
visit classrooms to determine the level of implementation 
of the professional development focus.
