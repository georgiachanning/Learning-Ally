Grant School engages in the ongoing formal and informal assessments of our students' academic abilities and routinely evaluat
es staff, 
programs,
 
opportunities for community involvement, and school climate in areas such as school connectedness and bullying. All of these 
actions are critical to our students' success. The goals are part of a shared vision where students will be prepared to read 
and w
rite, think 
and collaborate, speak and listen, compute and problem
-
solve. All stakeholders in the Grant School community work to combine the 
school's diversity, resources, positive energy, and talents and skills of its parent/guardian population to create 
a learning environment 
that fosters critical thinkers, caring citizens, and academically competitive students. This year, Grant School has engaged i
n the Deep 
Learning Global Network philosophy of education. This shift in teaching and learning pedagogy ena
bles the staff at Grant to change the 
role of teachers to that of activators of learning who design learning experiences that build on learner strengths and needs,
 
create new 
knowledge using real
-
life problem solving and help all students identify their ta
lents, purpose, and passion. In addition, Grant students 
engage in Restorative Justice and Responsive Classroom practices and are exposed to the Social Justice standards.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The current Grant School facility was built in 1937 as a Public Works Administration project in the heart of the Sunset Park 
neighborhood in Santa Monica. 
The entire campus has high
-
speed Internet conn
ectivity, access to technology, and has recently undergone improvements in modern windows, floors, 
and paint. In 2018, new playground equipment with impact
-
resistant synthetic turf was installed on the main play yard. Additionally, in 2019, impact
-
resistan
t synthetic turf was installed on the Kindergarten playground. Also, during the 2018 
-
 
2019 school year, the entire exterior of the campus was 
painted and new lunch tables were purchased to replace old and rusting tables. The school's educationally
-
focused
 
wall and ground murals have been 
repainted and the landscaping has undergone major improvements through parents' efforts during multiple School Beautification
 
Days. The school 
administration will continue to work closely with the District's Facilities dep
artment to ensure that all repairs to the existing systems are completed in a 
timely manner.
 
 
Planned facility improvements for the 2019 
-
 
2020 and 2020 
-
 
2021 school years include the introduction of HVAC, modern electronic door locks on all 
rooms, a high
er courtyard wall in the front of the school to improve security, security cameras and a buzzer entry system, and an updated 
fire alarm 
system. Future plans include a major remodel of the campus which may include a new two
-
story building that will house cl
assrooms, a science lab, and 
music and art classrooms. This remodel may also include the expansion of outdoor learning spaces extended out from the classr
ooms and a reimagining 
of the library to become a state
-
of
-
the
-
art media center.
 
 
The school staff wil
l continue to instill in our students a pride of ownership of their school and are expected to assist staff in keeping the gr
ounds safe 
and litter
-
free. The buildings and grounds are well
-
maintained and in fair operable condition. Grant School has a unique
 
appearance as evidenced by the 
hundreds of handpainted ceramic tiles by the students depicting self
-
portraits, murals, and images of the school mascot, the Grant Gecko.

an was conducted by the 
entire school staff, including all support staff, in August 2019. Grant School is a secure campus duri
ng school hours. All visitors are required to wear 
official identification badges. During the school day, access to the school campus is closely monitored and limited. Before e
ntering the campus, all visitors 
are required to check
-
in with office staff by s
howing a valid form of identification and be cleared through the Raptor identification system which is tied 
into the Meghan's Law database. All school district staff are required to wear their official identification badge at all tim

-
up procedures for students and parents. These new protocols 
will be expanded in the 2020 
-
 
2021 school through construction projects slated to be completed by
 
the end of Summer 2020. All students are taught the 
rules of safety for games and outdoor equipment.
 
 
All staff and students, including parents on the Safety Committee, engage in disaster and emergency drills which include fire
, earthquake, lockdown and 
a
ctive shooter scenarios, on a monthly basis. Key staff members serve as members of crisis teams that are trained in search an
d rescue, first aid, and 
community engagement. Grant School employs Campus Monitors that supervise entrances and playgrounds before
 
school and during lunch and Classified 
staff supervise the playgrounds before school and during the morning recess periods. Grant School enjoys a close working rela
tionship with the Santa 
Monica Police Department and the Santa Monica Fire Department.
