About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to pub
lish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepar
e a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consisten
t with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information a
bout the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school 
principal or the

-
20)
 
Miller Creek Elementary School District held a Public Hearing on October 9, 2019, and determined that each school within the 
district had sufficient and 
good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of Californ
ia. Textbooks 
and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, mak
ing the textbooks used in the 
school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation 
is made to the School 
Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All rec
ommended materials are available for parent examination at the district 
office prior to adoption. The table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other 
instructional materials used at the 
school.
