that contains additional information about this school and 
comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic 
system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., 
the California State Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Goldenrod Elementary sets a high priority upon ensuring that there are sufficient textbooks and mate
rials to support the school educational program.  
Textbook selection is done by the district, grade level and subject area committees coordinated by the Assistant Superintende
nt of Educational Services.  
All textbooks must be adopted from the most recently
 
approved State matrices or local governing board approved lists.  Textbook purchases are 
consistent with the content cycles of the California Frameworks as District IMF and other funding sources permit.
 
Categorical funding also allows the purchase of supp
lementary materials for English Learners to accelerate pupils as rapidly as possible towards grade 
level proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking.  These materials are used in addition to the basic Reading/Language Arts
 
and other core materials 
provid
ed for every student and are correlated to the State Standards
-
aligned textbooks.

education population and the California Alternate Assessmen
ts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the Univers
ity of

Professional development has become part of the daily work life of the 
Kerman 
Unified teaching teams. Teachers, administrators, and support 
staff participate in workshops, seminars, coach one another, plan lessons 
together, and collaborate for the purpose of student achievement. The 
professional learning community understands that t
eachers need 
collaboration time with one another. As a result, there is much support for 
providing the time and resources teachers require for the purpose of 
changing their practice. Teachers are afforded opportunities to participate 
in curriculum developm
ent, learn and share successful methods of 
reaching student, discuss comprehensive and efficient ways to implement 
standards, and continue their own learning. The district and school site 
provide professional development days for staff. These days are devo
ted 
to curriculum training, discussing achievement data, and grade level 
collaboration. Staff also have the opportunity to attend out of the district 
conferences to enhance their skills as educators.

2.  Child Abuse Reporting:
 
Teachers and other school employees are required by law to report any cases of suspected child abuse or child neglect. Report
s are investigated by the 
Department of Social Services
 
to determine if any follow
-
up on the report is necessary.
 
3.  Disaster Procedures:
 
In order to ensure the safety of students and school personnel, the School Site Council has created a comprehensive Disaster 
Preparedness Plan. 
Emergency drills are held on
ce a month and evaluated for effectiveness.
 
4.  School Discipline:
 
Goldenrod Elementary has created a school wide discipline plan in order to communicate high standards and expectations and to
 
hold students 
accountable for their behavior. The discipline pl
an is given to every student and reviewed in student assemblies or classroom presentations. Staff 
members consistently enforce the school wide standards. The school is developing an anti
-
bullying program modeled after the District guidelines. Class 
discuss
ions, staff presentations, purchase of anti
-
bully books, development of peer mediation, and a school assembly are some of the steps taken to 
promote an anti
-
bullying environment.
 
5.  Procedures to Notify Teachers of Dangerous Pupils:
 
If a student is deemed
 
dangerous because of behavior at school or behavior outside of school which has been dealt with by county juvenile authoritie
s, 
the teacher(s) of the student will be promptly notified of the status of the student by School Innovation and Advocacy.
 
6.  Sex
ual Harassment Policy:
 
Goldenrod Elementary strictly adheres to KUSD policies which prohibit sexual harassment or discrimination of any kind. The se
xual harassment policy is 
distributed to each student at the beginning of the school year in our Handbook an
d employees are advised of their duty to take prompt action if they 
become aware of any incidents of sexual harassment.
 
7.  School wide Dress Code:
 
Goldenrod Elementary believes that a clearly defined dress code contributes to a positive school environment
. The primary standards for student dress 
and grooming include: the student should be neat and clean at school, and the student should not wear clothing that compromis
es safety or modesty or 
that is disruptive to the educational process.
 
8.  Safe and Order
ly Environment:
 
Goldenrod Elementary believes a safe and orderly environment is necessary to ensure a positive learning experience for all st
udents. Regular supervision 
of students is the core of creating and maintaining a safe and orderly environment. Tea
chers, administrators, classified staff members, and parent 
volunteers consistently supervise and interact with students to reinforce behavioral expectations and safety standards.
