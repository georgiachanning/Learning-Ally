By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Golden Oak Elementary School provides a clean, safe environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The school is 
situated on 16 acres. School facilities were built between 1938 and 
1969, with additions built in 1995. They span more 
than 76,900 square feet, and include the library, cafeteria, school office and classrooms. The facility strongly supports 
teaching and learning through its ample classroom and playground space. Golden Oak 
Elementary School underwent 
modernization that included air conditioning installation, upgrades to the roof and electrical upgrades. Most recently, in 
2014, five portable classrooms were added to support enrollment growth and reduced class sizes.
 
 
Cleaning
 
Process and Schedule
 
The District has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the District. A summary of these standards is available at the
 
school office or at the District office. The site administration team works with the custodial staff to deve
lop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school. A team of four full
-
time custodians ensure classrooms, restrooms and campus 
grounds are kept clean and safe on a daily basis. A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the District to 
ensur
e that all classrooms and facilities are well
-
maintained and provide a suitable learning environment.   Deep sanitizing 
procedures take place monthly in the entire school with the purpose of eliminating germs and to prevent/reduce exposure 
to illnesses.
 
 
M
aintenance and Repair
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors and site 
administrators are proactive and conduct inspections at school sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep 
the 
school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient 
service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The District maintenance staff has indicated that 100% 
of all 
toilets on school grounds are in working order.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The District contributes to the deferred maintenance fund (Fund 14) to cover annual maintenance costs that occur 
through
-
out the year or replacement of existing school 
building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting and floor systems.  These maintenance costs are 
typically for major repairs.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessm
ents for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in t
he administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have
 
successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Golden Oak Elementary School.  All visitors must check in and out at 
the school office with their identification card, such as Drivers License, which is the only entrance to the s
chool (single 
point entry).  We use Raptor Visitor Management System in all of our schools to strengthen our campus safety practices 
for students, faculty, staff and parents.  The Raptor system allows us to screen all visitors, contractors and volunteers b
y 
comparing their name and date of birth with a national database of registered sex offenders.  Once entry is approved, 
Raptor issues a badge that identifies the visitor, the date and the purpose of the visit.  All visitors onto campus must 
identify themse
lves with a visitor pass and must check
-
in through the office.  As an additional measure of safety, before 
and after school, there are crossing guards at all major cross walks to help mitigate traffic and to ensure that students are
 
crossing the street saf
ely.
 
 
The school is in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and State earthquake 

Fire d
rills and/or lock down drills are conducted on a monthly basis and earthquake drills are held once a school year. 
Safety Kits are placed throughout school facilities to provide proper supplies during an emergency situation. Monitoring 
of school grounds is 
performed by assigned staff members before, during, and after school.  Safety Preparedness Week 
takes place twice a year to provide full
-
school training in the following:  earthquake, lock down, fire, reverse evacuation, 
and hit
-
the
-
deck procedures and pro
tocol.
 
 
A Comprehensive Safety Plan was developed by the school in consultation with local law enforcement in order to comply 
with Senate Bill 187 of 1997. The plan provides students and staff a means to ensure a safe and orderly learning 
environment. Comp
onents of the Comprehensive Safety Plan include child abuse reporting procedures, school discipline, 
suspension, and expulsion procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, 
procedures for safe ingress and egr
ess from school, and sexual harassment policy. Golden Oak Elementary School reviews 
and updates the plan annually with the assistance and approval by our School Site Council. The plan was last updated in 
the Spring of 2019. An updated copy of the plan is a
vailable to the public at the school office, the District office, or the 
school website at www.goldenoaktigers.com.
