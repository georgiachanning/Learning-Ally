Local school boards for each public elementary and secondary school in the 
state issue the School 
Account
-
ability Report Card (SARC) annually. The SARC provides parents and other interested 

which improvements are needed. It is import
ant to note that since we are a community day school, 
the rate of transiency is very high, which makes it difficult to gather the data in the SARC.
 
 
Clovis Community Day School (CCDS) was established as one self
-
contained classroom in August 
2003 to 
serve at
-
risk students in grades 4
-
6 who had not been successful in a comprehensive school 
setting nor benefited from on
-
site intervention programs. In 2004
-
05, one block
-
style classroom 
for grade 7 and one for grade 8 were added. In 2005
-
06, three block
-
s
tyle classrooms for grades 9
-
12 were added to form two small community day schools Clovis Community Day Elementary (one 
classroom, grades 4
-
6) and Clovis Community Day Secondary (five classrooms, grades 7
-
12). In 
2008
-
09, two separate freshman classes were
 
added to bring the total to seven secondary 
classrooms (105 students). In 2015
-
16, CCDS opened up a culinary arts classroom for all of 
Alternative Education. This now brings a total of eight secondary teachers. Instructional programs 
are designed to meet 
the needs of all students while maintaining high expectations and standards. 
We are dedicated to ongoing improvement and take pride in the achievement of our students.
 
 
As of 2017
-
18, Clovis Community Day School has two elementary classrooms for grades 4
-
6
, two 
intermediate classrooms for grades 7
-
8, and six classrooms for grades 9
-
12. CCDS is committed to 
establishing strong academic programs in order to promote the success of all students as they 
transition into their comprehensive school sites. All CCDS 
staff members understand the 
importance of providing a quality education through exemplary teaching practices and a 
commitment to excellence. We feel that all students regardless of socioeconomic, physical or 
cultural differences can learn and be successfu
l. We are committed to establishing traditions that 
will provide a strong foundation for future academic growth and achievement. Developing 
partnerships between staff members, students, parents and community members is essential for 
creating an environment
 
that meets the needs of all students at Clovis Community Day School.
 
 
The mission of CCDS is to prepare all students academically to be successful and productive 
members of society by establishing interpersonal relationships and to provide services and su
pport 
in a safe, nurturing environment. The responsibility of the school is to provide emotional support, 
academic instruction and behavioral skill building.
 
 
Alternative education is a valid intervention to the comprehensive school. Whether students are 
a
ssigned voluntarily or involuntarily, our mission is to provide an excellent educational program 
with opportunities to positively change behaviors, correct academic deficiencies, demonstrate 
improved attendance, and provide evidence of improved attitudes. 
Students in grades 4
-
8 may 
complete their intervention plan and return to their home school within six to 18 weeks with a 
recommendation from their teacher, support from Student Services and School Attendance (SSSA) 
and approval from their comprehensive si
te. Appropriate students in grades 10
-
12 may transfer to 
a comprehensive high school at the end of the semester, Gateway High School after six weeks, or 
can possibly stay at Clovis Community Day Secondary. Credit and curriculum requirements are 
aligned wit
h comprehensive schools in order for the students to make a smooth transition back to 
their home school, move to the next grade and earn a high
-
school diploma.

We are dedicated to continual improvement in all aspects of our school. High expectations, accountability, and high 
standards for our 
students and staff will provide the foundations for future growth and accomplishments. Our goal is for students to successful
ly exit CCDS 
so they can have the opportunity to become involved in the numerous school activities that are offer
ed on a comprehensive campus. If 
you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us at (559) 327

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educatio
nal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, d
ata reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.c
a.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Clovis Community Day School moved to its current location at the portable school in 
2010
-
11. This facility provides the students with fenced
-
in playground 
areas, a basketball blacktop and two baseball/softball fields.
 
 
This also includes 10 portable classrooms, a large portable multipurpose room with a kitchen area, a counseling center, p
ortables used for psychological 
and intervention services, a workroom and a future library presently being used for staff and student meetings. CCDS is locat
ed across from the 
Professional Development Building on the east side of the district office comple
x.
 
 
CCDS provides a clean, safe learning environment. The care and maintenance of the classrooms, office facilities, restrooms, e
xterior maintenance and 
landscaping are of the highest priority. Alternative education shares three daytime and two 
evening custodians who perform basic cleaning operations 
in each classroom every day. In addition, deep cleaning is conducted twice a year at each site. A planned maintenance meeting
 
is scheduled each year to 
review school repairs and to discuss future sch
ool improvements. When parents and guardians were asked to grade how well the buildings and grounds 
are maintained at Clovis Community Day School on the 2018

stepping on to 
the CCDS campus. Repairs are taken care of in a timely manner and graffiti is removed immediately. Through increased
 
community awareness, school 
pride and an open
-
campus policy, we hope to continue to keep vandalism and burglary low.
 
 
Staff members are placed on yard duty before school, during lunchtime, breaks and after school at strategic points throughout
 
campus to v
iew student 
interaction and address visitors to campus. A student relations liaison helps provide a safe school campus along with a schoo
l resource officer (SRO).
 
 
Clovis Community Day Elementary comprises of two classrooms, and Clovis Community Day Second
ary consists of two grade 7
-
8 classrooms and six grade 
9
-
12 classrooms. CCDS went through new construction in 2014
-
15 as we added a high school science lab, a Career Technical Education (CTE) classroom 
(culinary arts) and a new office building that include

Resource Specialist Program classroom. Restrooms were added along with a playground area for our elementary students. Junior 
high and high school 
restrooms ar
e centrally located in the center of campus. The school secretaries and/or the school nurse, located at the neighboring Gatew
ay High School 
campus, provide nursing support. Concrete planter boxes, tables and benches, playground areas, and fields allow the 
students the same opportunity as 
on comprehensive campuses. Technology is available with document cameras, ceiling
-
mounted LCD projectors and computers with internet are 
accessible in every classroom. Currently, all four alternative education schools share
 
one central library that is located at Gateway.
 
 
Teachers, instructional aides, school administration, our SRL, the Transitions Team and SRO help maintain a safe school envir
onment by being out to duty 
on a regular, scheduled basis. Cameras have been inst
alled around campus and all staff members have radios to better communicate needs and issues. 
According to the 2018
-
19 School Parent SART Survey, 100% of the parents in grades 4
-
12 felt that school personnel and site safety procedures are in 
place to maint
ain a safe and secure school environment for their child.
 
 
Philosophically, the district believes that schools are the hub of their neighborhoods. As a result, a high priority is place
d on building and maintaining 
excellent facilities as 
economically as possible.
 
 
In June 2012, voters within the CUSD approved Measure A. This bond measure assisted in the construction during the 2014
-
15 school
-
year. These bond 
measure funds were combined with state bond funds and developer fees to initiate p
rojects throughout the district. Funds from Measure A provide 
improvements at every CUSD school site, including Community Day School.
 
 
Since CCDS moved during the summer of 2010, additional improvements have been made to make the campus accommodating to st
udents and support 
staff needs. Regular school maintenance is provided to keep our campus clean and orderly.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co

We encourage all parents and guardians to become involved with their child

s education, at the classroom level, t
he schoolwide level as well as the 
district level. Each school

s 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) describes the school

s basic educational program and the categorical 
supplementary programs/services that are designed to support student achievemen
t of each and every student. Parental involvement is a necessary and 
vital part of developing the SPSA as well as our overall program. At the district level, parent committees provide input into
 
each of the site

s SPSA and to 
the district

s Local Education
 
Agency Plan (LEAP). If you would like additional information on any of the District Parent Councils or Committees, please 
call your child

s school. The principal, learning director or guidance instructional specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, o
r go to 
www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical programs and funding. For more information, please ca
ll your school or go to 
http://www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
School Site 
Council (SSC): All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form an SSC. The SSC is composed of parents, students 
at the secondary 
level and school personnel. It is responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
School Plan
 
for Stud
ent Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.
 
 
District Advisory Committee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC): The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves 
as an advisory committee 
for the purpose of 
advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school community. They serve to 
share 
information and comments both at the district and site level. These education programs are supplemental education opportuniti
es provided to students 
who are disadvantaged, English learners (EL), foster youth and/or at
-
risk. The SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California Education 
Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Lea
rner Advisory Committee (ELAC): All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are required to form an ELAC. The ELAC is c
omposed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regardin
g services for English learners 
as well as conducts an annual survey. Members serve for two years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC): Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall b
e a functioning District 
Englis
h Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC). It is important that each school site ELAC elect a DELAC representative and arrange to 
have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting. Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent
/guardian of an EL or former 
EL student (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) 
elected to serve as the DELAC 
representative by the site ELAC.
 
 
District Indian Education Parent 
Advisory Committee (IPAC): The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee meets four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achievement of our students, comm
unity agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan Native students in grades
 
K
-
12. The program 
assists eligible students to achieve at the same challenging state performance standards expected of all student
s in grades pre
-
K
-
12.
 
 
Local Control Accountability Plan
 
 
(LCAP) Forums: CUSD assists in developing an annual plan that works to better align the academic plan with the district expen
diture plan that is approved 
by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Paren
ts and other stakeholder groups are invited to participate in the development of the LCAP through 
participation of school and district committee meetings and community forums. LCAP schools, District meetings and community f
orums are exciting 
opportunities 
for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the district and share their ideas on how CUSD can provide quality 
opportunities 
and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in the forums will inform the District

s
 
LCAP

s funding priorities over the 
next several years. 
 
 
These forums are designed to provide an opportunity for school communities to hear about CUSD

s current efforts to support youth and families and to 
provide input and feedback on future plans and op
portunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to share new ideas to support 
identified groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.

Professional development is ongoing at CCDS to ensure the staff keeps abreast of new instructional strategies, innovative tea
ching techniques, current 
trends in 
education and applied technology in the field of education.
 
 
Staff development is collaboratively selected by the staff and administration from a yearly staff survey. For the last severa
l years, the focus has been on 
the following areas: team building acti
vities, universal screening, Positive Behavioral Interventions and Strategies (PBIS), MTSS/RtI, inservices on new 
textbook materials, Ruby Payne strategies, aligning and revising our quarterly benchmark assessments to the Common Core, deve
loping profession
al 
learning communities (PLC), the use of technology in education (such as using achievement data to lead instruction), technolo
gy as an instructional tool, 
social emotional learning, Stop the Bleed, Digital Citizenship and discipline strategies. Our focus
 
in technology and teaching strategies provide teachers 
with an alternative teaching modality. Multiple modalities offer students avenues to success. Credit recovery classes also ut
ilize technology.
 
 
Alternative education continues to address strategies wi
th the at
-
risk students and training the teacher to use student
-
testing data to drive instruction. 
It continues to be addressed through PLC meetings, faculty meetings, and conferences. During staff and PLC meetings, teachers
 
share best practices, 
establish
 
school goals, discuss behavioral strategies, review curriculum, participate in articulation meetings, and discuss progress to
ward goal attainment.

Staff development this year will continue to integrate more hands
-
on learning and activities into the clas
srooms as well as focus on technology and 
instructional strategies to help raise student achievement. There will also be a focus on revising pretests and post
-
tests that help prepare students for 
the CAASSP test. Teachers also discuss behavioral situations
 
that occur on campus and how to better support our student population, MTSS and the 
establishment of an intervention team, review intervention resources, and provide support groups to assist students in changi
ng behaviors so they can 
better focus on learn
ing.
 
 
We will also continue to improve team building and curriculum articulation between elementary, intermediate and high school a
s related to common 
instructional strategies. Teachers are encouraged to take advantage of professional growth opportunities 
that reinforce the subject content standards. 
Release time to visit classrooms is provided to support staff development topics. Additional site and district staff developm
ent opportunities may be 
provided for conferences and in
-
services offered through our
 
CI & A Department, including release time to develop new programs and share strategies.
 
 
Staff development time along with PLC collaboration is also provided during staff meetings.
 
 
Teachers are supported through implementation of new instructional strate
gies by the observation process and reflective conversations. Individual 
conferences are conducted with each teacher to discuss classroom instruction and to collaboratively develop teacher self
-
evaluations so the teachers 
can target areas of improvement an
d praise teachers for their areas of strength. Data is collected through the quarter benchmark assessments. A yearly 
meeting also takes place with every teacher to review individual goals and their self
-
evaluation.
 
 
The district focused all professional de
velopment activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi
-
tiered system 
of supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding.
 
 
In the 2018
-
19 
school year, the district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered profess
ional 
development opportunities on staff development days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after
-
s
chool workshops were also 
offered throughout the school year.
 
 
One hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty
-
five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching 
through the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site
-
based training and 
district sponsored training that may 
have included: curriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi
-
tiered systems of support or RtI, and culturally relevant 
instructional practices.

District Advisory Committee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC 
serves as an advisory committee 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These educa
tion programs are supplemental education opportunities that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  The SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 528
52 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are required to form an ELAC. T

and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in t
he district, there shall be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a DELAC representative and arra

bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/guardian of an EL or

provide in
put and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to share new ide
as to support 
identified groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorica

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 

ial characteristics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economically disadvantaged ho
mes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because t
hey have a primary language other than English.  Children, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally provided through the base/core curriculum program.
  
The needs of our 
children are identified and supplementa
l services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Categorical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support to meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of 
high quality learning opportunities and access to the core curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additional assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom pro
gram (base/core curriculum) 
and address any
 
learning gaps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff development.  Staff
 
development 
activities are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other s
taff to challenge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
