School Description
 
Welcome to Foster Road Elementary School. Our school has made great progress towards enriching 
student learning and focusing on individual student needs.
 
 
 
Our school includes PreSchool, Transitional K, and Kindergarten through fifth grade students and 
is 
part of the Norwalk
-
La Mirada Unified School District. Our school is a community center school 
located in a middle to lower class residential community in La Mirada. Foster Road includes State 
preschools on its campus as well as special education preschool
 
and special education classes for 
moderate to severely handicapped students for TK
-
2. Our site buildings have beautiful murals that 
create an inviting environment for staff, parents, and students when they are on our campus. In 
addition we have a thriving
 
garden that is maintained by staff and students creating a quiet 
beautiful space for reading and learning. 
 
 
 
Foster Road Elementary involves all stakeholders in providing the best educational program for 
our students in a safe, nurturing environment that
 
respects others and is conducive to developing 
well
-
balanced, lifelong learners.
 
 
 
We have teachers and support staff that strive to remediate and challenge all students to reach 
their potential through the use of I
-
Ready in both reading and math. 
The i
-
R
eady Math computer 
program for students is for Kinder through fifth grade students and they are provided lessons at their 

-
Ready Reading 
program functions similarly and is 
also for Kinder through fifth grade. The students in K
-
2 take a 
diagnostic test three times a year, while the 3
-
5 grade students take two diagnostic tests with the third 
being deferred due to their taking of state SBAC test.
 
We maintain two fully functiona
l and supported 
labs that allow teachers and students to access to i
-
Ready as well as all other district and school 
site programs which include Reading A
-
Z and Epic. Classrooms are also equipped with ipads that 
allow them access to all programs. Teachers p
rovide opportunities for Book Buddies, which pairs 
upper grades with primary grades for once a week reading time. Special education students are 
mainstreamed with our regular education students, fostering a more caring inclusive school climate 
that benefit
s all of our students.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and
 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

supervised by noon supervision aides at morning recess, and lunch. All students, parents, and staff enter school through the 
front gate of school which 
is monitored with a camera and the gate is electronically controlled by fron
t office.
 
 
All other gates of entry are
 
locked after the school day starts. Visitors 
must enter the school through the main gate and sign in at the office, where they receive a badge to wear throughout their st
ay.

We revise our School Safety Plan annually
. The plan includes procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and inventories of emergency supplies. Each year 
we continue to add more emergency supplies to our campus. We share the plan with all staff during staff meetings and with par
ents at our SSC meeti
ngs.
 
 
We practice fire drills monthly, and other district disaster throughout the year. We hold trainings for staff on emergency pr
eparedness. We also work 
closely with the City of La Mirada and have them provide information nights to our community on the 
topics of disaster preparedness and community 
watch.
