School Description
 
Audubon Elementary School provides a challenging learning environment, 
demanding excellence 
from our students and staff, and capitalizing on the rich diversity of our community and the 
supportive involvement of our parents. Audubon Elementary School is committed to our 
implementation of Response to Intervention (RTI) model. R
TI is a framework for the integration of 
academic and behavior supports for all students in our school community. Our school
-
wide focus 
on RTI ensures high quality, research
-
based instruction in the general education classroom.
 
 
The California Core Standar
ds are our guide for what students should know and be able to do at 
each grade level. We teach to these standards, implementing curriculum that emphasizes listening, 
speaking, critical thinking, reading, writing and mathematics. Our Elementary curriculum I
ncludes:  
English language arts, mathematics, science, history/social science, health and physical education, 
music, art and technology. The RTI framework includes our school
-
wide Positive Behavior 
Intervention and Support (PBIS) program. PBIS supports soc
ial and emotional learning 
competencies for all students, cultivating a community committed to our Four Pillars of Excellence: 
Respect, Responsibility, Safety and Engagement.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publis
h a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a
 
Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent w
ith data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members 
should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The San Mateo
-
Foster City School District makes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in thes
e efforts, the 
District has developed and the Board of Trustees has approved,
 
a District
-
wide Facilities Implementation Master Plan in order to bring each school site 
up to district facility standards for educational excellence. To support that effort, in 2008 the community passed a $175 mil
lion facilities bond to repair, 
renovate,
 
upgrade and increase capacity at District schools. Bond funding has been used to upgrade facilities over the past 10 years.  
A lunch shade 
structure and age appropriate play structures were added to the campus, student classroom furniture was replaced, ex
terior painting was completed, 
and perimeter fencing was installed for school security.
 
 
In 2015, the community once again passed a $142 million bond (Measure X).  Phase I is well underway,  adding classrooms and a
 
gym at Abbott and Borel 
and a gym at Bays
ide Academy, in addition to a new fourth elementary school in Foster City.
 
 
With the passing of the State Facilities Bond in November 2016, the District will seek any State Modernization matching funds
 
on a percentage basis, to 
assist with the expenditures
 
for any major planned modernization work projects.
 
 
The District's Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are c
ompleted in a timely manner, 
while the Operations staff ensures that the schoo
ls are kept clean.  A work order process through a program called "Akita Box" is used to ensure efficient 
service; emergency repairs are given the highest priority. In addition to responding to emergency repairs in a timely manner,
 
the maintenance departme
nt 

 
 
Most District schools are staffed with at least one day, and one night custodian to provide a clean and hazard
-
free environment. Some of the larger 
schools, 
particularly the middle schools are staffed with one day custodian and two or three night custodians.  The Principal, along w
ith the maintenance 
staff, work with the custodians to develop cleaning schedules to ensure clean and safe schools. The custodial s

which are available at the District Office. In addition, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the Stat
e of California's Office of Public 
School Construction to evaluate the conditions o
f each schools facility. This evaluation is completed annually for each site.  The following school site

The San Mateo
-
Foster City School District is committed to providing quality professional development 
opportunities for all staff. Training is available 
through three professional development days, staff meetings, scheduled release times during the school year, on early release
 
days and during the 
summer. Our primary focus for professional development is a
ligning instruction to meet the California State Standards and the implementation of our 
adopted materials for mathematics and English Language Arts/English Language development. Professional learning opportunities
 
integrate content 
development and researc
h
-
based instructional practices to meet the needs of all learners, especially English Learners, Students with Disabilities and 
Socio
-
economically Disadvantaged. Professional Development in SMFCSD is grounded in the California State Standards and the resear
ch from the 
California State Adopted ELA/ELD, Mathematics and NGSS Frameworks. Elementary teachers have the opportunity for training in l
anguage and literacy, 
science and mathematics. Middle School teachers receive subject specific professional development
 
on the California Standards and strategies to support 
conceptual understanding and improve student learning.

Teachers engage in a variety of Professional Development structures including, site or department specific PD, teacher learni
ng communities withi
n and 
across sites and in departments or grade levels 
-
 
both in large and small groups. Our district also coordinates district
-
level training with site
-
based 
professional development opportunities based on site data. Over the last year, district and site l
eaders developed professional learning opportunities by 
evaluating and adjusting our professional growth strategies, first by gathering immediate feedback (e.g., exit tickets and fe
edback surveys) from teacher 
and leader training and collaboration sessions
. This data was then used to adjust and focus training and collaboration strategies during the year. We also 
evaluate and adjust professional growth strategies through on
-
going examination of student performance data (academic and wellness). District 
leade
rship meets quarterly with school leaders to review current student data, to identify the professional growth causes for stud
ent successes and 
challenges, to monitor the impact of key professional growth strategies and to plan forward. This work then infor

SPSA. In parallel with this work, site leaders lead the same process with teacher teams using more specific data (e.g. grade
-
level and classroom data), 
where they couple that data with teacher reflections on their pro
fessional learning and plan month
-
to
-
month adjustments in professional learning 
strategies and yearly adjustments in their SPSAs. District leaders also lead a similar process with SMFCSD teacher union repr
esentatives to elicit their 
feedback on the distric
t professional growth strategies and to get their recommendations for strategy adjustments in the district LCAP. Additionally
, 
starting this year, SMFCSD will gather once
-
a
-
year survey feedback from teachers on their professional learning needs and on thei
r experience of current 
strategies which will inform yearly adjustments to LCAP and SPSA professional growth strategies.
 
 
Our beginning teachers also receive additional professional development provided by our District
-
based Induction program. Veteran teac
hers can 
participate in a Peer Assistance Review (PAR) program for individual support.
