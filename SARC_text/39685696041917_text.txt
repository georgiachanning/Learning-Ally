By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Our Mission
 
We believe all children can learn and we 
will establish high standards of learning with the expectation for all students to 
achieve. It is our job to create an environment in our classrooms that engages students in academic work that results in a 
high level of achievement. We are confident that w
ith our support and help, students can master challenging curricula, 
and we expect them to do so. We are prepared to work collaboratively with colleagues, students, and parents to achieve 
this shared educational purpose (DuFour, 1997a). 
 
 
Our Vision
 
We 
will develop a safe and welcoming environment that empowers children to be responsible, caring, independent 
thinking participants in all life activities. The school community (staff, students and parents) will become active 
participants in each child's edu
cation. Our community will collaborate to create a learning environment with high 
expectations for academic and social success. We will stress that learning must be meaningful and purposeful to engage 
all learners. Together we will provide nurturing experi
ences for students that will foster pride in themselves, others, and 
their school. Our school will aid parents in developing the necessary skills to encourage positive life experiences. Through 
professional development opportunities and collaboration, teac
hers will base their teaching on the needs of the students. 
 
 
Our Values
 
 
In order to advance our shared vision of an exemplary school, we will: 
 

 
Provide an inviting classroom environment for students 
-
 
an environment with clear expectations, consistent 
co
nsequences, and specific, articulated, academic goals.
 

 
Help all students achieve the intended outcomes of the curriculum by addressing their individual needs and 
learning styles.
 

 
Use methods of assessment that enable us to monitor the learning of 
individual students.
 

 
Collaborate with one another and our students so that we can achieve our collective goals more effectively.
 

 
Demonstrate our commitment to ongoing professional development and continuous improvement.
 

 
Promote a positive school climate by
 
modeling the qualities and characteristics that we hope to instill in our 
students.
 

 
Involve parents in the education of their children by keeping them informed of student progress and offering 
suggestions for assisting their students.

Lincoln Elementary Sch
ool was established in 1878. Since then, it has grown from 29 to over 720 students in grades 
Preschool through 6, and from one teacher to a staff of 29 full time and part time classroom teachers, four preschool 
instructors, a full time speech therapist, fo
ur music teachers, a full time counselor, a part time psychologist, 21 full and 
part time classified staff members, assistant principal, and principal. Programs include Title One, Special Education, Gifted
 
and Talented Education (GATE), Band, Chorus, Strin
gs, After School Enrichment and Safety (ASES), Extended Day Reading 
Academy, and English Language Development support.
 
 
Activities for students include Student Council, Conflict Managers, Leadership, and Yearbook. Lincoln Elementary has a 
very traditional 
setting where safety is a number one priority. The teachers are compassionate and caring, and committed 
to developing an atmosphere of mutual respect. Every situation is treated as a learning opportunity. Approximately eighty
-
six percent of our families ar
e socio
-
economically disadvantaged, and helping the families feel welcome and keeping them 
informed are constant goals.
 
 
Our Parent Teacher Association is committed to the welfare of its students and collaborates with parents, staff and the 
community to pr
ovide: Red Ribbon Week, Family Math Night, Family Fall Festival, and Family Literacy Nights. PTA also 
plans successful community
-
building events: Back to school Night Barbecue, Fall Festival, Halloween Parade, movie nights, 
Spring Festival, and 6th grade p
romotional. 
 
 
Lincoln Elementary is a strong learning community not just in theory, but in practice. Teachers are committed to a 
standards
-
based curriculum and are becoming more discriminating about how they use adopted programs. They have 
become hungry fo
r data when making decisions about student learning. The organizational structure includes a Leadership 
Team to help determine the focus of staff development, and the Academic Support Team and Student Success Team, 
which looks at individual student needs a
nd provide extra support for students and their classroom teachers. 
 
 
Our entire school community is committed to closing the achievement gap for English language learners, Title One 
students, educationally disadvantaged students, students with IEPs, 
and all other students working below grade level. Our 
Title One program has been instrumental in helping meet the academic and social/emotional needs of these students. 
Special Education staff members may serve non
-
identified, general education students as
 
appropriate. These services may 
be provided in general or special education settings. As the law states, general education teachers will provide services to 
special education students in collaboration with special education teachers and as provided for in
 
the Individual Education 
Plans for students. The mission statement governing our practice is difficult to realize, but critical to our school communit
y. 
 
 
While we continue to focus on student achievement, we also strive to improve the appearance and cond
ition of our 

21st century education in a traditional setting.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority:
 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Cali
fornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alterna
te achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for 
entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

Lincoln Unified School District provides two professional development days for staff annually as part of the contract, with 
site based follow up scheduled during the year. Early dismissal on Mondays also provides teachers with additional time 
each week to 
collaborate and articulate with other grade level or department teachers.  Teachers work in teams to analyze 
data, determine essential standards and plan instruction. Coaching and professional learning is provided to support 
implementation of new curriculu
m, best practices and  instructional strategies to support the achievement of all students.  
In addition, new teachers are provided with three days of professional learning before the start of the school each year.  
Our goal is to continue to have a highly
 
trained professional staff that supports success for all students in the classroom.  
Lincoln Unified School District is committed to supporting school district staff through quality professional development.
