By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The mission of Concordia Elementary School is to work in conc
ert with parents ans the community to acknowledge and 
celebrate human diversity, to challenge students to reach their full academic potential, to instill responsible, global 
citizenship and to affirm a lifelong love of learning.
 
 
Concordia Elementary Schoo
l is located on the bluffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean in the seaside community of South San 
Clemente. Founded in 1955, Concordia is rich in history and tradition. A recent survey determined that roughly 5 percent 

ol as students themselves. Former Concordia students are prominent in San 
Clemente community affairs and maintain a vested interest in the school. A variety of community partnerships have been 
developed and fostered over the years that have benefited the s
chool and made it a focal point of the community. An 
active Parent Teacher Association supports and enhances the instructional program. In addition, the SPLASH Foundation 
was formed to help support the needs of our student body during the 2012
-
2013 School 
Year to further support our school 
and community. The SPLASH Foundation is a non
-
profit organization founded to assist with fundraising for the needs of 
the school.
 

ares its northern property 
line with San Clemente State Park. The homes that make up the communities of Cypress Shore and Cypress Cove lie 
immediately south of the campus. Directly east of the campus are several apartment complexes. During the 1960s, this 
area was commonly known as the site of the Western White House and was the home of President Richard Nixon and his 
family.
 
The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station lies approximately 2 miles south of the campus, and just south of the power 
plant is the Ma
rine Base at Camp Pendleton. Approximately 60 students from military families attend Concordia, many of 
them on inter
-
district transfer from San Diego County. The welcome presence of military families at Concordia contributes 
to a powerful sense of patriot
ism at the school, as evidenced by the morning flag salute, which is led each day by students.
 
The diverse student population that is generated by this unique community is a cornerstone of Concordia Elementary 
School. Approximately 21% of the students qual
ify for federally subsidized lunches. English Learners make up 7% of the 
population and approximately 18% of the students are Hispanic or Latino. Roughly 71% of the student body is White, and 
a rich variety of ethnic groups are represented in the remaining
 
11% of the student population.
 
Recognized as a California Distinguished School and a National Blue Ribbon School, Concordia focuses on high academic 
achievement for all students. As a Professional Learning Community, teachers work in collaborative teams t
o analyze data, 
modify instruction, and provide intervention as needed to ensure student success. Throughout the instructional day, 
teachers align learning objectives and high student expectations with Common Core State Standards.
 
A unique signature practi
ce that has been implemented at Concordia is Project Splash, a comprehensive, hands
-
on science 
program that incorporates elements of Science, Technology, Engineering Art and Math (STEAM). Project Splash was 
implemented at Concordia in 2008. The cornerstone
 
of Project Splash was a 6 million year old whale fossil that is currently 
housed in the Paleontology Park and Science Discovery Center that has been created on the Concordia campus. When it 
was first discovered at a new home development in Laguna Niguel i

Paleontologists believe that Splash may be one of the most complete specimens of its kind ever found on the North 
American continent.
 
Teachers provide hands
-
on learning opportunities in science that 
introduce students to a number of scientific disciplines, 
including paleontology, while providing real
-
life math and science experiences. The ultimate goal of the program is to offer 
a unique and exciting enrichment activity that is fully aligned with Cali
fornia state standards.
 
Components of the Science Discovery Center and Paleontology Park include:

1) Butterfly Garden: With the support of the San Clemente Garden Club, a beautiful butterfly garden has been created at 
the school. Students are learning abou
t butterfly conservation while experiencing firsthand the beauty, amazing 
behaviors, and life cycles of butterflies.
 
2) Splash Lab: A science laboratory is available for students and is equipped with a variety of instructional materials and 
equipment that 
are used to enhance science instruction. A Science Instructional Assistant is performing hands
-
on activities 
aligned with the CCSS and the classroom curriculum.
 
3) Wyland Wall: Whaling Wall II, the oldest existing whale mural painted by Wyland, the interna
tionally acclaimed artist, 
and has been preserved and installed in the multi
-
purpose room at Concordia Elementary School. The mural is part of 
Project Splash and an important piece of art that the entire community enjoys. The mural allows staff to integrat
e art and 
science. Project Splash is a powerful learning tool. Staff believes that elementary students are naturally fascinated by 
fossils, dinosaurs, and digging in the dirt. Providing students the opportunity to study paleontology, conduct meaningful 
sci
entific research, and access to a rare whale fossil is a powerful and effective way to get students excited about science.

The most recent addition to Concordia is our Makerspace. This innovative classroom funded by the SPLASH 
Foundation 
offers a variety of opportunities for students to explore aspects of STEAM on their own. Weekly projects are guided by 
our instructional aide and parent volunteers, but should they choose, students can also immerse themselves in a number 
of othe
r projects at stations that include a Deconstruction Zone, Artists Loft, KNEX and Snap Circuit Area, Robotics and 
more. Students are free to come and go as they please at recesses and explore whatever they choose. It is one of our most 
popular areas for ki
ds.
 
Concordia Elementary School is a Professional Learning Community of dedicated individuals who are committed to 
providing a quality educational program while promoting the welfare of children in a safe and healthy environment. The 
collaborative efforts 
of community stakeholders ensure the success of each child. The staff and community at Concordia

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Concordia Elementary School is located on the 
bluffs overlooking the beautiful Pacific in the seaside community of San 
Clemente. Concordia was founded in 1955 and is the third oldest school in the District.
 
 
School buildings on the Concordia campus are typical of an older facility. Classrooms are spac
ious and enjoy a great deal 
of natural lighting from an abundance of windows. During the summer of 2005, almost a million dollars in modernization 
funds were spent providing the school with numerous improvements. For the past six decades, Concordia Element
ary 
School has provided a safe and orderly learning environment while promoting the welfare of all children.
 
 
A "Curbside Appeal" was initiated by the school district during the Summer of 2013.  The exterior of the school was painted 
along with many other 
aesthetic improvements to the school site.  A new school sign, new sod, the replacement of 
concrete, and many other additional improvements were made to the school site. Other ongoing facilities improvement 
plans include enhancing our outdoor learning cent
er (in the planning stage) and improving our kindergarten garden to 
provide healthy greens enjoyed by our students.  School security has been enhanced by the addition of several locking 
gates and a new program called Watch D. O. G. S. (Dads of Great Studen
ts) has been implemented whereby volunteer 
dads provide an extra set of eyes on campus, throughout the day. A plan to install security cameras has been submitted 
and we expect to have them installed and working, soon.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Capistrano Unified School District places great value on 
the role of professional learning, and utilizes systems
-
wide 
structures and strategies to promote continuous learning of adults that result in increased learning for students.  The 
ongoing focus for professional learning is to support the district's Wildly
 
Important Goal for Teaching and Learning.  It is 
the district goal to engage students in meaningful, challenging, and innovative educational experiences to increase post
-
secondary options for all students.
 
 
It is the goal of  Capistrano Unified School Dis
trict to ensure all students receive Great First Instruction (GFI).  The vision 
for GFI is that all learning environments include Lesson Preparation, Interaction, Strategies, and Review and Assessment 
as defined by the Sheltered Instruction Observation Pro
tocol (SIOP).  By design, the model for providing professional 
learning is multi
-
tiered, and ranges from large
-
scale, district
-
wide learning opportunities focused on priority areas to site
-
specific, embedded professional learning (including coaching) that 
supports teachers in the transfer of that learning to the 

school hours to further support district initiatives and teacher needs for ongoing
 
professional learning. The outcome of all 
CUSD professional learning is to improve educator effectiveness in order to increase student learning. In support of this 
outcome, administrators participate in professional learning to increase their knowledge of
 
quality practices, California 
Content Standards, and strategies for instructional leadership.
 
 
Since 2004, all schools provide specific release time for embedded professional learning using late start or early release 
days.  In grades K
-
8, this time is kn
own as ACE time (Articulation and Collaboration for Excellence).  The purpose of this 
time is for educators to examine the impact of their practice on student learning, with a focus on continuous improvement.  
Schools work to identify key areas of learning
 
based on an analysis of student data, upon which they place their focus for 
professional learning and set annual measurable goals based upon those identified areas of need. These areas are 
determined through the analysis of student learning data from mult
iple sources, including, but not limited to high stakes 
testing. The action plan developed to accomplish these goals outlines priorities for teacher training and implementation.
 
 
Throughout the year, the structure of collaboration typically involves teache
r teams engaging in ongoing examination of 
standards
-
based curriculum, the examination of meaningful formative and summative assessment data, and powerful 
teaching strategies that get results in student learning. In 2017 the District developed the CUSD Pro
fessional Learning 

Goals, Relational Trust, Focus on Learning, Shared Responsibility, Action
-
Oriented, Data Driven, and Systems and 
Struc
tures for Support  to ensure all students are learning at high levels.  These embedded professional learning activities 
help prepare teams to provide a differentiated instructional program that meets the needs of all students.
 
 
Beginning teachers receive s
ystematic training and support during their first two years of teaching within the CUSD 
Induction Program. This program assists new teachers as they build upon the skills they already possess upon entering the 
field of teaching, and provides them with supp
ort from a veteran teacher. The program is approved by the California State 

to those activities previously described, all teachers may rec
eive support, assistance, and opportunities to grow 
professionally through their participation in school site learning teams, student study teams, from district resource 
teachers, and the Peer Assistance and Review Program.
