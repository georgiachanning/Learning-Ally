By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Happy Valley Community Day School (CDS) provides an opportunity for every student to succeed, everyday.  Our 
community day school provides a positive 
learning culture that supports students from diverse backgrounds, who have 
faced challenges in academics and social emotional learning.  Our teacher applies trauma informed practices within a 
positive, firm, and fair learning environment.  Our students res
pect and appreciate his demeanor and consistent support 
of their daily progress.  Two paraprofessionals provide additional support to the twelve students who are currently 
enrolled in our community day school.  All students are working toward individual go
als that offer opportunities to build 
social
-
emotional and academic skills.  The staff offers differentiated instruction to meet each student's specific needs. The 
community day students attend class in a setting that offers space for individual and small 
group learning.   A variety of 
instructional strategies are utilized to implement standards based instruction, targeting areas of specific need.  Specialize
d 
instruction includes the use of technology, literacy, inquiry, and formative assessment to guide f
urther student learning.
 
Our focus at the community day school is to work with students, families, community, and local agencies to provide 
interventions and supports to guide each student's academic journey.  Our teacher uses curriculum, when applicable,
 
that 
is aligned to the practices of our teachers on our general education sites.  Though strategies are adapted and the learning 
environment differs in size, the use of common curriculum fosters a positive transition for those who return to the general 
ed
ucation population.  Students and families are provided a detailed daily progress report, describing the desired student 
outcomes and an account of the student's behavior that day.  This system is used to provide support and allow for a 
school
-
family
-
stude
nt team approach to encourage positive behavior and inspire growth and improvement in student 
behavior.  The level system sets high expectations for behavior, establishes boundaries, and holds students accountable 
for behavior.  This system is couched in l
oving, supportive encouragement from the teaching staff.  There is a mutual 
respect between educators and the CDS students.
 
Often, the teacher is able to guide students to work as partners to achieve academic results, build character, and 
strengthen socia
l emotional interaction.  Students learn strategies for self regulation, restorative practices, and redirection 
from an escalated situation to re
-
calibrate and engage in learning.  Through these challenges, students build life
-
skills that 
strengthen charac
ter and citizenship.  Students socialize, minimally, with other students in the school cafeteria where they 
eat breakfast and lunch, daily.
 
Staff professional learning experiences have addressed social skill building, Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE's)
, trauma 
informed practices, alignment to our Triple P Parenting Program, as well as curriculum and instruction training.  The CDS 
teacher attends staff meetings and engages in collaboration during our staff meetings.  Our district is implementing a 
distri
ct 
-
wide effort to provide Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) as a framework for sustaining student
-
centered learning opportunities and academic and social growth.  The staff will continue to build and strengthen current 
practices through 
collaborative conversation and seeking input from parents and students.
 
Individual counseling services are provided to our community day students.  Our students are also observed by our school 
psychologist and school psychologist intern in order to prescr
ibe additional support to our students.  Our students 
participate in a weekly small group social emotional learning lesson, provided by one of our counselors.
 
We will begin to work with a lead agency in the next year to strengthen the system and provide a
 
stronger structure for 
our program.
 
Our Happy Valley Community Day School Staff is dedicated to providing a quality education and opportunities for social 
and emotional growth to our students

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Happy Valley Primary School, built 
between 1976 and 1979, went through the modernization process in the summer of 
2006. The oldest parts of the school were completely remodeled: electrical, data lines for computers, plumbing, carpets, 
wall treatments, doors, cupboards, bathrooms and fixture
s. All rooms have central air
-
conditioning, and the school was 
recently painted. The other half of the school was completed in the summer of 2007. Happy Valley Primary School has an 
excellent janitorial staff. The campus is kept clean and is well maintaine
d. All sinks, toilets, and drinking fountains are in 
working condition. The grounds are kept mowed and free of trash. A custodian is always available to ensure a tidy and 
well
-
maintained campus.
 
 
The school has a very large playground. It has playground eq
uipment on the grades 1
-
5 playground and also on the 
kindergarten playground. We are on a large piece of property with lots of room for the children to run and play. Our 
blacktop areas were recently resurfaced, and we have behavior coaches who guide behavi
or as it is outlined in our Positive 
Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) system.

Upon intake, 
parents, administrators, teacher, and student meet to discuss goals and processes of the student and the 
community day school.  Parents are invited to an ongoing conversation regarding student progress. The teacher and 
instructional aides use Class Dojo to
 
communicate with parents on a daily basis.  Many parents meet with the teacher on 
a daily basis.  The teacher and administrator meet monthly to discuss current goals and student needs.  As parents have 
concerns or input, they are included in a "Redirectio
n Plan."  We are currently updating intervention plans for each of our 
students.  These are used to help parents understand the current processes.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-

The Emergency Operations Plan (EOP)  is being strengthened in a district
-
wide effort to synthesize current Readiness and 
Emergency Management Systems (REMS) practices with our local 
needs.  A district team has met to address the specific 
plan for all functional annexes at all possible time
-
frames to assist with the development of a comprehensive plan for 
safety.  We are in the stages of completing the full revision and communicating t
he plan to our staff.  Basic functions will 
be addressed with parents through a variety of communication tools, such as the use of a text app, all
-
call phone calls, 
and our website.
 
 
We have strengthened the safety processes at our school site by limiting 
access to the school to one location.  Adults 
supervise the student drop
-
off and pick
-
up areas before and after school. Students are signed in and out at the office, and 
adults must be listed on the emergency card. Children are not allowed in the front are
a of the school without being 
accompanied by an adult.
 
 
We have a School Safety Plan. Fire, lockdown, and earthquake drills are routinely practiced. The Emergency Procedures

The Happy Valley Union Elementary School 
District provides ongoing professional
-
development opportunities. We have 
two full days dedicated to district
-
wide professional development as well as utilizing our minimum day Monday schedule 
for one hour of professional development each week.  The major 
emphasis of our staff development is in the area of 
Common Core State Standards, Response to Intervention (RTI), utilizing instructional technologies, targeted instruction, 
and student engagement strategies. Our focus is to improve student achievement usin
g data, developing individual plans 
to support student learning, and monitoring student progress. Our district is committed to staff development. In addition 
to three staff development days, we utilize teacher release time, school workshops, and conference
s to support ongoing 
learning. Teachers are supported in their professional development by participating in Differentiated Assistance, literacy 
training, and a vertical collaboration process. We are developing a system that uses improvement science to faci
litate 
continuous improvement in literacy across the content areas and social and emotional learning.  Our LCAP reflects this 
process in goals one and two.
