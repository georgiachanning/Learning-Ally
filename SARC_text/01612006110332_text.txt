By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

We celebrate nearly 30 years of providing teaching excellence to the Livermore commun
ity. Our academic focus this year 

application of skills in real
-
life situations. In mathematics, we are utilizing the workshop model of instruction
, as we have 
in recent years for both writing and reading. Workshop models of teaching allow for differentiated instruction and student 
choice in learning. We are implementing a new literacy curriculum that focuses on both essential phonological skills and
 
comprehension. The program includes correlating ELD lessons, ensuring our English learner students are making steady 
growth in their acquisition of academic English language skills. Finally, in our efforts to address academic, behavioral and 
social
-
emotio
nal needs of our students, we are using the Choose Love curriculum to build social
-
emotional competencies 
and consistent positive behavior expectations and recognition throughout our school.  Students in grades 2
-

School Facility Conditions and Planned
 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Our staff and students keep our campus orderly and free of litter and graffiti. We added seven new classrooms in late 
August 2004, and five more were completed in August 2005. As part of our Modernization Projects (based 
on a 
community
-
supported bond measure), we have four brand new playgrounds in the 2018
-
2019 school year. These 
playgrounds are made from recycled materials, completely accessible to all students, including those with disabilities, with 
rubber mats in lieu 
of tanbark. Our campus is well maintained by our three custodians, district maintenance crews, and 
the LVJUSD Maintenance and Facilities department.
 
 

n its long
-
range 
plan. We currently have ten Chromebook carts to share among the grade 2
-

available for check
-
out by any classroom. The school purchased additional Chromebooks through site, district, grant and 
PTA funds, allowed us to begin banks of Chromebooks which remain in the classroom. All of our classrooms have teacher 
laptop computers, LCD projectors, and document cameras to be used as tools of instruction. Thanks to the Measure J 
Bond, updates in 2019 i
ncluded ceiling mounted projectors, and amplification systems in every classroom. Bandwidth has 
also been increased, facilitating instructional technology use and overall speed and efficiency.
 
 
Education is a top priority in the community of Livermore, and
 
maintaining a safe and orderly environment maximizes 
student learning. The citizens of Livermore have passed three major funding measures targeting school facility needs: 
Measure B in 1975, Measure L in 1999 and, most recently in June 2016, the generous a
nd supportive Livermore community 
passed the Measure J Facilities Bond. Measure J funds will be used to:
 

 
Modernize classrooms, science labs and educational technology for 21st century instruction
 

 
Repair aging infrastructure: roofs, plumbing, HVAC and elect
rical systems
 

 
Renovate facilities for advanced science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and Career Technical 
Education (CTE) courses
 

 
Improve safety, including security lighting, fencing, fire safety, and other emergency systems
 

 
Upgrade deteriorated
 
hardscapes, physical education facilities, and pick
-
up/drop
-
off zones
 

 
Increase access to school facilities to better accommodate individuals with disabilities

Through these bond measures and developer fees, the LVJUSD has been able to renovate, modernize 
and construct new 
schools following the Facilities Master Plan. Facilities are maintained through the diligent efforts of the site custodial cr
ews 
and the district maintenance staff. The LVJUSD Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all scho
ols in the 
LVJUSD.
 
 
The principal works with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to maintain clean and safe schools. District 
maintenance staff performs the repairs necessary to keep the schools in good working order in a timely manner. A wor
k
-
order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California
 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [
ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State St
andards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univer
sity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Educational research s
uggests that highly effective schools have a number of features in common, including high levels of 

high levels and have more well

rounded
 
educational experiences. LVJUSD parents are welcome partners in our school 
community. There are a range of opportunities for parents to engage with schools, including Parent Teacher Associations 
(PTAs), Parent Faculty Associations (PFAs), sports and activ
ity booster clubs, and other supporter groups. On a monthly 

Communication and Information Council (PCIC). This gathering provides an opportu
nity for parent groups to collaborate 
with each other and representatives of the district regarding events, opportunities, and activities for students and families
. 
This is also a time district representatives share new initiatives and current information 
with parent leaders. In addition, 
parents have the opportunity to share general concerns and ask questions directly to the superintendent. Each school also 
has formal advisory groups including School Site Councils (SSCs) and English Learner Advisory Commit
tees (ELACs) who 
represent other parents at the site and are critical in the development and monitoring of the 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement (SPSA). A representative from each SSC serves on the district Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) 
Adviso
ry Committee, and a member of each ELAC serves on the District English Learner Advisory Council (DELAC), which 
also serves as the LCAP English Learner Advisory Committee. Through these two
-
way systems of parent support and 
engagement, parents, district, an
d school staff have open lines of communication and opportunities to engage in 
meaningful ways with the school community.
 
 
Parents are an integral part of our school environment. We have several opportunities for parents to become involved 
and are open to 

learning in a variety of ways. Parents volunteer in classrooms and make many field trips possible by driving and 
chaperoning students. We are proud of the m
ore than 600 parents, grandparents and other family members who sign up 
annually as volunteers at our school.We have an extremely active Parent Teacher Association (PTA) that supports our 
school programs both financially and through volunteer efforts. The 
PTA has been able to support extra personnel hours 

-
annual 
book fair generates funds to expand personal and classroom libraries. Additional
ly, it provides generous donations to each 
classroom to provide additional resources for instruction and enrichment.
 
Questions regarding PTA activities may be answered via email by contacting the PTA president, Alexis VanDewerfhorst, at 
president@crocepta.
com.
 
 
We also have an active School Site Council (SSC). The SSC approves the School Plan for Student Achievement and allocates 
the monies from state and federal funds to support student learning. Parents also participate on our English Learner 
Advisory Com
mittee (ELAC), which provides input and support for school programs. Each year, we host classes for our 
English learner parent community on relevant topics, such as parenting, school success and computer skills.  For more

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The school safety plan, which was 
approved by our School Site Council in February 2019, was last reviewed, updated and 
discussed with the school faculty in August 2019. It is available to the public for review in the school office. The school 
safety plan addresses preparedness and response
 
for a variety of possible disasters such as earthquakes, fires, and 
intruders. We have regular practice drills for all three events. The school maintains emergency supplies, which are stored 
away from the main buildings in an emergency storage container. 
Visitors are all required to sign in and sign out in the 
school office and wear a badge when visiting classrooms. A computerized checkin/ID badge system helps us manage and 
monitor visitors on campus. All LVJUSD school personnel are to wear their district 
identification tags. We post emergency 
first
-
aid information, emergency backpacks, and emergency
-
evacuation maps in every classroom. Yard supervisors 
(wearing orange vests for visibility and equipped with handheld radios) are on campus to provide student s
upervision 
before and after school, and at lunchtime. We have a peanut
-
free table in the lunch areas for students with allergies. All 
yard supervisors and office staff are trained in the use of the epinephrine auto
-
injector in case of an emergency, as well
 
as basic seizure
-
response protocols, and the use of automated defibrillator devices.

Our district recognizes that each employee

classified, certificated and management

influences the opportunities for 
students to achieve at the highest levels. In line 
with our District Professional Development Plan, we offer and support 
ongoing growth opportunities that allow every teacher, administrator, and staff member to further develop the 
appropriate knowledge, skills, and practices required to create learning env
ironments that allow all students to 
demonstrate high levels of achievement. Our Board of Education and our district administration recognize that all staff 
members of the LVJUSD must be provided time and support to acquire, improve, and enhance profession
al knowledge, 
practices, and skills.
 
 
During the 2019
-
2020 school year, relevant and timely professional development will be available and delivered to 
employees. In addition, two designated professional development days and the flexible professional devel
opment day for 
certificated staff provide the option of individualized professional growth for teachers. Professional development will 
primarily focus on effective tier one instruction; Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS), student and staff
 
safety; customer service; meeting the needs of students with Individual Education Plans (IEP); effective usage of 
technology as an instructional tool; effective instructional practices for English learners; and implementation of specialize
d 
programs such 
as Dual Immersion, Project Lead the Way, International Baccalaureate, and Advanced Placement programs.
