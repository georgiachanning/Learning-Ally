Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The

Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative As
sessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate
 
in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who
 
have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Moving from childhood to adulthood is difficult, and students need support 
through those changes.  We know parents are 
a child's first and most important teachers, so we want to work together with parents to support students.  This happens 
in three primary ways:
 
1.  Teacher  Parent communication.  All staff are piloting Class Doj
o as a communication tool with parents.  Class Dojo 
allows teachers to easily show parents the good things students are doing in class.  It also facilitates communication with 
parents when things are not going well in class.  The tool also supports parents
 
sharing concerns and questions with 
teachers.

Led Conferences.  During first quarter, all parents are invited to participate in conferences with the teacher led 
by the student in which the student explains how they earned their grades, what th
ey are proud of, where they are 
struggling, and what support they need to become their best selves.  These conferences run about 30 minutes.  During 
second, third, and fourth quarters, parents can schedule Learner
-
Led conferences with the teacher, but the 
focus will be 
on students who are struggling on campus.
 
3.  The most important thing our parents do to support their students is to talk with them about what is going on at school 
and what students are learning.  The time spent talking about school tells s
tudents that this is something the family values 
and leads students to work hard at learning.
 
 
Parents also participate in the following structured activities:
 
1.
 
Monthly principal coffees.  These include classroom tours, presentations on topics of interest, 
and an open 
question, concern, and answer period.
 
2.
 
School Site Council / English Learner Advisory Committee.  At Mathson these two committees are combined.  They 
have responsibility for reviewing the performance of the school and for authorizing school budg
et.
 
3.
 
Mathson Celebrates!  These happen quarterly to celebrate student academic achievement, attendance, sports & 
music achievement, and general service to the school.
 
4.
 
LCAP meetings are scheduled every year for parents to understand how LCAP funds are alloca
ted and to provide 
input into how they would like to see the funds used.
 
5.
 
Last year, Mathson became a Comprehensive Support & Improvement (CSI) school and parents provided input 
(and as School Site Council approved) how those funds would be spent.

and drill procedures are reviewed during the year with all staff. Safety alerts are shared with all staff as needed throughou

The Mathson School Safety Plan contains a comprehensive, enforceable, and continuous behavior policy, set of rules and 
regulations, dress c
ode policy, protocols for safety/emergency drills, tardy policy, attendance policy, referral policy,
