A Message from the Superintendent
 
The purpose of the School Accountability Report Card is to provide parents with information about our schools and their instr

about our school district, please visit our website at http://www.rosemead.k12.ca.us
 
 
Parents and the community play a very important role in our school

achievement, and curriculum development can assist both the schools and community in ongoing program improvement.  There are 
many 
ways for our parents and our community to get involved such as pa

school and/or in your child's classroom.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The 
SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), whi
ch describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more informat
ion about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Rosemead School District sets a high priority on making high quality textbooks 
and materials available to support instructional programs. Rosemead 
School District held a public hearing and determined that textbooks, instructional materials, and science lab equipment were 
sufficient and of good 
quality at each school within the distri
ct, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are 
given their own  standards
-
aligned textbooks and instructional materials in core subjects for use in the classroom and at home. All textbo
oks and 
instructional materials are aligned with the California State Content Standards and Frameworks and have been approved by the 
Board of Trustees. 
Rosemead School District follows the State Instructional Materials Adoption Cycle that reviews instructi
onal materials in each curricular area within a six
-
year cycle. The chart below illustrates the textbooks currently in use at our school. All textbooks are in adequate supply an
d fair to excellent condition. 
100% of students in each core subject area posse

visit the library on a weekly 
basis with their classes.  The school also 
has a comprehensive leveled library of books for guided reading and English Language Development.  Computers 
at the school are connected to the internet via a high speed connection so that students are able to access resources and inf
ormation on

line and d

their research skills. The school is working to integrate computer skills and concepts across the curriculum. Students in gra

School 
Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Built in 1948, with additions built in 1997, Encinita School facilities encompass 41,437 square feet. They consist of permane
nt and relocatable classrooms, 
a multipurpose room, a library, admi
nistration offices, and restrooms. The school recently renovated all student restrooms and upgraded the 
phone/intercom system allowing for the installation of phones and voice mail in all classrooms. A project to modernize the ad
ministration building and 
t
he second of three phases of a major electrical upgrade was completed September 2007. An upgrade to the computer lab was comp
leted in 2014. The 
facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample classroom and playground space. Facility info
rmation is current as of January 2016. 
Classroom renovations and technology upgrades were completed in 2014.  The school sandboxes were replaced with wood chips in 
2015.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and
 
Operations. District maintenance supervisors are proactive and conduct inspections at 
school sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a t
imely manner. A work order 
process is used t
o ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is 
available at t
he school office 
or at the district office. The site administration team works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to
 
ensure a clean and safe school.

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the

Parents and the community are very supportive of the education program at Encinita School. The PTA has made generous contribu
tions of time and 
money to 
numerous programs and activities. PTA fundraisers enable the school to offer field trips, assemblies, community service proje
cts, identification 
kits, emergency supplies, book fairs, and family nights, as just a few examples.
 
 
Parents are encouraged to be

wide events held 
throughout the school year. Parents are kept abreast of school activities through regular newsletters, Back

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; a
nd
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Encinita School is a closed campus. During school hours, visitors check in with the front office. All visitors are required t
o sign in and to wear visitor badges 
during their stay. While
 
we welcome visits by parents and community members, anyone wishing to be on campus during school hours should notify staff 
ahead of time. During lunch, breaks, and before and after school, yard supervisors and teachers supervise students and school
 
ground
s, including the 
cafeteria and playgrounds, to ensure a safe and orderly environment.
 
 
Additional security measures have also been taken for volunteers who serve on campus.  School volunteers must complete a volu
nteer form, have a 
tuberculosis (TB) 
clearance, as well as fingerprint clearance by the Department of Justice.  The district pays for the cost of TB tests and fin
gerprinting so 
it is not a financial burden on volunteers.
 
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the district to com
ply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The plan provides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. The safe school plan includes the following requirements of SB 1
87: current status of school 
crime, child abuse rep
orting procedures, disaster procedures (routine, and emergency), policies related to suspension and expulsion, notification t
o 
teachers, sexual harassment policy, provision of a school
-
wide dress code, safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and school
 
employees, safe and 
orderly school environment, and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The plan is evaluated by the school annually and updated as needed.  Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School
 
Plan, are reviewed with 
school and district sta
ff throughout the school year during various safety training opportunities and emergency drills.
