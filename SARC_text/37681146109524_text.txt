School Description
 
Live Oak Elementary School has an enrollment of over 650 unique and culturally diverse students 
in Transitional Kindergarten through sixth grade. Our school is situated on a picturesque 12
-
acre 
site located in the southeastern part of Fallbrook, near histo
ric Live Oak Park. Live Oak Elementary 
has an impressive focus on strong academic achievement, student leadership, and meeting the 
needs of all students. Live Oak teachers are reflective, research driven practitioners, that construct 
and use an array of as
sessments, data results, and instructional resources to structure engaging 
learning opportunities for its students in a compassionate, student
-
centered environment. As a 
Franklin Covey Leader in Me Lighthouse School, Live Oak students are engaged, take res
ponsibility 
for their learning, and respect themselves and others in a safe learning environment where high 
standards, leadership goals, and a growth mindset are of greatest priority. We believe in building 
strong relationships with all students and famili
es, and parent involvement is of great importance 
and directly connected to our success at LOE.
 
 
At Live Oak, we practice Positive Behavior Intervention and Support practices (PBIS), and equip our 
students with problem solving skills to support social and 
emotional success. We strive to ensure 
that all of our students will become high school graduates who are self
-
confident and skilled 
citizens, ready to embrace college and career goals through hard work and perseverance. Our 
strong focus on STEM and hands
-
on learning sets us apart from other school districts, and gives our 
students the advantage they need to be contributing members of a global society.  As a professional 
learning community, we have implemented the California State Standards using a common 
i
nstructional framework, while maintaining a needed focus on our English language learners. The 
Live Oak staff remains committed to providing differentiation and individualized learning through 
small group instruction, a focus on best practices, relevant an
d engaging instructional strategies, 
and a strong connection to families and community.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Live Oak Elementary is committed to working with our parents to extend and enrich the school experience for all students. We 
believe in providing 
parents and families with regular communication through our school webs
ite, Peachjar flyers, "all calls," social media feeds, and our weekly 
communication folders. Opportunities for parents to engage in the school are outlined annually in our Parent and Family Engag
ement Plan. We welcome 
parents on our campus and annually off
er a "Meet and Greet" before school begins, a Fall "Back To School Night," student
-
led parent conferences, Coffee 
and Conversation with the Principal, a "Leadership Day," Family STEM events, and a Spring "Open House." We offer a variety of
 
parent volunteer
, 
education, and engagement opportunities at our site. We encourage parents and community members to join the Parent Teacher St
udent Association 
(PTSA), and to participate by attending various school committee meetings such as School Site Council (SSC), En
glish Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) 
and Lighthouse Leadership Meetings. For more information regarding parent involvement opportunities please see the school sit

School Safety Plan
 
Each Fallbrook Union 
Elementary School District site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP), including a disaster preparedness plan 
annually. School administrators work closely with local law enforcement, fire department and/or the Provost Marshall's Office
 
on Cam
p Pendleton who 
review the plans and also participate in emergency drills, provide feedback, attend site and district safety meetings and col
laboratively help to improve 
overall campus safety, climate, and security.  Copies of the Comprehensive School Safe
ty Plans are available for review at each school office. The plan 
includes emergency procedures for school safety, natural disasters, and campus intruders. It also contains appropriate strate
gies and programs that will 
provide or maintain a high level of s

teachers, and staff are trained to prepare for a wide range of emergency situations, and frequent drills help to refine emerg
ency skills, 
policies, and 
procedures at all school sites. Following each drill, specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to co
ntinually improve emergency 
procedures, and improve campus safety.
 
 
Finally, school and district administrators immed
iately investigate threats of harm. Teachers and administrators seek to foster lines of open 
communication so students and parents feel comfortable reporting inappropriate activity including bullying, harassment, or th
reats. All FUESD staff take 
a strong s
tand against threatening behavior or bullying and investigate complaint matters fully. Many positive programs exist districtw
ide to enhance 
and continually improve school culture and climate, including Positive Behavior Intervention and Support, Restorativ
e Practices, Suicide Prevention, Anti
-
Vaping Education and Trauma
-
Informed Practices.
