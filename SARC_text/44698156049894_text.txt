School Description
 
Gault Elementary School is a caring community that fosters respect, values diverse cultures, 
languages, and promotes positive school climate through the use of PBIS. Through a meaningful 
and appropriate curriculum, we work to ensure that all students exper
ience continuous growth in 
academic and social skills in order to become complex thinkers, collaborative learners, and clear 
communicators. We do this through excellence in teaching, parent and community partnership, 
and support from our school district. W
e are a diverse population: 70% Latino, 45% English Learner, 
and 69% Free and Reduced Lunch. We are a relatively small elementary school with approximately 
350 students, 23 certificated teachers, an RTI coordinator, 23 classified support staff, full time 
p
rincipal, bilingual school counselor, bilingual community coordinator and part time social worker. 
We have several programs at Gault that provide students with lifelong learning skills, however it 
has been our work around climate and culture that has made 
a noticeable impact on student 
learning in the classroom.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The main building was built in 1928 and went through extensive remodeling in 2005.  We have a courtyard, which we use for ins
tru
ction and as a gathering 
place for students and parents. The Life Lab garden and science lab is a center in which many lessons and activities take pla
ce. We have a library, which 
is a gathering place for students at lunch and recess as well as a place wher
e lessons are taught to every class on a weekly basis. Additionally we have an 
art and separate music room that provide focused space for the arts weekly for our students. Gault School offers the charm of
 
a historic building filled 
with eager students. We 
passed our 2019 Williams facility audit with a  98%  "good" on the fit report and passed our 2019 safety audit.

glish language 
arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students may participate in the 
administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards 
[CCSS] for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities);
