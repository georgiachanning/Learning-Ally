School Description
 

-
MTSS a multi
-
tiered support
 
system). Through the workshop model we are able to be responsive 
and meet the needs of all our students. With this model of teaching, our Penryn team works 
collaboratively to keep students in the classroom for a majority of the school day. By doing this 
s
tudents are given the same core instruction as all their peers but we can help support with push 
in given through staff in our resource department, again a Multi
-
Tiered Support System (MTSS).
 
 
Penryn is a Positive Behavior Interventions and Support School (PBIS). Positive Behavioral 
Interventions and Supports (PBIS) is a way for schools to encourage good behavior. With PBIS, 
children learn about behavior, just as they learn other subjects like m
ath or science. The key to PBIS 
is prevention, not punishment. We were recognized by the State of California PBIS Coalition for our 
PBIS programming at Penryn School with the Platinum PBIS Implementation Reward for the 4th 
year in a row. We are very proud 
of our PBIS program at Penryn School.
 
 
It is essential that our school fosters a sense of community. We accomplish this with the 
partnerships and collaboration we have with our community, families, students and business 
owners.
 
 
School Mission 
Statement
 
To create 21st century, critical thinking, lifelong learners who are innovative in achieving academic 
excellence, and to nurture the development of responsible citizens in the community by setting 
high expectations and scaffolding to meet the nee
ds of all students.

Abou
t the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the 
Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities
 
to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 5, 2
019 and determined that each school within the district had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of Californ
ia. All students, including 
English learner
s, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the Californi
a Department of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by a
ll teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teache
rs and administrators. All recommended materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

As part of the professional growth process, opportunities for training and staff development are provided at both the 
district and individual school sites 
to administrators, teachers, certificated and classified staff. The district offered five staff development days during the 2
017
-
2018 school year and three 
staff development days during the 2018
-
19 and 2019
-
20 school ye
ars.  During these staff development days staff members are offered professional 
growth opportunities to expand staff knowledge in curriculum, assessment and instructional strategies.
 
 
The last three years Penryn has sent five of their staff members to 
Teacher's College to establish and strengthen our Writers Workshop program at 
Penryn. For the summer of 2018 we sent 5 staff to writing training in L.A., this allowed them to enrich and broaden their uni
ts of study and areas of focus 
for writing and langua
ge arts. We continue to send staff to professional development around writing to enrich our learning and growing with our wri
ting 
program. We also set aside time during our weekly staff meetings to share and review our writing program, this allows us to m
a
ke adjustments to the 
program as needed for students.
 
 
For the 2018
-
2019 school year we are moving our focus now to math. We are finding ways in which we are successful in our writing workshop 
program 
and using those same structures for math.We are spendin
g time collaborating with vertical teams to see what concepts are needed for the following 
years in math. We will look at scope and sequence, foundational concepts and at data, to find the trends, so we can see the c
oncepts students are not 
grasping year a
fter year.
 
 
We are in our sixth year of PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention Supports) program at Penryn. We continue attending professio
nal development for our 
PBIS leadership team through state conferences, booster trainings and district wide professiona
l development.
 
 
With all programs at Penryn we monitor and support our programs through academic conferences (teacher
-
principal meetings), PLC (professional 
learning communities), district wide TOSAs (teachers on special assignment) doing in and out of cla
ss coaching, we also bring consultants in for mentoring 
and coaching with staff.
 
 
For new teachers, the district supports them through the statewide BTSA (beginning teacher support and assessment) program wh
ere they work with an 
expert teacher to help ment
or and guide them through their first two years.
 
 
Currently we have a mentor program where staff mentor students on campus. For the 2018
-
2019 school year we will develop and pilot a peer mentor 
program where 7th and 8th grade students can mentor students i
n the Kinder through 4th grade classes.
