By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

data, and reflective dialogue among our professional colleagues leading to the refinement of research based 
teaching 
strategies and interventions to reach all learners. Our students are accountable for the opportunities that they are 
provided to master the curriculum and are encouraged to feel safe enough to risk, grow, and achieve success as an 
educated, respon

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Since its opening in 1994, Sundown has grown 
considerably with the addition of a number of portable classrooms and an 
additional restroom. At this time, no additional portable units are being added to the site, but space remains to add several
 
more if the need were to arise.
 
 
In addition to the schoo
l description included earlier in this document, Sundown is a safe, clean school.  It is bordered on 
all sides by fencing.  The main building houses the library, main office and cafeteria as well as classrooms.  Speech, RSP, 
and SDC all have their own clas
srooms.  We partner with the YMCA to offer before and after school care on our campus.
 
 
Our school remains a warm, inviting place to come each day for students, staff and parents.  Hallway bulletin boards 
showcase student work and showcases highlight award
s and trophies.  Everyone who is part of the Sundown Community 
collaborates to create a safe, well
-
maintained facility so that our students have the best possible environment for learning.

Council, our site English Language Advisory Council which meets approximately 6 times each school year, school 
committees, and/or as classroom volunteers.  Our PTA remains a strong link 
to our classrooms through their continued 
support of all that is good for children at Sundown. Parent volunteers are a strength here as well, and parents are 
encouraged to be part of our school community.  The West Antelope Valley Education (WAVE) foundati
on also provides 
parental involvement both for Sundown and district wide. Parents are encouraged to attend events held by the PTA. We 
are excited to have parent information sessions for our ELL parents as well as the Latino Literacy project guided by our 
b
ilingual aides to allow parents to be involved at Sundown. AVID parent night and standards based grading presentations 
will be held this year.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-

A range of academic and 
social emotional supports exist for Westside students, many of which are unique to individual 
school sites, tailored to meet the needs of the members of each school community.  Many of these supports are provided 
by counselors (district and/or community
-
ba
sed), school psychologists, school nurses, specialists in 
Speech/Language/Hearing, adaptive physical education teachers, or behavior specialists.
 
 
Student Study and Child Study Teams assist students experiencing academic and/or social emotional challenges,
 
those 
with special needs, and with assessing eligibility for placement in special classes and/or recommending specialized services 
as needed. Special services and classes are offered for students with learning disabilities as well as other students with 
e
xceptional needs.
 
 
Twelve counselors provide a range of support services for Westside students.  Programs and services are developed and 
provided based on student data (such as referrals for threatening or self
-
harm behaviors and academic intervention 
lett
ers) and the needs of the school site.  Often these programs build upon the skills and habits of mind that are nurtured 
and developed in Leadership Development through Physical Education (LDTPE), AVID, and Boys Town.  Examples of 
counseling programs includ
e specific groups for strong
-
willed students, grief groups, groups for students who are 
exhibiting signs and behaviors due to trauma, academic organization groups (addressing academic organization of 
assignments, goals, and expectations), and community out
reach and service clubs such as Student Ambassadors or 
Kindness Club. School counselors are assisted by a cadre of Campus Climate Assistants, highly trained paraprofessionals 
who provide social emotional support and structure for students during more unstr
uctured parts of the school day like 
recess and lunch. Counselors and Educational Service staff members collaborate regularly with community agencies to 
facilitate alignment and coordination of resources and supports for students and their families.
 
 
The d
istrict continues to collaborate with the Department of Mental Health to coordinate with local mental health 
agencies to provide School Based Mental Health services at all school sites for eligible students.
 
 
Behavior specialists provide student and staff 
support for students needing intensive behavior support and/or 
intervention.
 
 
Bilingual paraprofessional support staff provide assistance in the classroom for English Learners. Bilingual assistants 
receive ongoing professional development in the areas of s
trategies to support students learning English within the 
classroom; review of district wide academic programs supporting English Learners; specialized language practice used for 
translation during parent/teacher conferences; protocols for English Learner 
identification; and criteria for student 
reclassification.

Several programs, designed to build students' emotional intelligence and capacity and to promote positive and proactive 
social decision making, reduce bullying, and build an inclusive culture cont
inue to be implemented districtwide. Two of 
these are BoysTown (implemented in grades Kindergarten through 8) and Leadership Development through Physical 
Education for students in grades 4, 5, and 6.
 
 
A variety of online mathematics (i.e. Big Brains and 
ALEKS) and reading intervention (i.e. FastForWord) programs are 
accessible for students.  In addition to being used during the school day, students can also access these programs from 
home.  These online interventions are site
-
specific.
 
 
A variety of exten
ded learning opportunities like before/after school tutoring and/or lunchtime Learning Lab support were 
offered at all sites.  Learning Labs provide support with homework and opportunities for collaborative learning sessions.  
Tutoring may provide review o
f foundational skills, frontloading of key skills and concepts, and/or homework assistance.  
Five days of intersession support is provided for middle school students during each spring and summer intersession.  An 
Extended School Year program is available 
during the first part of summer intersession for those students with disabilities 
who qualify.  A traditional district wide summer school program was on hold for the summer of 2018 due to significant 
maintenance and repairs at school sites. In lieu of the 
summer school program for elementary students, optional 
interactive Summer Learning Kits were purchased for parents and caregivers to use with their students over the summer 
intersession. The Kits contained games, tools, and materials to sharpen and suppor
t reading, writing, and math skills.  
Additionally, the district offered its third summer KinderCamp during the summer.  The three
-
day experience was designed 
to provide an opportunity for incoming Kindergarteners and their parents to learn about Kindergar
ten expectations in a 
day camp

type environment.

The goal of professional learning is to provide staff members the support that they need to meet the diverse educational 
needs of Westside students. The key area of focus for professional development and suppo
rt for the 2018

2019 school 
year was the use of assessment data, particularly common formative assessment data, to guide and inform instruction.
 
 
Teachers, classified instructional classroom support staff, and site administrators are provided four days of 
professional 
development each year. These days are calendared work days.  For all groups, two of the days are dedicated to issues and 
needs related specifically to our English Learners, foster youth, or other at
-
risk students.  For teachers and site 
admini
strators, two of the four days are devoted to building their capacity to use data, particularly formative assessment 
data, to inform instruction.  For classified instructional staff, two days were devoted a to a variety of topics including 
trauma
-
informed 
support for at
-
risk youth; BoysTown; Leadership Development through Physical Education; and meeting 
the academic needs of students with exceptional needs.
 
 
Teachers are also encouraged to engage in optional professional learning opportunities that relate t
o their specific 
teaching assignment. Teachers are compensated at a contractual hourly rate for their participation in these sessions.

district has developed a robust system for new teacher support including 1:1 support, Professional Learning 
Communities 
(PLCs), and direct classroom support. New teachers are assigned a mentor/coach dependent upon their credential status. 
Support providers, mentors, and coaches in the program are veteran teachers who have been released full
-
time from their 
class
room responsibilities.  Every new teacher is supported weekly at their site by their mentor/coach with the focus of 
support being aligned to their goal and individual support plan.  Full time administrators/coaches also support the pre
-
interns and interns 
based upon the requirements of their university's memorandum of understanding and the 
requirements of the CTC.  The pre
-
intern and intern teachers participate in biweekly professional development based 
upon the district initiatives as well as their unique 
developmental needs.  Teachers holding a Preliminary credential are 
supported by teachers on special assignment who serve as full time Support Providers.  Those holding a Preliminary 
credential attend a series of six professional development opportunities 
specially designed and aligned with the California 
Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTPs). For veteran teachers needing additional support, the Peer Assistance and 
Review (PAR) program is designed to improve the education of students by providing op
portunities for additional training 
for all teachers.
