About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Dry Creek Joint Elementary School District held a Public Hearing on September 19, 
2019, and determined that each school within the District has sufficient 
and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the 
State of California. All 
students, including English learn
ers, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for 
use in the classroom and to take home. In grades 6
-
8 each student receives a textbook available to keep at home and has a class set of
 
textbooks to use 
at school. Online access to textbooks is also an available option for mathematics, English Language Arts/English Language Dev
elopment (ELA/ELD), and 
History Social
-
Science in grades kindergarten through eight. Instructional materials are 
adopted according to a cycle developed by the State Department 
of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are
 
reviewed by all teachers 
and a recommendation is made to the School
 
Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are 
available for parent examination at each school site, the district office, and in some cases online prior to adoption. The ta
ble displays information abo
ut 
the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used in the school.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Creekview Ranch School was originally constructed in 2008 as a middle school. In 2014, Creekview Ranch opened as a K
-
8 school and is comprised of 38 
classrooms, 1 gym, 1 multipurpose room/cafeteria, 1 
library, 1 staff lounge, and 2 computer labs. Cleaning Process: The principal works daily with the 
custodial staff of 6 (4 full
-
time and 2 part
-
time) to ensure that the cleaning of the school is maintained to provide for a clean and safe school.
 
 
The distr
ict governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available
 
at the district office 
for review.    Maintenance and Repair District maintenance staff ensure that the repairs necessary to keep 
the school in good repair and work orders are 
completed in a timely manner.
 
 
All facilities are regularly inspected by an administrator and the lead custodian to ensure all facilities are well maintaine
d, clean and safe for our students. 
Although student g
rowth is on the rise, we have maintained proper facilities to accommodate our academic needs school
-
wide. All school grounds are 
monitored by campus supervisors during, before and after school hours, as well as by teachers and administration before and a
ft
er school, to ensure 
student safety. All campus supervisors are trained and assigned specific locations to monitor. Our school strictly enforces o
ur school visitor pass and 
employee identification badge requirements.
 
 
The district takes great efforts to en
sure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. District maintenance ensures that the repairs necessary to keep 
the school sites in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure ef
ficient serv
ice and that 
emergency repairs are given the highest priority.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

ulated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus th
e total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or
 
less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not;
 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

Pupil
 
suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Creekview Ranch K
-
8 School. The school is always in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations 
pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The School Site Safety plan was last
 
reviewed on February 21, 2019. All revisions were 
communicated to both the classified and certificated staff. The annual review is scheduled for February 2020 including a cons
ultation with the local police 
department contact for a review of the school's s

during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year.  Lockdown drills are
 
held at a minimum of two 
times a year.
 
 
Throughout the year, a number of initiatives, assemblies, and ongoing programs educate students about bullying and ensuring a
 
positive campus 
environment. School goals are written to monitor and assess the school's positive 
environment. Staff, counselors, and administrators provide student 
services that enable students to have a connection to a caring adult on campus. Students are supervised before and after scho
ol by certificated 
staff/administration. During the school day, 
a well trained and informed team of campus supervisors monitor students during lunch and recesses.  There 
is a designated area for student drop off and pick up. Visitors are to report to the administration office, sign in, and rece
ive a visitor label using
 
the Raptor 
Visitor System before proceeding onto campus.  In addition, all visitors who volunteer in classrooms complete a Volunteer App
lication that is review by 
site administration.
