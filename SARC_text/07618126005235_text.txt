By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 23, 2019
 
 
The state of California requires that each child have a current standards
-
based textbook in each of the four core areas of 
instruction. As a part of this requirement, Walnut Creek School District has purchased editions for teaching lang
uage arts 
(reading, writing, speaking and listening), science, social science, mathematics and health. We are fortunate to have a 
music text (K
-
5) for our students and a music specialist who meets with all of the classes. Our foreign
-
language texts are 
als
o up
-
to
-
date. Thus, all textbooks in the Walnut Creek School District are current, standards
-
based, and consistent with 
the content and cycles of the Curriculum Frameworks and adopted and approved by the State Board of Education.
 
 
We have an abundance of s
upplementary reading materials at varying levels of difficulty in each of our elementary 
classrooms that are integrated across all core curricular areas. These leveled reading materials provide students with 
experiences in reading narrative as well as expo
sitory text.
 
 
The Walnut Creek School District governing board held a public hearing on September 23, 2019 and affirmed that each 
pupil, including English learners, has his or her own textbook to use in class and to take home.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Walnut Creek Intermediate opened in 1955. There are 52 classrooms, a multiuse room, a gymnasium, a library and a main 
office. There is a weight room, two computer labs and athletic fields. The school
 
is cleaned daily by 4.5 custodians. If 
repairs need to be made on the facility, there is a web
-
based ticket system, where any staff member can create a ticket 
indicating a repair needs to be made. There are sufficient spaces to support teaching and learni
ng. The maintenance 
warehouse is adjacent to the school, and the maintenance crew is at the school on a regular basis. Before and after school, 
teachers have supervision duty at critical points around the school to ensure students are safe. During lunch, s
tudents are 
only allowed to be in the library or on the west side of the campus. Three administrators, a campus supervisor, and two 
counselors supervise during the lunchtimes as often as they are available.

In June 2016, a $60 million bond was passed for 
the Walnut Creek School District to modernize and improve the seven 
schools that are in the district. As a result, repairs were made immediately to critical issues, such as the driveway and the
 
sewer lines. The master planning process for this started in O
ctober 2016. We anticipate continued improvements and 
modernization as the master plan will identify.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Walnut Creek 
Intermediate, we expect all students will have the opportunity to attend school in a safe and orderly 
learning environment. Our expectations are that students conduct themselves in a responsible manner that does not 
jeopardize the safety or interfere with 
the safety and/or learning of other students. Our hope is that students enjoy 
themselves and become involved in healthy and productive interactions with their peers.
 
 
In addition to the principal, campus supervision is performed by the assistant principals
, one full
-
time counselor, one part
-
time school counselor and one part
-
time campus supervisor. This team maintains a safe and orderly environment during 
both lunch periods along with parent volunteers. Teachers assist with campus monitoring during morning 
drop
-
off and 
afternoon pickup times.
 
 
Through a partnership with the city of Walnut Creek, the school employs one part
-
time crisis counselor who works directly 
with at
-
risk students. Students who break school rules receive counseling and are subject to pro
gressive disciplinary 
actions. Communication with parents and students help to maintain a safe and orderly campus environment. The school 
maintains an excellent relationship with the Walnut Creek Police Department and communicates regularly with the school
 
resource officer. For the 2019
-
20 school year, the City of Walnut Creek has provided a full
-
time school resource officer 
that shares time with the Walnut Creek School District and Las Lomas High School.

All professional growth is determined by both school site and district strategic planning process, which is ongoing 
throughout the school year and culminates with an update in the spring of each year. 
Planning teams include all school 
and community stakeholders, and the work is based on site
-
needs assessments. Input from all school and community 
stakeholders is collected during the planning process and is used to develop the district Local Control and A
ccountability 
Plan (LCAP).
 
 
For 2019
-
2020, the district focus will be on the implementation of the recently adopted math programs at both the K
-
5 
and 6
-

tion to 
identifying the implementation of Common Core State Standards for professional growth in the district LCAP, other areas 
for professional development identified in the district LCAP are: Technology Integration, English Language Development 
(ELD) ins
tructional strategies and Silicon Valley Mathematics Initiative (SVMI) training.
 
 

identifies goals for supporting the district focus, staff 
members meet by grade level or departments to study student 
assessment data or student behaviors and determine how to improve instruction through research and effective 
pedagogy. Weekly collaboration time is provided for all TK
-
8 teachers. Instructional co
aches provide individual student
-
centered coaching cycles and participate in grade
-
level and department meetings to support professional growth.
 
 
Individual teachers and administrators keep their skills current by researching about learning, attending work
shops and 
classes and reading on their own. Some examples are attendance at various conferences: Teachers College Reading and 
Writing Project, ISTE, PBL World, SVMI, Middle School Conference, Socratic Seminar, Reading Recovery, and technology. 
Teachers att
end training sessions in differentiated instruction, special education, Next Generation Science Standards 
(NGSS) and in all core curricular areas. Beginning teachers participate in a two
-
year induction program with a mentor who 
is trained through the Contr
a Costa County Office of Education Teacher Induction Program.
 
 
We continue to provide four days each school year that are dedicated to staff and professional development. The district 
ensures the agendas for these professional growth days are tied to areas
 
defined by the strategic plan and LCAP.
