School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report
 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountabilit
y Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF o
r LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
p
rincipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Mission and Vision:
 
We see greatness and potential in every student, family, and community.
 
 
Our students will be prepa
red to thrive in the global economy as they develop critical thinking skills and deep conceptual 
knowledge through academically challenging courses. Through a rigorous literacy program, students write and tell their 
stories, as well as listen to the storie
s of others with compassion. As our students master skills and content necessary to 
be successful in college and life, they will learn to advocate for themselves and their communities with humility and clarity
.
 
 
At KIPP Heritage Academy, we embrace our his
tories as we build a brighter future in East San Jose and beyond. Equipped 
with this strong foundation of knowledge, skills, and character, KIPP Heritage students will be agents of positive change, 
empowered as authors of their own lives.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and 
each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At KIPP, constant communication between the school and home are encouraged and facilitated. Parents are involved in 
planned parent nights as well as parent/teacher conference

strategies to support their child at home. By staying committed to open communication with the parents, it helps provide 
the proper support that KIPP students need in order for them to be successful.
 
 
In an effort to develop the best possible relationships with the community that we serve, we supply all of our teachers 
with cellular phones in order to maintain open communication with families. On the first day of school, parents will be 
given the cell
ular phone number of all staff members and will be encouraged to use it whenever they need clarification

Parents participate in family meetings to receive training o

writing and mathematical skills at home, as well as financial planning sessions. Parents are engaged annually regarding 

nd the Local Control and Accountability Plan. 
Other opportunities for parent involvement include newsletters, local field trips and end of year trips, and fun events such 
as picnics and dances.
 
 
KIPP's School Site Council (SSC) reviewed and approved both a
 
Parent Compact and Parent Engagement Policy that was 
distributed to all students, student families and staff. These documents will be reviewed annually by the elected council 
to ensure that the policies are aligned with the needs at the school.

At KIPP, the School Leader sets the tone and develop the conditions under which staff members become the keepers of 

a positive campu
s culture, sharing the best instructional practices, and encouraging individual teacher growth.
 
 
Beginning in staff orientation before school begins, the School Leader ensures that teachers fully understand and support 

c values, emphasizing a rigorous, standards
-
based college preparatory program. This 
orientation involves specific activities designed to align the staff and foster teamwork and constant learning while allowing
 
staff to understand the detailed intricacies o
f the school culture. As part of the learning and team

building process, staff 

 
includes workshops around data
