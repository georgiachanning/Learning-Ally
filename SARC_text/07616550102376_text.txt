About the SARC
 
By February 1 
of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding For
mula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and loc
al priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of
 
Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Brentwood Union Elementary held a public hearing on Sept. 11, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had s
ufficient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or scie
nce lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the 
classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the St
ate are reviewed by all teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. The
 
table displays information collected in Sept. 11, 2019 about the quality, 
currency, and availability of the standards

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a 
primary concern of the Brentwood Union School District.  The district and schools are in compliance with all laws, rules, 
and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The School Site Safety plan was last review
ed and up
dated 3/1/2019 
by the School Safety Committee. All revisions were communicated to the both the classified and certificated staff.  The schoo

plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disa
ster drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school 
year.  Lockdown and Lockout drills are held twice a year. Students are supervised before and after school and during lunch by
 
certificated and classified 
staff and the principal. Parent vol
unteers help with supervision during lunch and break periods. There is a designated area for student drop off and pick 
up. All visitors are required to check in at the office upon arrival and before departing from the school campus.  Visitor ba
dges are iss
ued at the time of 
check
-
in and are to be worn throughout the visit.  All visitors are scanned by our Raptor Visitor system.
 
 
Discipline & Climate for Learning
 

mate.  District Goal#4 States: All student will have a safe 
school culture, climate and learning environment in order to support student physical, mental and emotional health.  All site

practices for character education, bullying pre
vention, diversity appreciation programs, and social media education.  In addition, students in the 
Brentwood Union Elementary School District are guided by specific rules and classroom expectations that promote respect, coop
eration, courtesy and 
acceptanc
