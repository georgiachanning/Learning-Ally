Kearney (H
-
K) Elementary School is a
 
vibrant school and an exciting place to be, both 
steeped in tradition and moving towards a great future. We strive for every student to be prepared 
for success in college, career, and community. Houghton
-
Kearney Elementary School, with an 
attendance area 
of approximately 40 square miles, lies in a rural setting. The school has an 
enrollment of approximately 215 students. Seventy percent of our students are classified as 
Socioeconomically Disadvantaged. The area is fairly stable, with a small number of stud
ents coming 
from migrant farm labor. The transient population has approximately the same ethnic makeup as 
the regular school population. The school has always been the hub of the local community as there 
is not a town nearby.  H
-
K is steeped with tradition
 
with many children and grandchildren of former 
students attending. One of our major strengths is the involvement of parents in our educational 
system. The Houghton
-
Kearney Community Club, School Site Council, and English Learner Advisory 
Council are all v
ery supportive, involved, and share the vision that each child is prepared for 
success.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Central Unified Schools maintain current and standards
-
aligned inst
ructional materials in good repair, for all students. Materials are locally adopted and 
reflect programs currently approved by the State Board of Education. All materials currently adopted reflect the most recent 
SBE adoptions and support 
the current Calif
ornia Frameworks.
 
 
Every student, including English Learners, Special Education, and other special populations have their own textbook. In the c
ase of class sets, those sets 
augment individual texts that have been issued to individual students. These class
 
sets are made based on a commitment of the district administration 
and the governing board and are not the product of any state requirement.
 
 
All instructional materials are subject to a school and district review process. Materials may be piloted and all
 
materials that are selected and 
recommended for local adoption are reviewed by teachers, administration, and any parents who wish to review the materials. Th
e Central Unified Board 
of Trustees reviews and adopt based on the recommendation of the district 
adoption committees and Educational Services.

Kearney sits on 9 acres and 30,886 square feet. It contains 16 classrooms at 15,880 sq ft and 7 restrooms at 751 sq 
ft. The oldest main building 
was built in 1951. The table below shows the results of the school's most recent inspection using the Facility Inspection Too
l (FIT).  This inspection 
determines the school facility's good repair status. District maintenance st
aff ensures that repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and work 
orders are completed in a timely manner.  For all items inspected that were found to not be in 'good repair', work orders hav
e been created and 
maintenance will be done before th
e end of the 2019
-
20 school year.  Maintenance items will be prioritized so that student safety is not compromised. 
The overall rating for this school is 'fair'.

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessme
nts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards,
 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the

School Safety Plan
 
The Site Emergency Response Plan is updated and aligned with the district plan every year. Relevant names, roles, and contact
 
information are kept 
current. The plan is presented and 
reviewed at a staff meeting at the beginning of the year and monitored as needed. Each room has a comprehensive 
safety plan. Rooms are equipped with land
-
line phones, disaster code posters, evacuation routes (posted), two
-
way radios and portable first aid 
kits. 
Drills are also conducted every month.  The latest Site Emergency Response Plan was approved at the School Site Council on 09

was discussed on November 13, 2019, with staff members. Surveillance cameras are installed at the 
site.

Each semester teachers participate in Professional Learning Communities (PLCs). In addition,
 
our teachers meet twice monthly as a staff, to assist in the 
training to practice the transition of learning.   Special education, instructional coaches, GATE staff, and District Office 
staff, are always invited and 
encouraged to attend if schedules permi
t. Each of these professional development areas and training has been selected based upon student/school need 
and what research has proven to be most effective. Teachers also meet in collaborative groups during  PLCs to utilize student
 
performance data to 
diagnose strength and growth areas and address the needs and professionally develop as the data suggests. PLCs are facilitate
d by the site's instructional 
coach, GIA, and principal. In addition,  ongoing instructional supervision by site administration inc
ludes classroom observations and timely feedback to 
ensure accountability and reflection of first best instruction and tiered interventions. After school personnel and paraprofe
ssionals are also included in 
the training to build their capacity and support 
for the overall Houghton
