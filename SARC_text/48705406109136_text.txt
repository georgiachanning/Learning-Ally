The

great
 
efforts
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
all
 
schools
 
are
 
clean,
 
safe,
 
and
 
functional
 
for
 
our
 
high

standards.
  
This
 
is
 
achieved
 
by
 
custodial
 
staff
 
adhering
 
to
 
district-wide
 
cleaning
 
standards.
  
In
 
addition,
 
a
 
work
 
order

was
 
developed
 
to
 
make
 
certain
 
that
 
timely

that

$9.7
 
million
 
has
 
been
 
allocated
 
to
 
provide
 
a

gymnasium.
  
In
 
addition,

funds
 
have
 
been
 
identified
 
to
 
expand
 
the

and
 
install

These

At

parent
 
involvement
 
is
 
both
 
welcomed
 
and

they
 
help
 
shape
 
the

The

requires
 
safety
 
plans
 
for
 
each

BP3515,

The
 
Governing

insists
 
that
 
students
 
and
 
staff
 
have
 
the
 
right
 
to
 
a
 
safe
 
and
 
secure
 
campus
 
where
 
they
 
are
 
free
 
from
 
physical
 
and
 
psychological
 
harm.
 
The
 
Board
 
is
 
fully
 
committed
 
to
 
maximizing
 
school
 
safety
 
and
 
to
 
creating
 
a
 
positive
 
learning
 
environment
 
that
 
teaches
 
violence
 
prevention
 
and
 
emphasizes
 
high
 
expectations
 
for
 
student
 
achievement,
 
responsible
 
behavior
 
and
 
respect
 
for
 
others.
 
Each
 
school
 
site
 
develops
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
school
 
wide
 
safety
 
plan
 
that
 
includes
 
violence
 
prevention
 
strategies
 
and
 
actions
 
to
 
be
 
taken
 
in
 
the
 
event
 
of
 
a
 
crisis.
 
Each
 
plan
 
is
 
tailored
 
to
 
the
 
specific
 
conditions
 
at
 
the
 
school.
 
Each
 
school
 
plan
 
takes
 
into
 
account
 
the
 
expertise,
 
available
 
resources
 
and
 
building
 
design,
 
along
 
with
 
factors
 
unique
 
to
 
each
 
site.
 
A
 
copy
 
of
 
the
 
school's

is
 
available
 
at
 
the

The

is

at
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
each
 
school
 
year
 
by
 
the

with
 
the
