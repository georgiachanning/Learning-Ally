The
 
school
 
also
 
maintains
 
a
 
positive
 
school
 
culture
 
and
 
atmosphere
 
through
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
many
 
positive
 
behavior
 
rewards,
 
recognition
 
and
 
school
 
wide
 
behavior
 
expectations.
 
We
 
also
 
have
 
monthly
 
behavior
 
themes
 
that
 
promote

and
 
conduct

Fair
 
Oaks
 
staff
 
knows
 
that
 
teaching
 
children
 
how
 
to
 
be
 
students
 
is
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
job
 
of
 
being
 
a
 
teacher
 
and
 
our
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
have
 
happy
 
and
 
motivated
 
learners
 
that
 
feel
 
safe
 
and
 
secure.
 
We
 
also
 
engage
 
parents
 
to
 
reinforce
 
a
 
common
 
understanding
 
of
 
behavior
 
expectations
 
with
 
our
 
families.

The

coordinates
 
various
 
staff
 
development
 
programs
 
for
 
teachers
 
and
 
administrators
 
based
 
on
 
assessed
 
needs
 
and
 
state
 
mandates.
 
The
 
first
 
two
 
days
 
prior
 
to
 
students
 
returning
 
to
 
school
 
in
 
August
 
are
 
devoted
 
to
 
staff
 
development
 
and
 
planning
 
instruction
 
for
 
the
 
school
 
year.
 
Teachers
 
are
 
encouraged
 
to
 
attend
 
workshops
 
and
 
conferences
 
both
 
offered
 
by
 
the
 
district
 
and
 
those
 
offered
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
district.
 
Many
 
are
 
taking
 
courses
 
on
 
effective
 
ways
 
to
 
collect
 
data,
 
useful
 
techniques
 
for
 
engaging
 
students
 
and
 
teaching
 
mathematics.
 
Teachers
 
are
 
provided
 
with
 
regular
 
grade
 
level
 
meeting
 
times
 
and
 
release
 
days
 
to
 
review
 
and
 
analyze
 
student
 
data
 
from
 
multiple
 
sources,
 
including
 
the
 
OARS
 
student
 
information
 
system,
 
and
 
use
 
the
 
results
 
of
 
this
 
analysis
 
to
 
inform
 
and
 
drive
 
instruction.
 
 
The
 
teaching
 
staff
 
participates
 
in
 
monthly
 
professional
 
development
 
to
 
learn
 
how
 
to
 
implement
 
the
 
district's
 
priority
 
standards
 
and
 
to
 
make
 
and
 
study
 
results
 
from
 
new
 
assessments.
 
The
 
shift
 
is
 
mainly
 
focused
 
on
 
engaging
 
students
 
in
 
"21st
 
Century
 
Leaning"
 
in
 
ways
 
that
 
will
 
increase
 
students'
 
abilities
 
to
 
read
 
higher
 
level
 
text,
 
think
 
critically,
 
and
 
apply
 
what
 
they
 
now
 
in
 
collaborative
 
real
 
world
 
situations
 
and
 
to
 
apply
 
the
 
ideas
 
expressed
 
in
 
the
 
Standards
 
for
 
Mathematical
 
Practice.
 
The
 
district
 
has
 
created
 
"Scope
 
and
 
Sequences"
 
for
 
both
 
ELA
 
and
 
Math
 
and
 
has
 
implemented
 
a
 
trimester
 
"Writing
 
Assignment"
 
to
 
guide
 
instruction
 
in
 
each
 
of
 
those
 
areas.
 
The
 
district
 
has
 
supported
 
site
 
needs
 
by
 
creating
 
a
 
PD
 
structure
 
that
 
brings
 
together
 
teachers
 
from
 
multiple
 
sites
 
three
 
times
 
per
 
year
 
(student
 
release
 
days)
 
to
 
provide
 
consistent
 
district
 
wide
 
staff
 
development
 
on
 
the
 
focus
 
standards.
 
Sites
 
are
 
given
 
support
 
by
 
district
 
coaches
 
who
 
plan
 
and
 
help
 
lead
 
PD
 
at
 
the
 
school
 
site
 
level,
 
usually
 
on
 
early
 
release
 
Wednesdays.
 
Staff
 
site
 
PD
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
be
 
engaging
 
and
 
facilitate
 
teacher
 
discussion
 
and
 
interactive
 
opportunities.
 
All
 
grade
 
levels
 
also
 
have
 
grade
 
level
 
PLC
 
meetings
 
a
 
minimum
 
of
 
twice
 
per
 
month.
