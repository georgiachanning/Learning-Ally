School Description
 
Welcome to Ardenwood Elementary School. Ardenwood Elementary is the proud home of the 
Dragons. This School Accountability Report Card shares with the community our efforts to meet 
our district's missio
n of ensuring that all students are college/career ready and develop essential 
skills to succeed in life. Each day we aim to support the development of the essential skills described 
in the Portrait of a Fremont Graduate project. Ardenwood Elementary is an
 
excellent school and 
was honored to be acknowledged as a California Distinguished School in 2010, 2014 and again in 
2018. Our school cultural norms are to have every child feel valued, connected and recognized even 
though our large student body is compose
d of over 900 transitional kindergarten through sixth 
grade students. 
 
 
We are an academically high
-
achieving school with a diverse student body. Ardenwood 
Elementary's results for the 2019 California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress 
(CAASPP) were excellent, especially in comparison to all California districts. Approximately eighty
-
five percent of our students met or exceeded grade level standards on both English Language Arts 
and Mathematics tests. This performance mirrors the success
 
that our students have demonstrated 
with continued high scores since Common Core State Standards aligned assessments became 
available to California public schools through the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC).
 
 
Our student body includes pupils
 
from around the world; with over 35 languages spoken by the 
families in our learning community. We believe that every student has the right to learn in a warm, 
caring, safe, and productive environment. All students receive specific character education les
sons 
(8 Great Traits) and our school
-
wide focus on being Safe, Responsible, and Respectful. This program 
reduces negative interactions between students and increases class time available for instruction. 
All students, teachers, and staff sign a school
-
wide
 
pledge to adhere to our Students of Character 
plan the focuses on demonstrating caring, honesty, respect, integrity, planning and decision 
making, responsibility, citizenship, and problem solving. Ardenwood Elementary School views 
discipline as explicit i
nstruction that corrects or perfects behavior, and it is our belief that clearly 
stated expectations by adults sustains a positive school climate. Students receive positive behavior 
and decision making acknowledgement and reinforcement through our Dragon D
ollars program. 
To stay up to date with many of the great aspects of our school, please visit our website 
(ardenwood.fremont.k12.ca.us) or follow us on Twitter (twitter.com/ArdenwoodFUSD).
 
 
VISION STATEMENT:
 
To promote a school climate where all students a
re provided the maximum opportunity to learn 
and thrive while achieving academic success and building respect for diversity and community.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have
 
enough books in core classes for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of 
Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Ardenwood Elementary school was established in 1985 and is located on land that is owned by the City of Fremont.  Through a J
oint Use Agreement, the 
Fremont Unified School District and the City of Frem
ont have entered into a partnership on the use of the school facilities and adjacent Deep Creek Park.  
The current campus configuration provides a quality and safe educational environment for over 900 students from transitional 
kindergarten through 6th 
gra
de.  There are a range of learning facilities on campus, including but not limited to science labs, a computer lab, music lab
, library, resource learning 
center, and a multi
-
purpose room.  The campus is maintained by a daytime head custodian and three even
ing custodians.  Student areas are cleaned on 
a daily/nightly basis, including all classrooms and restrooms.
 
 
The last major construction on campus took place in 2009, when various maintenance projects to existing structures were compl
eted (HVAC, roofing, 
electrical upgrades) as well as the construction of a 2
-
story building and neighboring wing (15 classrooms, 2 restrooms, and 2 support personnel offices). 
During this time additional gates were installed on campus allowing for the interior of the facility 
to be locked during non
-
instructional hours to deter 
vandalism and other potential misuse.  In 2016, two play areas on campus were updated, including a soft
-
surface play area for our kindergarten classes.  
In 2018, the elevator for the two
-
story building u
nderwent an electrical upgrade and operates up to 2018 code.  Also in 2018 an doubled
-
sided electronic 
marquee was installed at the front of the school which has been helpful in communicating school information to the public.
 
 
The site continues to undergo
 
periodic technological upgrades with the rolling installation of ceiling mounted projectors in classrooms.  In 2019 all 
classrooms and office spaces transitioned to a voice over internet protocol (VoIP) phone system as well as a new clock/speake
r system. 
 
The new 
clock/speaker system allows for greater clarity in announcements as well as makes use of pre
-
programmed response messages in the event of an 
emergency.  Three large conifers have been removed from the adjacent Deep Creek park over the last two yea
rs due to the effect of previous drought 
years.  The landscaping within the school continues to be used as an instructional tool, and Ardenwood was recently named a M
onarch Waystation by 
monarchwatch.org for providing milkweeds, nectar sources, and shelter
 
needed to sustain monarch butterflies as they migrate through California.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection Tool, whic

report. 
Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report. Since that time, tho
se conditions may have changed.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Ardenwood Elementary firmly believes in the importance of a strong school
-
to
-
home partnership.  Students achieve at higher levels when they are 
supported by a coordinat
ed effort between school staff and family members.  To that end, Ardenwood Elementary has many great opportunities for 
parents to be involved  in our school.  We desire parents to participate in the daily prioritization of their child's educati
on by offeri
ng involvement 
opportunities that range from casual classroom support to shared vision and planning committees.  Our school's Parent Teacher
 
Association (PTA) plays 
a significant role in coordinating events for students and families (Red Ribbon Week, Harve
st Festival, Dragon Dash, movie night) and by providing 
appreciation events for faculty and staff.  The PTA funds school
-
wide assemblies and assists with our award winning Dragon Readers program, which for 
18 years has successfully increased our students' 
interest in recreational reading.  In addition to historically establish partnership opportunities, the 
school continues to generate new and fun ways for parents to strengthen their school
-
to
-
home partnership (i.e., Dragon Dollar Store and Pi Day 
Celebrati
on).  For more information on how to join Ardenwood Elementary's PTA, please visit ardenwood.fremont.k12.ca.us.
 
 
Parents are highly encouraged to volunteer at school.  When parents volunteer at school, this sends an important message to s
tudents that schoo
l is a 
high priority.  "Room parents," in collaboration with classroom teachers, organize parent volunteers to help with special pro
jects in the classroom and 
chaperone on study trips.  Parents participate as group facilitators during class projects, shelv
e books in our library, assist with traffic supervision, mentor 
after school coding clubs, and volunteer with our school choir.  Parents interested in routine and ongoing planning conversat
ions are encouraged to 
become involved in the School Site Council (
SSC) which oversees our School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA).  The SSC focuses on curriculum and 
instruction, and works to support equitable outcomes for all of Ardenwood's students.  The English Language Advisory Committe
e (ELAC) addresses the 
needs
 
of second language learners.  Parents are active members of our Disaster Safety Committee.  Statistics for the 2018

2019 school year show a high 
level of parent involvement at the annual autumn Back

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspensi
on rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
School safety is of paramount importance to all staff at Ardenwood Elementary.  When students feel safe at school, they can f
ocus on 
learning.  Custodial 
staff starts every day by organizing traffic safety patterns and cones in front of the school for student drop
-
off.  Certificated staff monitor the school 
grounds ten minutes before and twenty minutes after school, at campus entrance/e
xit locations.  Recesses and lunchtime are supervised by both 
certificated staff and noon supervisors.  During these times, staff monitors for the physical safety of students as well as r
einforcing good decision making 
by our students so that they are safe
, respectful and responsible at all times.
 
 
Teachers regularly review the rules for safe, responsible behavior in school and on the playground with their classes. All st
udents and parents receive a 
copy of The Ardenwood Students of Character Plan at the st
art of the school.  Students, parents, and staff collectively sign this contract so that all 
members of our school community commit to the same set of expectations.  Recognition is a key component to our school
-
wide safety plan, and students 
are given mont
hly awards for exemplar demonstration of the Eight Great Traits.
 
 
When visitors arrive on campus, they are directed to enter and exit the through the front office, signing in and out for the 
time they are on campus.  They 
receive a visible identification s

incidents.  Additional periodic safety information is shared with students and parents through monthly newsletters from the f
ront office.
  
The majority 
of our certificated staff received CPR, AED, and EpiPen training in October of 2018.
 
 
In May 2019 the site completed an annual review and update of its Comprehensive School Safety Plan (SB 187 Compliance Documen
t), during which key 
information on site response protocols, mandated reporting procedures, and facility maintenance needs were discussed.  The si
te completed a major 
review and revision of its local Emergency Response plan in October 2019.  This process solicited feedback fro
m multiple stakeholder groups (staff, 
parents, School Site Council, PTA).  In June of 2019, the school took inventory of its emergency shed and equipment.  Through
 
the assistance of community 
volunteers, this shed was reorganized to place resources needed 
for immediate emergency response at the front of the shed and items used for more 
long
-
term response situations towards the rear.  All grade
-
levels are provided with "ready to roll" emergency response wagons with the shed and all 
classrooms have received r
efreshed emergency "go bags."  The site now makes use of a standardized Incident Command System (ICS) for all emergency 
response situations.  Staff has received additional training on their roles and responsibilities.  This information is to be 
presented a
s an update to our 
school families during a parent outreach night scheduled for December 2019.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their 
knowledge of the subjects they teach.  Below is the amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
2017
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year
, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations these days are sometimes reduced.
