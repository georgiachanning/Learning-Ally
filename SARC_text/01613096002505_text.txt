By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report
 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountabilit
y Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF o
r LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
p
rincipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP]
 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight
 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant co
gnitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or program
s 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Bay prides itself on providing all students and staff with a safe, clean, and orderly environment. All staff members are 
provided 
a copy of the Safety Plan at the beginning of each school year that contains evacuation routes, procedures for 
fire and earthquake drills, as well as individual responsibilities and job descriptions, should an emergency occur. Revisions
 
and updates are don
e yearly during the first two months of school.
 
 
Designated areas of the school have been selected to serve as the command post, medical treatment center, shelter space, 
and communication center. Emergency supplies are located in a safe container, and a pr
ocess for removing and setting 
up emergency supplies has been planned, discussed, and practiced. Plans for the recovery of students during and after 
the emergency are in place. With the help of the PTA, Bay continues to upgrade its medical, food, and water
 
supplies, and 
shelter requirements. Bay participates in training offered through the District in CPR and first aid, as well as emergency 
training held at the county level.
 
 
Parents and members of the community are employed at Bay to monitor students durin
g lunch and at arrival/dismissal 
times. All visitors and employees are required to wear badges when they enter the campus. Bay works with the Alameda 
County Fire Department to ensure that that school facility meets all fire standards and structural safety 
standards. Bay 
also participates in the Alameda County Safe Routes to School program.
 
 
The School Safety Plan was most recently reviewed, updated, and discussed with school faculty in October 2019.

-
2020 school years, teachers participated in 2.5 to 6 days of professional 
development.  In addition to ongoing site
-
based professional development and coaching, all 
teachers have the opportunity 
to improve their skills by taking college courses, workshops provided by the District, and in
-
services or other workshops 
offered by the County Office of Education and other organizations. Teachers have opportunities to attend
 
professional 
conferences supported by site or District funding.
 
 
Since the integration of technology is important to student success, teachers also have access to technology workshops 
through the District's Office of Technology Integration; these workshop
s are offered throughout the school year and also 
during the summer. The District regularly offers courses that provide multiple hours of professional development on how 
to integrate technology to support standards and learning as well as professional coll
aboration.
 
 
Teachers also receive peer coaching and in
-
classroom support in order to provide other meaningful opportunities for 
coaching and professional development.
 
 
Professional Development for New Teachers:
 
Through participation in the Contra Costa Cou
nty Office of Education Teacher Induction Program, the District secures 
support providers to work with our new teachers. Through this Teacher Induction Program, new teachers are also afforded 
the opportunity to take university
-
level courses at a reduced tu
ition cost. This program offers training to new teachers for 
two years, as they sharpen their skills as educators. The induction portion of this program leads them to acquire their clear
 
credential through the Commission on Teacher Credentialing.
