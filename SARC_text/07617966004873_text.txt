Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school us
es 
the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California
 
OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest prio
rity. The school personnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

Murphy Elementary has multiple 
opportunities for parental involvement. Our community engagement committee 
includes teachers, parents, and
 
 
members of our community working together to support the success of multiple programs that we provide at Murphy. A 
few of the programs/committees th
at are supported through parental support are:
 

 
Tiger Paw Store

Volunteers provide library service for one additional day per week.
 

 
Parent nights (coding, Star Gazing, Math Night, ELA Night and more to come)
 

 
Coffee Chats once pe
r month
 

 
Zumba Classes for parents weekly
 

 
Study trips
 

 
classroom parent
 

 
A parent room to collaborate and support students
 
In addition, We have a PTO committee that supports our student study trips through various fundraisers such as cookie 
dough sales, plush
 
animal sales, candy cane lane, ice cream sales, and daily chocolate sales. Our PTO supports events 
throughout the school year such as red ribbon week, spirit week, scholastic book fair, and participation in the spelling bee.
 
With the support of the PTO Mu
rphy is able to provide all classrooms with support and quality experiences to enrich the 
education of all of our Murphy Tigers.
 
 
Murphy also has other committees that support parental voice and involvement such as our African American Advisory 
Committee. 
We are working together to ensure that our students meet the rigorous exceptions of the common core state 
standards and are working as a team to bring in programming to support that goal. We also have a School Site Council 
made up of teachers, staff and co
mmunity members. Our council ensures that we develop a strong instructional plan and 
use our financial resources to support the school plan.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of the School Site Safety Plan is to provide a unified template for school sites to respond 
and recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the disruption of normal school operations.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan guides a coordinated school staff response to an emergency, disaster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response 
activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over time and those that may occur without warning.
 
 
The objectives of the School Site Safety Plan are as follows
:
 
1.
 
Protect the safety and welfare of students, school staff, and visitors.
 
2.
 
Provide for a safe and coordinated response to emergencies.
 
3.
 

 
4.
 
Enable the District to restore normal conditions with
 
minimal confusion in the shortest time possible.
 
5.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between sites and the District Emergency Operations Center (DEOC).
 
6.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between the District EOC and the Cities of Richmond, 
El Cerrito, San 
Pablo, Pinole, Hercules, and Contra Costa County Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
 
7.
 
Provide for the orderly conversion of pre
-
designated District sites to mass care sites, when necessary.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is updated ann
ually.  Our school safety plan was last annually reviewed, updated, 
and discussed with school faculty and a student representative in January 2020.  A copy of the Comprehensive School 

bruary 2020.

Quality instruction and a warm welcoming environment is a goal for Murphy Elementary School. To ensure this, the district 
and the school site engage teachers, administrators and other personnel in ongoing professional development focused on 
improving teach
ing and learning and the climate of our school campus. Our Instructional leadership team and climate 
committee provide monthly professional development to our staff to ensure continued growth and to maintain a cohesive 
program that meets the needs of all s
tudents. Teachers also participate in three
-
four hour collaborations monthly with 
their grade
-
level partners planning instruction and designing learning experiences for students. At Murphy, there are also 
opportunities for individual goal setting and suppo
rt through observations and debriefs or classroom visits on and off
-
site. 
Our primary goal of the professional development program is ensuring that all students are served by reflective, 
collaborative teachers and staff that are continuously growing and im
proving their practice.
