School Description
 
Mission:
 
As a professional learning community, we, at Rancho Mirage Elementary School, will work 
collectively to provide a safe school environment that embraces diversity, and ensure that all 
students meet/exceed the California State Standards, and exhibit their pe
rsonal best as we prepare 
them to be college and career ready, as well as productive citizens of society.
 
 
School Description:
 


rovide rigorous instruction aligned with the California State 
Standards.  We provide a safe, student
-
centered learning environment. Students are supported 
academically, and socio
-
emotionally.  Academically, the California Department of Education, in 
conjun
ction with the Palm Springs Unified School District provides instructional frameworks for 
each grade level and subject area.  Rancho Mirage Elementary School is dedicated to providing a 
rich California Common Core State Standards
-
based curriculum with high
 
expectations that ensures 

Benchmark assessments and progress monitoring are on an on
-
going basis for all students. In
-
school Tier 2 intervention, as well as 
before and after school intervention programs are 
implemented for students not yet meeting standards.  Students are recognized for academic and 
behavioral achievement throughout the school year during monthly Flag Assemblies, Accelerated 
Reader Awards Asse
mblies, monthly Sight Word Award Assemblies (K
-
1), Trimester Awards 
Assemblies (Gr. 1
-
5).  Areas of recognition include:  ELA, Math, Academic Improvement, and 

po
sitive choices.  These tickets are entered into a prize drawing.  An assembly is also held for those 
students making a year's growth on the ELA and Math state test.
 
 
Socio
-
emotionally, students have various opportunities to be recognized for positive choic
es, and 
interact through group programs.  We are in partnership with McCallum Theatre.  Students are 
exposed to artistic educational
-
aligned workshops in school, and performances at the theatre 
throughout the school year.  Rancho Mirage Elementary students
 
also have the opportunity to 
participate in music education, Red Hot Ballroom (ballroom dancing), Tools for Tomorrow (literacy
-
based drama), other district events (Spelling Bee; Science Fair), and school
-
wide performances (ex/ 
Winter Program; Talent Show)
 
and peer interactions through classroom projects, growth mindset, 
and STEAM
-

-
emotional growth.  We have a very 
dedicated Parent Teacher Group (PTG), which meets monthly and has diligently provided support
 
for all students and staff.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned
 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Nestled in the environmentally protected desert cove, Rancho Mirage School provides a safe, clean and effective environment f
or learning. The 39
-
year
-
old school was remodeled as a result of state funds provided by a 1995 bo
nd issue. In the summer of 2001, five portable classrooms were replaced and 
a two
-
story six
-
classroom building was built. In the summer of 2004, three more portable classrooms were removed, replaced with another two
-
story 
building. Thirty classrooms are no
w available. The primary, kindergarten, and intermediate playground were renovated in the summer of 2013. Shade 
structures, shade trees, benches and additional drinking fountains have been provided by parents and the Parent Teacher Group
. Parking lots for 
staff, 
parents and community are provided on either side of the school. A zone for parents to drop off and pick up students provides
 
additional safety for all 
students not riding the bus or walking. Supervision of students is provided starting at 8:00 A.M.
 
The ASES program provides after school tutorials, 
homework assistance, and after
-
school activities at no charge to approximately 100 students. All gates to the school are locked during the school day, 
with access available only through the office. All bui
ldings are connected to a security system that has kept vandalism and theft to a minimum. Two full
-
time custodians are assigned to the school, one during the school day and one in the evening. Handicap access is available sc
hool wide. Visitors comment 
freq
uently on the beauty and cleanliness of the school, and we are proud of the magnificent setting of our campus.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Invo
lvement (School Year 2019
-

Parents are always welcome at Rancho Mirage School, and play a vital role in the school family. All parents are encouraged to
 
attend Back
-
to
-
School 
Night as well as two parent
-
teacher conferences during the school year. In add
ition, the school encourages parents to become volunteers in the 
classroom, library, or on the playground. We value parents who wish to assist with field trips and class activities. The Ranc
ho Mirage Parent Engagement 
Policy is distributed to all parents a
t the beginning of each school year.   Volunteer applications are approved at the District level after parents complete 
a short form,  an online session, and background checks are completed. At Rancho Mirage Elementary School we provide accessib
ility and o
pportunities 
for parents with limited English proficiency, parents with disabilities, and parents of migratory students to participate in 
our school and the development 
of Rancho Mirage Elementary School's parent engagement policy by attending School Site 
Council meetings and participating fully in all activities and 
events. Translation is offered for all meetings and in all information sent home.
 
Our Parent Teacher Group (P.T.G.) meets monthly and assists in providing enriched experiences for all Rancho Mi
rage students. P.T.G. members have 
managed fundraisers, provided refreshments and materials for events, planned and held Family Nights including the annual Ram 
Fest (formerly known 
as the Monster Ball), purchased books and school equipment, and funded fiel
d trips. The School Site Council meets several times a year to assist with 
decision
-
making at the school, and includes representatives from the English Language Advisory Council. Parents are elected to this co
uncil, though all 
parents may attend meetings. 
The members of the School Site Council plan and assist in implementing the school plan. A Rancho Mirage Elementary 
School Compact has been developed and approved by staff and parents for use. The signed Compacts are on file in the classroom
s. Monthly newsl
etters 
highlight upcoming opportunities for parents to be involved in school activities and provide a monthly calendar of events. Th
e principal's message 
addresses topics of concern to parents including safety issues, achievement data, and techniques desig
ned to assist parents in helping their children at 
home.  These are posted on our website. STEAM Lab and Science fair activities help to foster skills for their child's grade l
evel standards, and are funded 
with a portion of the Title I funding used for pa
rent involvement. Announcements of parenting classes in the district are provided as they are available. 
Announcements of school and community activities which involve parents and students are also provided to parents. Rancho Mira
ge Elementary School 
celeb
rates the support provided to a student when parents, the school, and the community work together to benefit our children.

Each year we have designed professional learning based on student achievement data, research of best practices and 
discussions with teachers and 
principals. The specific approaches vary by content area. For ELA, in 2017
-
18, the focus was on aligning instruction to Smarter Balanced Assessments, 
depth of knowledge, and deeper understanding of the Reading Targets in Claim
 
1. In 2018
-
19 the focus was on the gradual release model, and 2019
-
20 
was an extension of the previous two years. The professional development in these areas was provided by the Schoolhouse Proje
ct. In 2018
-
19 the 
teachers began working with High Impact M

The training will take place over the course of three years.  During Year 1 (2018
-
19) the focus was on developing strategies to support number sense 
by 
implementing mental math routines and highlight the landscape of learning in mathematics. During Year 2 (2019
-
20) the focus is on strengthening mental 
math routines, identifying the math goal of a lesson, and planning for and implementing a three
-
part l
esson (Launch, Explore, Summarize). This 
professional development also supports teachers with the implementation of the district
-
adopted math program (Bridges in Mathematics and Number 
Corner).
 
The numbers in the chart above represent 4 days of ELA trainin
g in 2017
-
18. For both 2018
-
19 and 2019
-
20 there are 6 days per year of training for ELA. 
The remaining number of days in 2018
-
19 and 2019
-
20 are full days of professional learning for math.
