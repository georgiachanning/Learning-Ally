About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional in
formation about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Safety 
 
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Kordyak Elementary School. All visitors to the campus must sign in a

responsibility shared among parent/guardian volunteers, teachers, and administrators. To further safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, a 
comprehensive School Site Safety Plan has been deve
loped by the School Site Council. The Safety Plan was most recently updated in March 2018; any 
revisions and updates are reviewed immediately with the staff. Key elements of the Safety Plan focus on the following: 
 

 
School rules & procedures
 

 
Disaster proced
ures/routine & emergency drills
 

 
Current status of school crime
 

 
Notification to teachers

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
