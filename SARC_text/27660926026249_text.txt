About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Avai
lability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Monterey Peninsula Unified School District held a public hearing on August 2019, and determined that the school had sufficien
t and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials, p
ursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given 
their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to ta
ke home. Textbooks 
and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making the 
textbooks used in the 
school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by
 
all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School 
Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent ex
amination at the district 
office prior to adoption. The table displays inf
ormation collected in August 2018 about the quality, currency, and availability of the California Common 
Core standards

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
In 2010, the Monterey Peninsula Unified Schoo
l District overwhelmingly approved Measure P, a $110 million locally
-
controlled school bond measure to 
fund the first phase of critical repairs and improvement to our local schools. The district's newest school was built in 1965
, more than 50 years ago, an
d 
our Facilities Needs Assessment has identified over $680 million in critical repairs to all MPUSD schools. Recently, in 2018,
 
voters approved Measure I, a 
$213 million school facilities bond by 70%.
 
 
Many school bond projects are underway. Visit www.mpus
d.net and search for Measure I & P Dollars at Work for additional details.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the
 
Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an
 
assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical systems, heating and ventila
tion 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good
 
repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for
 
this assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about 
by the Williams legislation. You can look at the six

page Facilities Inspection 
Tool used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC.

[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligib

may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

ducation for final review and adoption. The approved plans are 
posted on each school's website, as well as the district website at www.mpusd.net.
 
 
Highlight's of this school's plan are detailed below.
 
 
Student safety is a top priority at Olson. Our staff m
onitors the school playground areas beginning 15 minutes before school opens and after school until 
the buses or parents have picked up all students.  Our staff uses a district
-
adopted social and emotional anti
-
bullying, anti
-
violence curriculum called 


-
based extended opportunity called 
After School Campus Academy before and after regular school instruction.
 
 
The safety plan, which is reviewed
 
and revised each year, calls for monthly evacuation drills, twice
-
yearly earthquake drills, and Shelter in Place and 
Lockdown drills. As part of Monterey Peninsula Unified School District, Olson staff and students are being trained to use the
 
ALICE (Alert
, Lockdown, 
Inform, Counter, and Evacuate) training in the event of an active shooter on campus. We will continue the implementation and 
modification of a school 
wide Positive Behavior Intervention Support (PBIS) program, where the focus is on teaching beh
avior expectations and acknowledging students who 
make strong choices. PBIS also supports students who need additional support for behavior.
 
 
An updated Safety Plan and Crisis Response Plan are reviewed and revised by staff and the Schoolsite Council each 
fall. The key elements include monthly 
emergency drills for earthquakes, intruders, and fire responses. Key personnel have designated roles to serve in the case of 
an emergency. A plan is in 
place for evacuation of the site, as well as the release of stude
nts. Our Safety plan also includes a plan for the effective use of the AED (Automated 
External Defibrillator) device, located in the front office.Protocols are in place for students who require medication on cam
pus and for those students 
who need medical a
ction plans. Staff are trained yearly in the use of epi
-
pens.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Every year Olson elementary analyzes multiple sources of data and reviews the latest research to determine the most important
, influential, and 
impactful 
ways in which the school can grow professionally in order increase student achievement. Based on this analysis, Olson has est
ablished a systematic and 
responsive approach in offering a suite of professional development support that will target li
teracy, mathematics, and social/emotional needs of all 
faculty and students. School goals for the 2020
-
2021 school year include a focus on increasing overall reading & writing performance, emphasizing on 
mathematical concepts & procedures, and lowering chr
onic absenteeism & increasing Average Daily Attendance (ADA).
 
 
Olson believes in a collaborative and shared responsibility model of professional development. The Olson Instructional Leader
ship Team (ILT) has 
developed into a critical element in designing a
nd delivering regular professional development to faculty.  These adult learning experiences are focused 
on balanced literacy, social/emotional learning, and mathematics with intentional effort on modeling instructional best exper
iences. Students are 
relea
sed early every Wednesday to allow for Professional Learning Communities (PLC) to employ the Data Wise process in order to in
crease student 
achievement related to school goals outlined in the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement.  In addition, Olson partner
s with world class professional 
development organizations in order to provide job embedded year long teacher learning experiences that include up to 20 days 
of on site professional 
learning from the Public Education Business Coalition (PEBC) for Mathematic
s and the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) for literacy.
 
 
Olson recognizes the year long demand and challenge of being a teacher. Thus, Olson strives to fully support teacher learning
 
in professional development 
in many different ways. 
Some of these include:
 
1.
 
Providing necessary instructional materials and resources to implement curriculum
 
2.
 
Release time for data analysis and job embedded learning
 
3.
 
Access to teacher driven 1:1 and small group instructional coaching employing a cogni
tive coaching model of support
 
4.
 
Individualized learning pathways via a cutting edge evaluation system that offers a cyclical year long cycle of feedback
