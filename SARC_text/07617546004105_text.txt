By

1
 
of
 
each
 
year,
 
every
 
school
 
in
 
California

required
 
by
 
state
 
law
 
to
 
publish
 
a
 
School
 
Accountability
 
Report
 
Card
 
(SARC).
 
The
 
SARC
 
contains
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
condition
 
and
 
performance
 
of
 
each
 
California
 
public
 
school.
 
Under
 
the

Formula
 
(LCFF)
 
all

(LEAs)
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
prepare
 
a
 
Local
 
Control
 
and
 
Accountability
 
Plan
 
(LCAP),
 
which
 
describes
 
how
 
they
 
intend
 
to
 
meet
 
annual
 
school-specific
 
goals
 
for
 
all
 
pupils,
 
with
 
specific
 
activities
 
to
 
address
 
state
 
and
 
local
 
priorities.
 
Additionally,
 
data
 
reported
 
in

Description
 
and
 
Mission
 
Statement
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
Dear
 
Hawk
 
Families,
 
 
 
 
As
 
we
 
enter
 
another
 
school
 
year,
 
we
 
are
 
happy
 
to
 
let
 
you
 
know
 
we
 
will
 
continue
 
to
 
utilize
 
the
 
PBIS
 
system
 
(Positive
 
Behavior
 
Interventions
 
and
 
Support)
 
at
 
Highlands
 
Elementary
 
School.
  
The
 
premise
 
of
 
the
 
program
 
is
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
safe,
 
effective
 
and
 
positive
 
learning
 
environment
 
for
 
every
 
child
 
by
 
explicitly
 
teaching
 
behavioral
 
expectations.
  
Research
 
has
 
proven
 
that
 
schools
 
are
 
successful
 
when
 
they
 
help
 
students
 
grow
 
academically,
 
socially,
 
and
 
emotionally.
  
By
 
setting
 
forth
 
clear
 
social
 
and
 
behavioral
 
expectations
 
and
 
holding
 
students
 
accountable
 
for
 
following
 
the
 
school
 
wide
 
expectations,
 
we
 
are
 
confident
 
we
 
will
 
see
 
an
 
increase
 
in
 
student
 
learning
 
and
 
a
 
decrease
 
in
 
classroom
 
disruptions.
 
 
 
 
Unfortunately,
 
there
 
will
 
be
 
times
 
some
 
students
 
misbehave
 
even
 
though
 
we
 
have
 
explicitly
 
taught
 
them
 
our
 
expectations,
 
offered
 
reminders
 
of
 
the
 
expected
 
behaviors,
 
and
 
used
 
the
 
positive
 
reinforcement
 
system.
  
When
 
this
 
occurs,
 
the
 
staff
 
will
 
use
 
the
 
Office
 
Discipline
 
Referral
 
Form
 
or
 
the
 
administration
 
will
 
use
 
the
 
Check
 
and
 
Connect
 
Referral
 
Form.
  
These
 
forms
 
look
 
at
 
minor
 
and
 
major
 
infractions.
  
The
 
document
 
will
 
be
 
recorded
 
in
 
writing
 
so
 
that
 
you
 
will
 
have
 
a
 
copy
 
and
 
can
 
speak
 
to
 
your
 
child
 
about
 
the
 
behaviors.
  
Teachers
 
will
 
make
 
telephone
 
contact
 
with
 
parents
 
as
 
soon
 
as
 
the
 
behaviors
 
begins
 
so
 
that
 
a
 
plan
 
can
 
be
 
formulated
 
that
 
brings
 
parents
 
and
 
teachers
 
together
 
to
 
correct
 
the
 
behaviors
 
of
 
the
 
student.
 
Our
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
keep
 
the
 
lines
 
of
 
communication
 
open
 
between
 
school
 
and
 
home.
 
 
 
 
Directly
 
following
 
the
 
PBIS
 
handbook,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
section
 
titled
 
Student
 
Handbook.
 
Please
 
take
 
a
 
look
 
through
 
the
 
document
 
and
 
ask
 
any
 
questions
 
that
 
come
 
up.
 
I
 
am
 
looking
 
forward
 
to
 
an
 
amazing
 
year
 
at
 
Highlands,
 
building
 
upon
 
the
 
momentum
 
we
 
started
 
last
 
year.
 
 
 
 
Sincerely,
 
 
Ryan
 
Sheehy

To

developed

is
 
a

to
 
academic
 
success.
 
Parents
 
are
 
involved
 
in
 
many

including
 
volunteering
 
in
 
the
 
classrooms,
 
as

School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
As
 
a
 
matter
 
of
 
security,
 
Highlands
 
requires
 
all
 
visitors
 
on
 
the
 
school
 
grounds
 
to
 
sign
 
in
 
and
 
out
 
in
 
the
 
office.
 
 
We
 
have
 
collected
 
materials
 
for
 
emergency
 
earthquake
 
kits
 
for
 
all
 
classrooms.
 
These
 
kits
 
provide
 
medical
 
supplies
 
and
 
release
 
information.
 
Each
 
year
 
we
 
take
 
an
 
inventory
 
of
 
needed
 
supplies
 
to
 
ensure
 
all
 
classes
 
have
 
supplies.
 
 
The
 
Safety
 
Committee
 
has
 
prepared
 
detailed
 
procedures
 
for
 
emergencies
 
that
 
coincide
 
with
 
SEMS
 
specifications.
 
The
 
safety
 
committee
 
three
 
to
 
four
 
times
 
yearly.
 
Procedures
 
and
 
the
 
school
 
safety
 
plan
 
are
 
reviewed
 
and
 
revised
 
yearly.
 
Walkie-talkies
 
have
 
been
 
purchased
 
to
 
enhance
 
daily
 
safety
 
(used
 
by
 
yard
 
supervisors,
 
noon
 
supervisors,
 
office
 
staff,
 
custodians,
 
and
 
administration).
 
Fire
 
drills
 
and
 
other
 
emergency
 
drills,
 
including
 
lockdown
 
drills,
 
are
 
held
 
regularly.
 
Highlands
 
participated
 
in
 
the
 
Great
 
California
 
Shake-Out
 
and
 
held
 
a
 
debriefing
 
meeting
 
to
 
determine
 
next
 
steps.
 
 
An
 
Emergency
 
Response
 
plan
 
has
 
been
 
implemented
 
and
 
is
 
reviewed
 
with
 
all
 
staff
 
members
 
several
 
times
 
through
 
the
 
school
 
year.
 
Our
 
staff
 
reviewed
 
our
 
safety
 
plan
 
during
 
our
 
September
 
staff
 
meeting
 
and
 
will
 
review
 
it
 
again
 
during
 
our
 
April
 
staff
 
meeting.
 
 
The
 
Highlands
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
was
 
approved
 
by
 
the
 
School
 
Site
 
Council
 
at
 
a
 
public
 
hearing
 
on
 
1/13/20.
