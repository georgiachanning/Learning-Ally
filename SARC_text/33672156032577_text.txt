Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
With an enrollment of 668 students, Emerson Elementary School is gem that sits in the heart of the city of Riverside.   At 
Emerson, we strive to provide students with a well
-
rounded learning experience that supports both their academic and 
socia
l
-
emotional development. Unique to Riverside, Emerson is home to the city's oldest community garden having been 
around since approximately 1980. The community garden projects positive use of land; enhances the school's role in the 
community; provides healt
hful and fun activities; and offers positive after
-
school activities for youth and adults. Emerson 
is an AVID elementary school that embodies the principle that students should be held accountable to the highest 
standards and with academic and social suppo
rt they can and WILL rise to the challenge.
 
 
The mission of Emerson Elementary School is to ensure that every child meets or exceeds proficiency on State Standards.  
We recognize that each child is an individual; that all children are creative; and that al
l children need to succeed. It is our 
mission to create a learning environment that emphasizes the social, emotional, physical, and intellectual development 
of each child. Our goals are to provide high quality literacy development during core instruction a
nd to ensure highly 
effective language development strategies are used during core instruction (integrated) and during designated English 
Language Development (ELD). We monitor our progress every 6 to 8 weeks and make adjustments based on student need 
as d
etermined by data. We monitor our success toward our goals through student performance on literacy/numeracy 
assessments, state wide English proficiency assessments, and through informal data collection.

Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Asses
sments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standar
ds, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the Univer
sity of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula

scores.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. T
he achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

-

The Site Safety Committee is responsible for the development and updating of the school's Comprehensive Safety Plan. A 
Site Comprehensive Safety Plan Checklist is provided by the Pupil Services Department to give guidance on what should 
be included in the 
School's Safety Plan. The Safety Plan is discussed with staff, evaluated, amended/reviewed/updated by 
January 31 of each year. The school's safety committee makes monthly safety inspections. A school Disaster Preparedness 
Plan that deals with a wide variet
y of emergency situations is incorporated into the School Safety Plan.  Earthquakes, fire, 
lockdown, and active shooter/intruder drills are conducted as required. The key elements of the Comprehensive School 
Safety Plan include an assessment of current sta
tus of school crime; provisions of any schoolwide dress code including the 
definition of "gang related apparel"; safe movement of pupils, parents and school employees to and from school; 
strategies in maintaining a safe and orderly school environment; visi
tors on campus; child abuse reporting procedures; 
disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to suspensions, expulsion or mandatory expulsion and other 
school designated serious acts which would lead to suspension or expulsion, notificati
on to teachers, anti
-
bullying policy, 
discrimination/harassment, and school discipline rules and procedures pursuant to EC 35291 and EC 35291.5. The school 
also has an assigned School Resource Officer (SRO).
