professional staff and community members are committed to making our school the center of our 
community, where parents, students, and neighbors can come to learn, soci
alize, participate in

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

ergartners, we train 
students in anger management and conflict resolu

haracter and a positive 
school cu
lture.  We recognize students in the classrooms daily, weekly and monthly for academics and effort.  We celebrate student suc
cess.  We also 
conduct monthly fire, earthquake, disaster, and lockdown drills.

you'll see the amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development.
 
 
T
eachers participate in professional development opportunities provided by the school district. Site based professional develo
pment takes place through 
school wide professional Learning Communities bimonthly on the first and third Wednesdays of every month.
 
For 2019
-
2020 we are also using these 
Wednesdays for professional development opportunities (not reflected in the numbers above). Grade levels have three planning 
days to review 
curriculum, instruction and assessment.
