By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Dear Haynes Families and Friends,
 
 
At Richard E. Haynes Elementary School, we remain committed to the development and implementation of a shared vision 
for academic achievement, social and em
otional well
-
being for all students, school site initiatives and district initiatives to 
improve learning and teaching for all. Haynes students are challenged to do their best work every day under the guidance 
and support of our highly qualified teaching s
taff, parent volunteers and support staff. Personal leadership and scholarly 
behaviors are taught and emphasized so that students learn how to be assertive learners, make quality personal decisions, 
set personal goals and hold high expectations for achievi
ng both academically and socially.
 
 
We foster and maintain an environment where students are engaged in a meaningful way and their families have multiple 

 
to make our school a 
great place where students learn to be SAFE, RESPECTFUL, and RESPONSIBLE.
 
 
 
 
Mission Statement: The mission of Richard E. Haynes, a progressive and collaborative educational community, is to 
prepare each student to excel as a successf
ul participant in an ever changing society through a commitment to standards 
of excellence.
 
 
Richard E. Haynes Elementary School supports a student enrollment of approximately 806 students in transitional 
kindergarten through sixth grade. In 
addition, Haynes School has two pre
-
school classes, one primary SDC class, and one 
County SED class. The school is located in the city of Ontario in the Ontario
-
Montclair School District and serves a diverse 
student population of which 84.25% of students p
articipate in the free or reduced lunch program and approximately 52.7% 
speak a primary language other than English. Haynes School has an active School Site Council  and School English Learner 
Parent Advisory Council. Haynes School supports student attenda
nce through incentive programs as w ell as Saturday 
Attendance Academies that allow students to recoup absences. Haynes School supports student learning by providing 
highly qualified teachers and rigorous general education and special education curriculum,
 
as w ell as interventions 
between the bells, at lunchtime (when possible), before and after school, and on Saturdays. Haynes staff members provide 
a variety of opportunities for parent involvement such as Coffee and Conversations, instructional workshops,
 
Student 
Success Team meetings, Fall Festival, GATE Parent Meetings, Special Education Meetings, and student recognition 
activities. In addition, Haynes School is fortunate to have a high participation rate of parent volunteers, all of whom have 
participat
ed in our OMSD volunteer training program prior to working in classrooms, supporting field trips or supervising 
children under the direction of certificated staff members.

School
-
wide results of various district assessments in Math and Language Arts are r
eview ed by the Site Instructional 
Leadership Team and grade level teams at data and planning meetings. These teams review school
-
wide trend data in 
order to establish goals, identify focus standards, and develop instructional strategies to support student
 
needs for the 
school year. The Site Instructional Leadership Team meets on an ongoing basis with the focus on identifying deliberate 
decisions and action steps that will be communicated to their grade level teams at data and planning meetings. These 
delib
erate decisions and action steps are used to facilitate discussion and instructional focus in a professional learning 
community format (PLC) after each benchmark assessment, and during planning meetings that take place in between 
benchmark assessments. Dis
trict pacing calendars in Language Arts and Math, as well as the Common Core State Standards 
and district assessment data, are used during these meetings to focus the instructional program. Data from Illuminate is 
made available to all staff members and is
 
aggregated based on data need (EL students, significant subgroups, etc). The 
data accessed can also be broken down by grade level, teacher, class, program, and the individual student. Grade levels 
identify goals for the year, each testing period, and indi
vidual students. Smart goals are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, 
Related, and Time
-
bound targets for student performance (grade level and school
-
wide). Progress toward those goals is 
monitored regularly through common formative assessments and/or classro
om measures (RI/Phonics Screeners/ ESGI/ 
Reading Fluency). Interventions (Between the Bells & After School) are implemented to support student acquisition of 
grade level standards. Reading comprehension and English Language Development are areas of specifi
c focus. Use of 
graphic organizers and Advanced Thinking Maps serve to support and develop reading comprehension, as well as English 
Language Development and writing. Haynes School also has adopted a school
-
wide writing program to support written 
language 
for all students and build critical writing skills across the grades (Write From The Beginning).

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

calculated by taking the total 
number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of stu
dents who met the standard (i.e., 
achieved Level 3
-
Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total numbe
r of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student
 
privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. T
he achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parental 
Involvement is valued at Haynes. Haynes School hosts Coffee and Conversation forums where parents are invited 
to meet with staff informally to discuss issues important to them and their children. We also have a School Site Council 
(SSC) which meets four to
 
six times a year to participate in the planning and approval of the School Plan. SSC also provides 
input into budgetary decisions made at the school. This year we will continue to provide our School Site Council with 
training on how to work most effective
ly within their individual elected roles, as well as building the capacity of the whole 
SSC team. There is now a School Planning Team that is assisting in writing the School Plan by providing input, sharing ideas,
 
and writing sections of the School Plan. P
ricilla Haro  (parent) is Haynes' SSC facilitator. Mr. Jamemy Barnett (Principal) 
serves as School Site Council Coordinator and can be reached at Haynes School (909) 984

Regular school
-
to
-
home communication is provided in both English and Spanish. I
nformation about current events and 
school activities can be found on the Haynes Elementary School website, flyers and social media accounts (such as Twitter 
and Class DoJo). At Haynes, we ensure that important news and announcements are made to parents ut
ilizing the school's 
automated telephone system, texts messages via Blackboard Connect and social media as previously mentioned. Parents 
who want more information, or wish to participate, may contact Mr. Barnett, Mrs. Allen or Mrs. Silva at (909) 984
-

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The 
Haynes School safety plan was updated in August 2019. The staff reviewed the school plan for student safety and 
discipline in August 2019. Continued adjustments to the plan are addressed on
-
going throughout the school year with the 
safety team and School S
ite Council. Haynes School consistently follows a progressive discipline policy aligned with PBIS 
that outlines expectations for working, learning, and behaving at Haynes School. All students and families are provided 
with school rules for dress and conduc
t, as well as expectations for student behavior. All students and parents are provided 
with a written copy of the Student/Parent handbook (English and/or Spanish) and individual calendar agendas (grade 3
-
6) that support regular daily communication between 
home and school. Haynes implements regular Fire, Duck/Cover, and 
Lockdown Drills which are conducted monthly within the entire school. Classroom emergency backpacks have been 
cleaned, restocked with safety supplies, and redistributed to every classroom. Sa
fety Talks with topics provided by OMSD 
Risk Management Department occur monthly at staff meetings and in the school newsletter. The school addresses site
-
specific concerns such as student injuries, blood borne disease guidelines, MRSA informational presen
tations, and tips to 
stay healthy. The plan was reviewed with the staff and updated again in January 2020 and will be refined throughout the 
year as needed.

Montclair School District offers research
-
based, on
-
going professional development for certificated, classified, 
and management employees aligned with the district's long
-
term goals. Professional development is designed to help 
employees enhance th
eir knowledge, and develop needed skills to provide quality services in order to maximize student 
learning and achievement. Professional development courses and programs are developed and coordinated through the 
district's Robert Hardy Professional Develop
ment Center as well as at each school site. The focus of all professional 
development is based on the instructional and management priorities outlined in the goals and objectives of our strategic 
and school improvement plans. Professional development at th
e site and district level addresses the core curriculum, 
instructional strategies, standards
-
based instruction, effective use of technology, and classroom management. In addition, 
district level professional development includes workshop sessions and class
room support for beginning teachers (BTSA), 
courses for teachers working toward their teaching credentials, technology training and classroom support, leadership 
development for administrators, compliance related workshops, and a variety of job
-
specific an
d mandated trainings for 
classified employees. OMSD has several sustained initiatives, including Thinking Maps, school
-
wide writing programs, Kate 
Kinsella (Reading, Speaking, and Writing...ELD), Response to Intervention (RtI), Writing and the California C
ommon Core 
Standards. Programs are driven by data and are specifically designed instruction based on student need. Coaches are 
trained by the district to provide ongoing support at each site to ensure and support the correct implementation in each 
classroo
m. Based on student assessment data, Haynes School staff participated in staff development based on trends of 
needs indicated in SBAC and school benchmark data. English Language Development, High Yield Instructional Strategies, 
Structured Academic Talk, Wr
ite From The Beginning... and Beyond, SFA tutor program, and Cognitive Planning with 
district and site funded instructional coaches was provided to classroom teachers. As we have now implemented the 
Common Core State Standards (CCSS), district trainings ar
e provided on use of the Eureka Math Modules. Structured 
teacher planning time is provided to support teachers in conducting data analysis and monitoring student achievement 
trends, so as to plan effective responses to student achievement needs and necessa
ry intervention. The staff is also being 
trained on gradual release and learning targets.  All classroom teachers (including RSP/SDC and paraprofessionals) 
participated in the trainings, as well as non
-
classroom support staff, teachers, and administration.
 
Teachers were 
supported by the teacher leaders and administrators in implementing new instructional strategies. Trainings were 
provided by Instructional Coaches, Teacher Leaders, Administration, the Tech Support Team and OMSD content TOAs. 
Haynes' Instruc
tional Leadership team worked collaboratively to establish school
-
wide performance goals and SMART 
goals.
