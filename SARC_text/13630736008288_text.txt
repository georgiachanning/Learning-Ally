By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 2019
 
 
The school district held a 
public hearing on September 24, 2019 and on December 10, 2019, and determined that each 
school within the district had sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment 
pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the S
tate of California. All students, including English Learners, are given their 
own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials 
are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California 
Department of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use 
by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to t
he school Board by a selection committee 
composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district 
office prior to adoption.
 
 
The table displays information collected in September 2019 about the
 
quality, currency, and availability of the standards

Cleaning Process & Schedule
 
The District governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A team of three custodians 
ensures classrooms, restrooms, and campus ground
s are kept clean and safe every day. Daily walk throughs of the campus 
ensures that issues of concern are addressed immediately.
 
 
A summary of these standards is available at the school office or at the district office. The site 
administration team works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
The table shows the results of the most recent school facilities inspection. While reviewing this report, please note that 
even minor
 
discrepancies are reported in the inspection process. The items noted in the table have been corrected or are 
in the process of remediation.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintena
nce personnel are 
proactive and conduct inspections at school sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure that the highest priori
ty is 
given to emergency repairs and to those work orders that may potentially pose a safety concern to the students.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides matching funds on 
a dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building 
components. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor
 
systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP]
 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight
 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant co
gnitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or program
s 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
J.W. Oakley School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The school is always in 
compliance with all laws, rules, and 
regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. Parents 
and visitors are welcome; however, the school is a closed campus and all visitors must check in at the front office and 

rounds. Visitors are required to return to the school office upon 
departure.  School grounds are monitored before, during, and after school by assigned staff including administrators, 
campus security staff,  teachers, and noon duty supervisors to ensure a 
safe and orderly environment.
 
 


response model and
 
clearly outlines roles, responsibilities, and procedures to ensure timely and effective emergency 
response.  To further ensure the safety of our students, Brawley Elementary School District established a very detailed 
disaster plan for each of its schools
 
in the event of a disaster. The plan clearly explains specific duties and responsibilities 
for all levels of staff and site personnel to ensure student and staff safety during a disaster. The Comprehensive Safety 
Plan was developed by the district in cons
ultation with local law enforcement in order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 
1997. It is  designed to assist in preparing for emergencies, managing emergency response efforts, and maintaining a safe 
school environment. The plan requires identification of
 
security needs, development of prevention and intervention 
techniques, evaluation of physical facilities, and communication with staff and students. The plan provides students and 
staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Componen
ts of the Comprehensive Safety Plan include 
child abuse reporting procedures, teacher responsibilities and actions during lockdowns and other emergency situations, 
disaster response procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress from school, the sexual
 
harassment policy, the dress 
code, and procedures related to the compliance of existing laws as they affect school safety.
 
 
In order to prepare for possible emergency situations, fire drills are conducted monthly throughout the school year, 
earthquake dri
lls conducted twice a year, and district
-
wide disaster drills are conducted annually . Safety procedures, 
including elements of the Safe School Plan, are reviewed with school and district staff at the start of each school year.  An
 
updated copy of the plan
 
is available to the public at the district office. The plan was last updated and reviewed with 
school staff in the spring of 2019. New information is immediately updated in the School Safety Plan and distributed to all 
staff.

titled "Championing Student Learning".  This plan included 
intensive work with WestEd to provide English Learners with language instruction coupled with CCSS.  In addition, we have 
partnered with COEs to provide ELA Unit Development planning for our grade 
levels, as well as providing math support 
for the BESD Math Committee.  We will continue to provide time for collaboration to support our endeavor to become a 
professional learning community.  Our PD Plan for 18

t
hird year of PBIS training, with the goal of supporting students not only academically, but also behaviorally.    Our focus 
for 19

20 is to create a sustainable model that includes ongoing training in the following areas:  BeGLAD certification, PBIS, 
grade
 
level math collaboration focused on content and mathematical practices, and new teacher instructional support.  
This year, we have also begun our journey with Professional Learning Communities.  Finally, this is our first year to 
introduce Co

Teaching in 
two of our schools, with a goal of including all schools in the future. We continue to utilize the 
expertise of our Academic Coaches to provide differentiated teacher support at the site level.  While our goal is to keep 
teachers in the classroom, we offer
 
training scheduled during the school day, as well as after school.  Our site Educational 
Technology Mentors continue to offer hands
