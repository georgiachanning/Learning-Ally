activities and we work to provide a rich learning environment in every classr
oom, every day.
 
 
Family engagement is a critical piece to student achievement and families are always welcome at

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The selection of focus areas for on
-
going professional development is based on a 
careful analysis of achievement data. The district calendar earmarks 
full days and early release time for providing site
-
based professional development for all teachers. Teachers also have opportunities to attend conferences 
and district
-
wide professional 
development throughout the year. During the 2018
-
19 and 2019
-
20 school years all teachers at Rancho de la Nación School 
will receive approximately 30 hours of professional development in mathematics through the University of California Irvine su
bject matte
r project. This 
professional development will empower our teachers to deliver a cohesive, common core curriculum based on the CCSS. The proje
ct includes hands
-
on, 
research
-
based professional development, standards
-
based curriculum guides and unit plans ali
gned to the Common Core to assist our teachers in the 
implementation of our GoMath adoption. The Irvine Math Project team is comprised of classroom practitioners, math content exp
erts, and math 
education researchers. A focus on professional development aro
und the area of mathematics and ELA was selected in response to the needs highlighted 
in our CAASPP data. In the area of language arts, all of our teachers will receive in
-
depth professional development in the California ELA/ELD framework. 
The ELA/ELD fram
ework professional development has been selected as an area of focus due to our high numbers of English language learners and
 
the 
need for teachers to be excellent discerners of curriculum and materials needed to deliver robust and rigorous lessons. Both 
t
hese areas of focus have 
been delivered through teacher release days, bi
-
weekly data team meetings, collaboration days and weekly staff meetings, off the clock offerings and 
during individual teacher planning days. We have four Teachers on Special Assignme
nt (TOSA) that provide workshops in the area of Language Arts and 
English Language Development. This provides opportunity for the Language Arts and ELD workshops. With our new English Languag
e Arts adoption, all 
teachers will receive staff development in t
he implementation of our newly adopted BENCHMARK materials. To support daily, robust and rigorous 
reading, our district office has adopted the American Reading Company 100 book libraries. All teachers will receive staff dev
elopment on the 
implementation an
d best practices used for these reading baskets for students. Our counselors have received training on the Sanford Harmony so
cial
-
emotional curriculum which they will deliver in each classroom. Counselors will deliver this curriculum in all classrooms whi
l
e teachers support the 
implementation and lesson delivery. In addition, all teachers have received professional development on how to run restorativ
e circles in their classrooms 
in order to deliver Tier I positive behavior interventions and supports to all
 
students. The focus for teacher training includes effective instructional 
strategies for implementation of Common Core Standards, best practices for Data Teams collaboration, ELA Benchmark curriculum
, curriculum training 
in writing, language arts and math
ematics, as well as specific training to support the needs of English Learners. Teachers of students with special needs 
and teachers of newcomer students also receive specialized training to assist them in meeting the unique needs of their stude
nts. This p
rofessional 
development is provided in various formats, including whole staff group, grade
-
level teams, and through individual mentoring by the school 
administrator. The District also assists in the coordination of BTSA Induction Support for year one and t
wo teachers. Teachers who are experiencing 
difficulty or need improvement have access to the PAR (Peer Assistance Review) Program.
