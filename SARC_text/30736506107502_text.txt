By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We at Springbrook School strive to create an inclusive culture that promotes high levels of learning for all stu
dents; a place 
full of heart where students, staff, and families feel welcome and a sense of belonging.  For this current 2019
-
2020 school 
year, we are at a temporary site at El Camino while our Springbrook location receives extensive Measure E and 
moderni
zation work.  What we have found and continually share with our stakeholders is that Springbrook is not a 
building, it is our community of people.  We know that Springbrook is a WHO, not a WHERE. As our community fills a new 
building, the HEART of Springbr
ook will stay intact. We look forward to this next chapter of adventure.
 
 
We seek to make all families feel included and cared for, and are intentional about removing the barriers that persist for 
some students and parents, whether they be cultural, econom
ic, or academic.  Springbrook staff have actively cultivated 
a culture of intellectual risk
-
taking and a growth mindset over the past five years through modeling, encouraging errors 
as part of the learning process, and revisiting and revising our grading p
ractices.
 
 
The action steps and goals of our school and staff are in direct response to the needs of our students.  Our PLC (Professiona
l 
Learning Communities) work, our ongoing efforts to intervene both academically and socially/emotionally, and our 
inten
tional building of a positive climate are our utmost priorities. Our outstanding program is a direct result of the efforts 
of the dedicated and talented staff, the incredible support from our community, and the hard work of our students.  We 
look forward t
o a successful 2019
-
2020 school year as we continue these efforts.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent 
Year)
 
 
Springbrook School was constructed in 1989 as is well maintained and up
-
to
-
date. The building contains 18 classrooms in 
the main building, with 6 portables adjacent to the building which are
 
a part of the original construction. An additional 4 
portables have been added, with two dedicated to on
-
site childcare. The building sits on a large parcel of land with ample 
playground space and is adjacent to a city
-
owned park and neighborhood pool. Du
ring the Fall of 2014, a new shade 
structure was built.
 
 
As part of the Measure E Bond initiative, Springbrook is being fully modernized in 2019
-
2020.   The current staff and 
student body our currently housed at the former El Camino school site for the 201
9
-
2020 school year while the 
modernization efforts are completed onsite at Springbrook.
 
 
The current El Camino site had rather comprehensive renovations done three years ago before Meadow Park occupied it 
last year.  It included new carpet, video cameras, 
new paint, electrical and carpentry work.  There are no current needs 
with regards to facilities.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides
 
the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for
 
students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the admin
istration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have success
fully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

As a part of our commitment to safety, staff and students 
participate in scheduled fire, earthquake and lockdown 
preparedness drills. Springbrook School has developed a comprehensive Safe School Plan. Our plan is evaluated yearly 
and amended as needed by the School Site Council. This year it was reviewed on Octob
er 17, 2019.  We replenish supplies 
yearly, and currently we have supplies on hand in the event of an emergency. Key elements of the plan include: 1. 
Assessing the current status of school crime committed on the school campus and at school

In October of 2019, our school site participated in an earthquake simulation drill as part of California's Great Shakeout.  
During this dirll, we implemented many of our emergency response team
s from our Incident Command System. In 
February of 2020, our staff will also participate in a full
-
scale emergency simulation that will involve collaboration and 
participation of all teams within our Incident Command System. Also included in our plan is an
 
outline of our monthly 
emergency drills that range in situation: fire drill, earthquake drill, and/or lockdown drill. During all drills staff and st
udents 
practice safety procedures to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of our safety plan.
 
 
The staff
 
implemented an updated Positive Behavior Intervention Systems (PBIS) for the 2019/2020 school year.  Staff 
identified the values and norms that we live by as a school community followed by a vision statement created with a 
school
-
wide motto (Be Respectful
, Be Responsible, Be Ready). The PBIS Leadership Team led the staff through the 
development of a matrix identifying the behavioral expectations in multiple locations inside and outside the school 
grounds.  Student expectations are supported according to po
sitive values. The teachers and staff have a common lesson 
plan for addressing PBIS so that the language and lessons are consistent across settings and experiences.  The Seal Motto 
is as follows:
 
 
Seals Are:
 
 

 
Respectful
 

 
Responsible
 

 
Ready
 
 
Springbrook is a 
PBIS school which employs a behavioral Pyramid of Interventions.  Three tiers support students 
behaviorally and create safety nets for all students. First Tier programs include PBIS, Toolbox Lessons from our guidance 
assistant, and common language in model
ing and labeling desired behaviors. Second Tier interventions include small 
group lessons with our guidance assistant, short
-
term counseling by our elementary resource counselor, social stories, 
and behavior contracts. Third Tier behavior supports are one
-
to
-
one guidance with the guidance assistant counselor or 
elementary resource counselor, behavior plans and goals, social cognitive work, parent involvement, suspension and 
expulsion.
 
 
The comprehensive school safety plan was revised for this current school
 
year in October, 2019.  It was reviewed, updated, 
and presented to faculty and the School Site Council on October 17, 2019.

place of more than 40 specific funding categories, the new model has established three sources of state funding with 
increased local 
discretion to determine how best to spend those funds in the service of students.  All districts receive a 
BASE of per
-
student funding that varies slightly depending on grade level.  All districts also receive SUPPLEMENTAL 
funding.  IUSD has used BASE and 
SUPPLEMENTAL funding to support the following programs:
 
 
Site Programs and Services:  1) Support professional learning and teacher coaching through induction program, content 
TOSAs and teacher mentor program , 2) provide summer school and summer athletic p
rograms, 3) Allocating site funding 
and staffing to support student achievement through support of Professional Learning Communities (PLC) and site PLC 
coaches, 4) Elementary P.E. paraprofessionals, 5) Support for English language learners, 6) Elementary s
cience, music, and 
art programs, 7) Purchase textbooks and instructional materials, 8) Develop a technology rich learning environment 
including; Technology matching programs, Technology Maintenance fund and site technology support staff, 9) Maintain 
previo

Finally, CONCENTRATION grant funding 
equal to 50 percent of the base is provided to districts in which English
-
learners, 
low
-
income students and foster youth exceed 55 percent of the total enrollment.  Irvine Unified School District is not 
eligible for concentration funding because its enroll
ment does not exceed the 55 percent threshold.

supports students in small group instruction based on targeted skill deficits.  We also have Title 1 instructional assistants
 
wh
o provide small group intervention and support as well.
 
 
Giving teachers time to develop in the PLC continuum is most needed. Then, assessments can be  aligned to give better 
information for intervention.
