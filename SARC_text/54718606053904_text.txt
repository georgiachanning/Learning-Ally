About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report C
ard (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LC
FF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Cutler School participates in a 90
-
minute staff development and collaboration period through a 

in grade level Professional Learning Communities to focus on Common Core Standards, student data, and on learning strategies 
that make a difference 
in student achievement. Once a month, at our all staff 
PLC meetings, the leadership team provides the  staff with training on school wide strategies, 
differentiated instruction, growth mindset, teacher clarity, and other beneficial topics. Extended Professional Development d
ays are built into the teacher 
contr
acts and add an additional 15 hours of learning based on the specific needs of the students. The teachers also receive profes
sional development 
through lesson studies on different learning strategies facilitated by the academic coaches throughout the schoo
l year. Teachers receive professional 
development from district
-
wide in
-
service training and other opportunities offered from outside partners. Tulare County Office of Education has provided 
many and varied in
-
service workshops which our staff have chosen 
to attend. Professional development covers major subjects (Reading, Writing, 
Language, Math, Close Reading strategies and Assessments) strategies to support English Learners, technology use and Special 
Education. All teachers 
have been trained in the 4Cs, 
4Ls, Learning Targets and DOK. All teachers were provided training on the new English Learner Common Core Standards. 
Para
-
professionals and volunteers participate in trainings to increase their skill level in supporting students to meet or exceed 
grade
-
lev
el standards. 
Teachers have been trained in Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD) to ensure great instruction the first time. Our prima
ry area of focus is reading. 
Our data shows that many of our students are not reading at grade level. Our goal is to 
have every student on grade level by the time they enter third 
grade. Our teachers were provided with training on how to use Fountas and Pinnell, Running Records and small group leveled re
ading instruction to 
better serve our students. Walkthroughs are con
ducted by the leadership team and administration on a weekly basis. Instructional Coaches facilitate 
lesson studies, coaching cycles, and provide extra training for teachers who need more assistance based on walkthrough data o
r teacher request.
