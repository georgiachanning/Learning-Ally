By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Corona Elementary School was built in 1964 with various additions to permanent structures completed in 1967. Our school 
has adequate space for teaching and learning which includes 34 classrooms. There are three permanent classroom wings. 
In addition, Coron
a has 13 portable classrooms that were installed between the years of 1968 and 2008. One of these 
portables is the school library that also provides a space for instructional purposes when needed. The main office building 
includes the front office, princip
al's office, elementary administrator's office, health office, conference room, work room 
and staff lounge. Two small storage rooms on the campus have been renovated and turned into a small classroom and 
additional office space.
 
 
Corona has a large field a
nd four different areas with adequate playground equipment to allow for positive student 
engagement. We have 8 student restrooms; all with toilets and sinks in proper working conditions. During the 2007
-
2008 
and 2008
-
2009 school years, Corona underwent a m
odernization project that addressed California State Code Accessibility 
by providing accessible restroom facilities, working space and sinks in classrooms, drinking fountains, paths of travel 
including ramps and curb cuts, passenger loading zones, bus drop
-
off, parking, and signage. Panic hardware was installed 
on doors, and new door thresholds were also part of this project.

Our school facility offers a positive learning environment will fully functioning lighting, heating and cooling systems, and 
noise negation. Internet access is available in all offices and classrooms. Each primary grade classroom has between four 
and six student computers. The upper grade classrooms each have their own computer cart with individually
-
assigned 
student computers. 
All Corona classrooms have a Smartboard, document camera, and printer. The district Information 
Services Department maintains a content filter for all Internet traffic, including E
-
mail, in accordance with the Children's 
Internet Protection Act (CIPA) guid
elines.
 
 
Student Safety
 
Students are supervised immediately before and after school by staff. All students, parents, and other visitors enter the 
school through the front gates each morning. All visitors must check in at the front office and wear a visitor
's badge to 
show proof that they have come through the office. District employees and substitutes all wear district
-
issued 
identification badges. Students who are leaving early must be checked out through the front office by parents or 
guardians. All staff
 
members are diligent about being aware of adults on campus at all times. Visitors without badges are 
escorted to the office.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. Corona Elemen
tary School is 
maintained in a manner that assures it is clean and that all facilities are in good working order. The district works with 
custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules that ensure all classrooms, offices, and restrooms are cleaned daily. 
Re
stroom checks are done periodically throughout the school day. Staff and students work to maintain an orderly, clean, 
graffiti and litter
-
free school of which all can be proud.
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, a
nd functional. Site and district maintenance and 
grounds staff make sure that the work necessary to keep the school in good repair and aesthetically pleasing is completed 
in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that
 
emergency repairs are given the 
highest priority. The floors, walls, and plumbing are all in good shape.
 
 
The district's Operations Department conducts an annual in
-
depth evaluation of each school to determine the condition 
of the facilities and identify 
situations that need maintenance, repair, or an upgrade. The district uses a facility survey 
instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction to assist with the data gathering 
during the inspections. All findings are sha
red with the principal and work orders for needed repairs are created at that 
time. The results of this survey are available at the school office or the district office.
 
 
The last state inspection mandated under the Williams Settlement was completed on Dec
ember 2018. The report on this 
inspection was forwarded to the Superintendent of Schools. Any areas of concern noted by the team were corrected as 
reflected elsewhere in this report. Deficiencies listed as (remedied) were corrected at the time of inspectio
n.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Corona School believes 

Consequently, we take pride in creating multiple opportunities for parents to be involved in the school. If you are 
interested in participating in any of the following 
activities, please contact the school at (909) 984
-
6411.
 

 
Coffee with the Principal: Once a month parents are invited to discuss many of the issues surrounding the school. 
This is a structured way of becoming informed and having your voice heard. Meetings a
re held in both English 
and Spanish. Representatives of the different parent groups including PTO, SELPAC and School Site Council 
provide quick updates to parents and ask for feedback. These meetings also are topic oriented. Each session 
includes a specifi
c topic such as Discipline, College Awareness, How to be a Better Parent, How to Help Your 
Child with Homework and other topics that are taken from our school parent survey.
 

 
School Site Council (SSC): The School Site Council is an elected decision making b
ody of the school and is directly 
involved in the planning and reviewing of the school plan. At least one member serves on the District Advisory 
Council. Parents may run for election for open School Site Council seats on a yearly basis. These meetings are 
open to the public.
 

 
Site English Learner Parent Advisory Council (SELPAC): The SELPAC advises the school on programs and services 
for English Language Learners. At least one member from SELPAC serves on the District English Learner Parent 
Advisory Committe
e (DELPAC).
 

 
Parent Teacher Organization (PTO): The PTO meets on a monthly basis to help provide support to our 
instructional program. The PTO is involved in helping organize school events, fundraisers and supports our 
school activities.
 

 
Classroom and Schoo
l Parent Volunteer Program: Corona School is well known for parent involvement and 
parent volunteers. We highly encourage our parent community to become involved as school volunteers. Many 
student events and activities would not be possible without our par
ent volunteer help. Classrooms have parent 
or community volunteers who help in many different ways throughout the year. We also have parents that help 
plan and coordinate school activities throughout the year. Parents wishing to volunteer must fill out an 
application, have a tuberculosis test (TB), go through a short training, and comply with volunteer requirements.

School Safety 
Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Corona Elementary School's primary goal is to maintain a safe and orderly environment for students and staff. During the 
2018
-
2019 school year, Corona revised its disaster response plan and created new disaster response teams. 
The plan was 
reviewed again at the start of the school year in August of 2019 with the staff. The staff at Corona continually update this 
plan. We also organize necessary materials as appropriate and implement disaster training for all staff members.
 
 
This
 
school holds monthly safety drills including fire drills, active shooter/intruder drills, and drop/cover earthquake drills. 
Corona maintains a health aide and part
-
time nurse to deal with student illness and emergencies.

The Ontario
-
Montclair School District (OMSD) offers 
research
-
based, on
-
going professional development for certificated, 
classified, and management employees aligned with the district's long
-
term goals. Professional development is designed 
to help employees enhance  their knowledge and develop needed skills 
to provide quality services in order to maximize 
student learning and achievement. Professional development courses and programs are developed and coordinated 
through the district's Robert Hardy Professional Development Center as well as at our school site
. The focus of all 
professional development is based on the instructional and management priorities in the goals and objectives of our 
strategic and school improvement plans.
 
 
Professional development at the site and district levels addresses the core curr
iculum, instructional strategies, standards
-
based instruction, and classroom management. In addition, the district level professional development includes workshop 
sessions and classroom support for beginning teachers (BTSA), courses for teachers working o
n their teaching credentials, 
technology training, and a variety of job
-
specific and mandated training for classified employees.
 
 
Corona and OMSD are implementing professional development for all teachers on the Common Core State Standards 
(CCSS) for Engli
sh Language Arts and mathematics as well as Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). As part of our 
Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Supports, teachers are supported in implementing classroom and Student Success Team 
interventions using the P4SS system. Teachers a
re trained to use a universal screener and are supported by the 
instructional coach to develop focused intervention instruction.
 
 
Corona Elementary follows district policy in the area of staff development and teacher training. Teachers meet on the 
first, t
hird and fourth Tuesday of each month for staff development and instructional training. This training includes the 
latest research
-
based instructional methods in English Language Arts, ELD, mathematics, science, and social science. 
Teachers and administrat
ors also use this time for in
-
depth analysis of student achievement data on state, local, and 
classroom assessments and benchmarks. The staff also meets on the second Tuesday of every month to plan instruction, 
analyze student data, and learn and discuss t
eaching strategies. Finally, teachers are given a planning day after each district 
benchmark to analyze data and collaborate on an instructional plan. This time serves as a platform for teachers to target 
necessary re
-
teach and extension activities in orde
r to extend all students to their fullest potential.
