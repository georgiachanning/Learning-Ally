By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM) focus has integrated skills such as computer science coding into 

s a place where students 
explore and engineer solutions that will enhance society.  Students learn and apply the engineering design process to solve 
real
-
world problems.  The Launch Pad also serves as a Makerspace
-
 
a space for students to explore and disco
ver new 
ideas, a space for students to enhance their creativity.  Our Makerspace provides students with a place where they can 
create something that aligns with their passion, a place where students can unleash the genius within them.  Our learning 
center 
provides additional educational opportunities for our students.  Classrooms are equipped with integrated 
technology systems to engage students in learning.  Buena Terra is committed to meeting the needs of all students through 
explicit direct instruction a
nd differentiated instruction.  With input from the School Site Council, the staff continues to 
implement the District's model for a Comprehensive School Based Coordinated Plan that focuses on measurable objectives 
for program improvement and student achie
vement while building on an analysis of the previous year's data. Our 
curriculum and instructional focus for the next few years will be directed toward the implementation of the new California 
Common Core Standards.  Buena Terra is a proud recipient of the
 
California Business for Education Excellence STEM Honor 
Roll School.
 
 
At Buena Terra, we provide a warm, welcoming culture for students, teachers, parents, and community.  Parents are 
encouraged to volunteer in the school, are invited to Principal Chats, 
and are kept up to date with weekly messages. Buena 
Terra has implemented the PBIS program for several years now and is committed to providing a multi
-
tiered framework 
that supports a rich learning environment for students.  This structure allows for the i
nput from all of our stakeholders, 
especially students, to create a safe, nurturing school environment for all.  In 2019, Buena Terra received a Platinum 
ranking from the California PBIS Coalition's System of Recognition and was selected as a California Di
stinguished School. 
Parents and community members feel a part of the school and we have been able to expand events and services provided 
to the Buena Terra family. Our PTA has won numerous City awards for participation in City events.  We are proud of our 
active participation by parents with large numbers of parents volunteering in the classrooms.

In 2011, the Gover

instructional materials until the 2015

16 school year (Education Code Section 60200.7).  At this time the State has adopted 
frameworks for English Language Art
s/ English Language Development, and math which will assist in our implementation 
of  California's Common Core State Standards. We are currently piloting  State Board of Education adopted (January, 2014) 
instructional materials for math to reflect the rigo
r of the California's Common Core State Standards, teachers are 
developing curricula units, and various resources are provided as additional instructional materials. The State Board of 
Education adopted ELA/ ELD instructional materials in November 2015  wh
ich directed our pilot and adoption of new 
instructional materials.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The  Centralia School 
District welcomes and values parental involvement in District and school programs.   During the 
2019
-
20 school year, CESD continued the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) process.   This new funding process 
requires school districts to engage parents
, teachers, employee groups, and the wider community to be a part of the 
development of the LCAP.   Informational meetings were held with various stakeholders including Board members, 
parents, PTAs, and advisory groups (DELAC, GATE, PTA).   An LCAP committ
ee was formed that included representatives 
from each stakeholder group. The culmination of the LCAP committee was the adoption of the LCAP by the Board of 
Trustees.  The LCAP represents an opportunity to further strengthen the commitments between our Dist
rict and our 
community on behalf of all of the students.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement:
 
Many family and community members volunteer at the school and participate as decision
-
makers. Buena Terra is unique 
in that the community involvement is endle
ss and that the students feel the support and encouragement they need to be 
successful. Many family and community members volunteer at the school and participate as decision
-
makers.  District

teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a school
