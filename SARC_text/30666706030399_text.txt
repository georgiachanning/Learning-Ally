School Description
 
Theodore Roosevelt Elementary (Roosevelt Elementary) is a K
-
5 elementary school located at the 
corner of South Halladay Street and East Chestnut Avenue in the city of 
Santa Ana.
 
 
School Mission:
 
The mission of Roosevelt Elementary is to provide and promote high academics for all students. 
We encourage our children to make connections between new learning and prior knowledge. We 
believe that students should know what sta
ndards are expected of them and achieve them. 
Children thrive when expectations are high. Children learn best when they are in a clean, safe and 
caring environment.  At Roosevelt Elementary we make connections with our parents, families, and 
community. We 
support our student's learning life, social skills and academics.  Roosevelt provides 
opportunities for our students to become successful, productive citizens of the 21st century.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

S
marter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligi
ble students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical
