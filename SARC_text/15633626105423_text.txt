Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

e Laurelglen Tennis Club was one of the first establishments built in the area and 

a nine

instructional program that is intellectually
 
stimulating, academically challenging, prepares them for a successful future in 
work and school and addresses the needs of each student as an individual.  Laurelglen has a strong tradition of parental

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Laurelglen provides a 
safe and clean environment for learning. A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the 
District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are maintained to a degree of adequacy that provides for good learning.
 
Ongoing repairs and modifications 

Coordinator of Safety and Risk Management verifies quarterly that OSHA requirements are met. The exterior grounds are 
well lit and the perimeter of the school facility is fen
ced for student protection and safety. A team of custodians ensures 
classrooms and campus grounds are kept clean and safe. The restrooms are cleaned, sanitized and secured at the end of 
each school day with 100% of the toilets in operating condition. As ou
tlined in our Safe Schools Plan, the safety committee 
has addressed concerns for the safe coming and going of our students. Staff receive inservice in emergency protocol and 
CPR. District ID and visitor badges are issued to substitute teachers, volunteers,
 
and other visitors as they register in our 
office. The gates on the perimeter of the school playground are locked during school hours and staff members are trained 
to activate lock down procedures in the event of an emergency. Our positive partnership wit
h local law enforcement is 
evident in their quick response time when concerns arise. Designated staff members carefully supervise students on the 
playground and in the cafeteria. Grounds and playground equipment are inspected regularly for potential hazard
s. The 
District provides on
-
going training in CPR/First Aid as part of its staff development program. Fire and/or disaster drills 
occur monthly and a complete school site disaster plan has been prepared and is in place and available for public review. 
Sche
duled certificated supervision of students begins officially at 7:50 a.m. when the school opens and supervision ends 
at 3:15 p.m.
