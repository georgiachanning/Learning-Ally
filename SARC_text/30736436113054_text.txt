By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountabilit
y Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accou
ntability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the
 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about th
e LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the 
school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains addit
ional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enr
ollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and publi
c locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a w
orkstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The mission statement at TRE sets the 
tone for high academ
ic standards for student achievement in a 21st Century learning 
environment. As the district introduced the Common Core State Standards (CCSS), TRE staff turned into trailblazers as we 
identified the need to shift our teaching practices
 
to meet the rigor a
nd high expectations of the new standards. With the 
use of technology as an additional instructional tool, teachers provide strong instructional practices. Our staff strengthens
 
their instructional practices through powerful professiona
l development and le
arning in a culture where teachers utilize 
a growth mindset to seek current research
-
based best practices. Teachers collaborate weekly to develop interactive 
approaches to teaching that invite students in a technology
-
enhanced learning 
environment. Our cor
e belief is that all 
students can and will succeed. Teachers and parents work together in a collaborative culture to provide enrichment 
opportunities to support academics. TRE staff provides differentiated instruction within a caring an
d supportive campus 
climate with flexible learning spaces and integrated technology.
 
 
TRE is proud to be named an OC Tech Alliance Innovation School, a two
-
time CA State Gold Standard PBIS school, and two
-
time CA Gold Ribbon School. The top curricular goal
s for TRE are:
 
1.
 
Pr
ovide a rigorous and challenging curriculum in English Language Arts and Mathematics through engaging 
strategies and technology integration
 
2.
 
Provide instruction and intervention for students in Wellness and Social Skills to maintain and ref
ine a strong 
p
ositive school culture.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Tustin Unified School District takes 
great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in 
this effor
t, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School 
Construction (OPSC). The results of this survey 
are available at the school office, the District office, or on the Internet at 
https://tinyurl.co

Tool. The District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to 
keep the school in good repair and working order are comp
leted in a timely manner. A work order process is used to 
ensure efficient service and that emerg
ency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Tustin Ranch Elementary School was built in 1995.  The school site accommodates over 680 students.  The TUSD 
main
tenance and grounds personnel maintain our facility and grounds with care.  Our school library cu
rrently has over 
10,000 books.  There is an adjacent  Sports Park, which provides additional areas for Physical Education, surrounds the 
playground and is util
ized for other school
-
related events.  Our award
-
winning facility is a model for technology with 
over 
450 devices in classrooms, hallways, and in the STEAM lab.  We are also very proud to have Smart Boards, voice 
amplification systems, and document cameras
 
in every classroom throughout the school.  We are proud of our state of 
the art facility.

State Priority: Pupil

The SARC pr

Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessmen
ts for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the
 
administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have s
uccessfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State pri

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input
 
in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There are many 
opportunities in the district for parental involvement through participation in parent surveys, support 
organi
zations, booster clubs, school site councils, DELAC and district
-
level advisory committees with the superintendent.
 
 
Parents at the school partici
pate in activities. There are many opportunities for our parents to become involved in the 
school.  The staff 
is eager for this support and collaboration because parent involvement supports student academic 
success.  Each year, parents attend Back to Schoo
l Night, two annual parent conferences, and Open House in the spring.  
Parents are encouraged to support their
 
child at home academically.  Additionally, we are fortunate to have many parents 
who provide support in the classrooms, working with students ind
ividually or in small group settings.  Parents are 
encouraged to join in the school's "Paws for the Cause", ou
r Parent Teacher Association (PTA) which works in close 
partnership with the school staff.  The PTA also sponsors Family Nights throughout the sch
ool year, such as Family Reading, 
Family SEL, Family Math and Family STEAM nights to promote a very positive h
ome
-
school partnership. Our School Site 
Council is composed of both community and staff members and meets regularly to monitor the School Improvem
ent Plan 
and student achievement.
 
For more information on how to become involved at the school, please contact
 
Principal Kathi Denny at (714) 730
