standing tradition of excellence and high expectations from its 
community.  Since the late 1800s, Clay School has retained a mark on the map of south Fresno 
County and the greater Kingsburg community.  The Clay School staff is one of exceptional 
experience and loyalty to the school district.  Representing the community
 
are three Governing 
Board trustees.  Clay School has been recognized as both a California Distinguished School and 
National Blue Ribbon School.  The committed staff provides outstanding learning experiences for 
all students, and the curriculum is aligned 
to the California Common Core State Standards.

Student and parent engagement at Clay School cultivates the educational environment where 
students can thrive and succeed.  Parent articulation and participation in ways to improve Clay 
School is sought at monthly P
arent Club meetings, Parent Advisory meetings, annual Parent
-
Teacher Conferences, and informal Parent
-
Teacher encounters.  Additionally, every year, an 
anonymous parent survey is provided to each family, whose responses are analyzed by the CJESD 
School Boa
rd, Superintendent/Principal, teachers, and staff who search for areas of improvement 
in the educational environment.  Parents are on
-
campus volunteering in classrooms, Fall Festival, 
and Jog

School Night, Open House, and Parent
-
Teacher Conferences are well 
attended.  Student engagement academically is key to a successful educational environment by 
eliminating poor attendance and suspension/expulsio

a Positive Behavior Intervention System, which are proven to engage students academically and 
reduce negative attendance patterns and suspension/expulsions.

dedicated to the success of all students as demonstrated by student achievement on formative and 
summative assessments.  At designated intervals, formative assessments are administered to monitor student progress toward th
e 
acquisition of the CCSS in Engli
sh Language Arts and Math, with support from classroom teachers and the reading intervention teacher.  
Beginning 2015 and each year thereafter, all students in grades 3
-
8 participate in the Common Core
-
aligned CAASPP summative 
assessment to measure academi
c achievement.  ALL students are expected to make growth, and 85% of ALL students are expected to 
perform at or above grade level (proficiency).  English Language Learners are expected to attain English Language Proficiency
, as measured 
by the ELPAC. As ev
idenced by our 2019 dashboard result of BLUE in 4 categories for the first time; Mathematics, English Language Arts, 
Chronic Absenteeism and Suspension Rate, it is our goal to maintain this level of excellence for the students and community o
f Clay Joint 
E
lementary.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Unde
r the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific acti
vities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca

School Safety Plan
 
Our School Safety Plan has three main components, which include personal characteristics of students and staff, the school's 
physical environment, and 
the sc
hool's social environment.  Our Plan addresses the school response to earthquake, Fire, and/or intruders.  In addition to add
ressing emergency 
responses, our plan calls for regular practices.  Drills for fire are conducted each month, and drills for earthq
uake/intruders/evacuation are conducted at 
least two times each year.  Our School Safety plan was last reviewed, updated, and discussed in  January 2019.  Also, Visitor
s must sign in.  First aid, CPR
