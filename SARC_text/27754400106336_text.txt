Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Mission:
 
Frank 
Ledesma's mission is to provide a safe, nurturing environment in which all students learn the essential grade level 
Common Core State Standards, and demonstrate appropriate behavior, to become critical, creative thinkers, and 
independent problem solvers in
 
a diverse society.
 
 
Vision Statement:
 
At Frank Ledesma Elementary we will create a safe learning environment where the school and community collaborate to 
develop our diverse students to become 21st Century Learners and responsible 
decision
-
makers.
 
 
This year's initiatives are to:
 

 
Continue our focus on writing and short written responses using our school writing approach K
-
6.
 

 
Increase the intensive instruction in phonics and phonemic awareness for primary students.
 

 
Continue to Implem
ent the Common Core State Standards (focus on essential standards) for reading, language 
arts, and math.
 

 
Implement highly effective daily Math Talks and use Close Reading and our writing strategy within the math 
curriculum.
 

 
Increased Rigor throughout our Curriculum and Instructional practices. More Rigor in what the students are 
actually doing and learning.
 

 
Continue to implement and refine our practices in Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports. Refine Tier 1 
practices 
and develop Tier 2 & 3 supports. Implement Zones of Regulation.
 

 
Continue to conduct data analysis with our NWEA K
-
2, Reading Inventory,  progress monitoring assessments, 
Essential Standards Common Formative Assessments, and CAASPP Interim ICAs.
 

 
Continue gr
ade level planning during PLC using the Team Teaching and Assessment Cycle referenced by Solution 
Tree. Decisions we make will be based on data.
 

 
Continue to involve our parents through PTO, ELAC, School Site Council, and our growing partnerships with Save 
the Whales and the Butterfly Garden programs.
 

 
Increase the effectiveness and student use of computer assisted learning and intervention programs.

Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud
y.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff 
Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Both formal and informal staff development is available to the staff members of Frank Ledesma Elementary School. There 
are two days of staff development prior to the opening of the school year, and two days planned during the school year . 
There is a forma
l course of study for the entire staff during the school year. We have staff development every week during 
our staff meetings.  Every Wednesday the staff meets in grade level teams as part of the Professional Learning Community 
(PLC) to determine the next 
approach to the curriculum, review student successes and needs, and to review district 
assessments. Teachers also use this time to develop essential standards based lesson plans.
 
 
A formal Staff Development Plan is developed each year to ensure that the st
aff development is an on going program for 
our staff. Copies of the Frank Ledesma Staff Development Plan are available for examination at the school.
