About
 
the
 
SARC
 
By
 
February
 
1
 
of
 
each
 
year,
 
every
 
school
 
in
 
California
 
is
 
required
 
by
 
state
 
law
 
to
 
publish
 
a
 
School
 
Accountability
 
Report
 
Card
 
(SARC).
 
The
 
SARC
 
contains
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
condition
 
and
 
performance
 
of
 
each
 
California
 
public
 
school.
 
Under
 
the
 
Local
 
Control
 
Funding
 
Formula
 
(LCFF)
 
all
 
local
 
educational
 
agencies
 
(LEAs)
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
prepare
 
a
 
Local
 
Control
 
and
 
Accountability
 
Plan
 
(LCAP),
 
which
 
describes
 
how
 
they
 
intend
 
to
 
meet
 
annual
 
school-specific
 
goals
 
for
 
all
 
pupils,
 
with
 
specific
 
activities
 
to
 
address
 
state
 
and
 
local
 
priorities.
 
Additionally,
 
data
 
reported
 
in
 
an
 
LCAP
 
is
 
to
 
be
 
consistent
 
with
 
data
 
reported

Policy
 
 
2019-2020
 
 
There
 
are
 
many
 
opportunities
 
for
 
parent
 
involvement
 
at
 
Richland.
 
We
 
strongly
 
believe
 
that
 
parents,
 
in
 
partnership
 
with
 
the
 
staff,
 
can
 
and
 
do
 
make
 
a
 
real
 
difference
 
in
 
the
 
success
 
of
 
their
 
children
 
at
 
school.
 
Our
 
tagline
 
is
 
a
 
quote
 
by
 
the
 
Dalai
 
Lama
 
that
 
states,
 
"It
 
is
 
vital
 
that
 
when
 
educating
 
our
 
children™s
 
brains
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
neglect
 
to
 
educate
 
their
 
hearts."
 
We
 
are
 
creating
 
an
 
inclusive
 
environment
 
where
 
ALL
 
children
 
work
 
together
 
and
 
learn
 
from
 
each
 
other
 
as
 
we
 
ﬁgrowﬂ
 
our
 
children™s
 
character
 
and
 
minds.

is
 
committed
 
to
 
the
 
belief

the
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
teacher
 
inside

of
 
this

receives
 
30
 
hours
 
of
 
professional
 
development
 
on
 
our
 
research-based
 
instructional
 
framework,
 
the
 
Essential
 
Elements
 
of

(EEI).
 
These
 
instructional
 
strategies
 
apply
 
to
 
any
 
curricular
 
area
 
and
 
any
 
grade
 
level.
 
New

the
 
District
