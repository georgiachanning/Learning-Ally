School Description
 
 
Principal's Message
 
Paddison
 
Elementary School is located at 12100 Crewe Street in Norwalk.  Paddison is a 
neighborhood school with deep roots in the Norwalk community.  We have over 400 students 
attending transitional kindergarten through fifth grade.  Many of our current students h
ave older 
siblings who attended Paddison and have moved on to Lakeside or Lake Center Middle School.  
Some of our current students' parents were Paddison Panthers themselves.  Families trust that 
their children will succeed at Paddison.  According to our a
nnual parent satisfaction survey, 97% of 
parents who responded to the survey were satisfied with Paddison as their child's school and 97% 
of respondents reported that there is good school
-
parent communication
 
 
Funds made available by our district and 
site
-
based Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP), make 
it possible for our school to provide a phenomenal educational environment where all members of 
our school community pursue excellence.  Supplemental Concentration LCAP funds give us access 
to suppl
emental materials and make it possible for our staff to engage in meaningful professional 
development. We also use the funds to support student interventions and supports. It is a priority 
to promote student motivation and support parent involvement initia
tives relevant to our school 
community.  All of these elements are essential as we aim for the highest academic expectations.  
To support us in that endeavor, we foster a safe space in which our students develop socially and 
emotionally.  We promote school
-
wide positive behaviors that maximize students' opportunities to 
be safe, responsible, respectful and kind.
 
 
We have a longstanding tradition of excellence.  The California Department of Education recognized 
Paddison Elementary School as a 2020 California
 
Distinguished School.  The Educational Results 
Partnership along with the Campaign for Business and Educational Excellence identified Paddison 
as an Honor Roll School for the 2018
-
2019 school year. In 2016, we celebrated Gold Ribbon School 
recognition.  T
he California Department of Education had, in 2012, named Paddison a Distinguished 
School and, in that year, we also received the Title I Academic Achievement Award.  We are very 
proud of the work that goes into receiving each recognition.
 
 
Paddison Panthe
rs are a proud family. Our motto embodies our spirit of continuous improvement 

 
 
As Always, Go Panthers!

About the SARC
 
By Febru
ary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fundi
ng Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state a
nd local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the sch
ool, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Paddison
 
Elementary School has 18 regular classrooms, 9 portable classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library, and an administration bui
lding. The main 
campus was built in 1957. Additions were constructed in 1997 and 2001. In 2008

2009, the new telephone system and 
public address system were 
installed. Landscape projects include planting grass in many dry patch areas for aesthetic purposes. Our expansive fields and
 
play structures are 
maintained in good condition all year long. Outdoor lighting and wireless internet 
were installed throughout the campus this year.
 
 
Our two custodians clean each classroom every other day on an A/B schedule and the restrooms every day. District maintenance 
picks up litter, removes 
graffiti, and maintains landscaping on a regular weekly s
chedule. Projects for 2013
-
14 include obtaining wireless internet access school
-
wide.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the
 
Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will
 
find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical systems, heating 
and ventilation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe 
and in good repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs.
 
 
The guidelines for this assessment were written by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were br
ought about by the Williams legislation. 
You can look at the six
-
page Facilities Inspection Tool used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Invo
lvement (School Year 2019
-

At Paddison Elementary School, we value the contributions parents make to their children's education.  Paddison's Local Contr
ol Accountability Plan 
-
 
Parent Involvement (Supplemental Concentration LCAP #28) funds make it possi
ble to financially support parent involvement efforts. With the funds, we 
purchase incentives and materials for family events and parents meetings.  During the 2019
-
2020 school year, for example, we used LCAP #28 to help 
fund a Family Math Festival.  Famil
ies are encouraged to attend important academic and social events scheduled throughout the school year such as our 
Family Math Festival, Back to School Night, Paddison's Jog
-
A
-
Thon, our Winter Program, Open House, Dads & Donuts/Moms & Muffins and our annua
l 
festivals.  These events provide families an opportunity to experience aspects of our educational program and celebrate our s
tudents' achievements.  We 
strive to welcome families to our campus.  Our annual Parent Satisfaction Survey data shows that 97% o
f respondents confirm that they feel welcomed 
by the staff when they visit the school.  Parents meet with teachers and discuss their children's academic progress during pa
rent
-
teacher conferences, 
which take place in the fall for all students.  Conferences
 
also take place in the spring, providing the opportunity for parents and teachers of children who 
are academically at
-
risk to meet and discuss important situations and work together on next steps for improving academic achievement.  Parents of
 
students wh
o are at
-
risk also participate in Student Study Team (SST)  meetings. Parents of student with disabilities participate in Individual E
ducation 
Plan (IEP) meetings.  Parents of our English Learners who have met criteria for reclassification meet with the te
acher and/or the  principal to discuss what 
reclassification means and how parents can continue to support their child's academic achievement.  When surveyed, 97% of par
ents are pleased with 
the progress their child is making towards meeting state standard
s.  97% of respondents are satisfied with Paddison as their child's school.
 
 
We recognizes all families as partners.  First and foremost, we acknowledge that families support their children at home.  We
 
honor the contribution that 
parents and other family 
members make from home and we maintain communication via newsletters, notes, emails, and phone calls as needed.  We are 
intentional and diligent in fostering communication between home and school.  100% of parents who responded to our annual Par
ent Engagem
ent 
Survey confirm that they communicate with their child's teacher or other school personnel regarding their child's progress.  
Some parents and 
grandparents are able to partner with us as Volunteers.  Volunteers are able to commit time during the school 
day to help with special events, help as 
chaperones, and give time with projects on campus.  Some parents are willing and able to commit to school leadership and gove
rnance.  These parents 
attend and participate in meetings including our  School Site Counc

School Safety Plan
 
Safety is a primary goal at Paddison Elementary School.  Paddison has a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP) that is updat
ed for the 2019
-
2020 
school ye
ar.  Paddison's Comprehensive School Safety Plan documents the practices and procedures we have in place to keep students and
 
staff safe
--
physically, socially, and emotionally.  Our practices and procedures are communicated to parents as needed and when it
 
is appropriate. The majority of 
our parents agree that Paddison provides a safe environment for students, 94% according to our parent survey.  Our annual Hea
lthy Kids Survey asks 
fifth grade students if they feel safe at school.  Survey results for the 20
18
-
2019 school year indicate that 99% of 5th graders felt safe at school.  92% 
reported feeling connected to someone at school.  For the 2019
-
2020 school year, we are striving to increase the number of students who feel safe at 
school and are connected to 
someone at school.
 
 
The CSSP
 
includes emergency procedures for a variety of disasters including earthquakes, lock
-
downs, and other potential emergencies.  The document 
identifies exit route locations, response plans, and protocols to maximize safety for students, staff, and school vi
sitors.  The document is reviewed with 
staff each school year and with parent during our School Site Council (SSC) meeting.  The plan is available in the school off
ice.  We practice fire drills once 
a month, earthquake drills three times a year, and annual
ly train staff on emergency preparedness.  Our training and planning is put to practice every 
year when our entire school community participates in a district
-
wide disaster drill.  The exercise provides us the opportunity to discuss emergency 
preparedness 
with all our students and their families.  Our school district has taken the lead on providing us with information and traini
ng on the most 
difficult situations including active shooter training.
 
 
Our school plan outlines daily practices that help keep our
 
students and staff safe.  Paddison is a closed campus. There is one point of entry for students 
at the beginning of the school day.  The point of entry is open from 7:45am, when students enter the cafeteria for breakfast,
 
until 8:15am, when the door 
close
s.  Students arriving after 8:15am enter through the main office where their late entry is logged.  Adults are not allowed on
 
campus during morning 
drop
-
off or after
-
school pick
-
up.  Families are able to say good
-
bye to their children in the morning from o
utside the school gates and families wait for 
their children to be dismissed outside of the school gates.  Visitors sign
-
in at the main office.  Students who participate in after
-
school programs are 
closely monitored by program supervisors and picked
-
up by
 
their parents at designated times and via designated spaces.  The campus supervisors and 
principal monitor the campus facilities on a daily basis.  Besides physical safety, our CSSP includes an overall plan for pro
moting a positive school climate 
and supp
ort students' social and emotional health.  Paddison's staff implement Positive Behaviors Interventions and Supports (PBIS), 
a system of practices 
for engaging all members of the school community in abiding by clearly stated behavior expectations. Paddison
's Local Control Accountability Plan 
-
 
Student Motivation (Supplemental Concentration LCAP #33) funds make it possible for us to secure PBIS student incentives.  In
 
addition to PBIS, we 
implement a social emotional curriculum school
-
wide; we use Second Ste
p.  All the adults on campus take responsibility in maintaining a safe and kind 
school campus.  In the event that there are conflicts, adults incuding teachers or othe principal facilitate conflict resolut
ion sessions.  The adults on 
campus teach children 
that communication and kindness are essential elements in resolving conflict.  When surveyed, 94% of parents agree that 
Paddison's school
-
wide discipline policy is effective.
 
 
At Paddison, we know that students are positioned to engage academically when th
ey feel safe and if their social and emotional needs are met.  We have 
a referral process to ensure all students in need of help are linked to appropriate support services.  We have a Student Stud
y Team (SST) that takes 
referrals for students in need of ac
ademic support and or social/emotional support.  The SST monitors student progress.  When emotional support is 
needed, we link the student and their family to, when possible, school
-
based services.  We facilitate the connection between students and the res
ource 
that best meets their needs.  We work with Turning Point interns, our school
-
based counselor and, when necessary, we will refer cases to service provider 
in the community.

educators pursue continuous improvement.  All teachers and the principal engage in ongoing professional learning.  Data Refle
ction Sessions 
(DRS) are our professional learning community platform.  DRS takes place once a week at Paddison Elementary School.
  
Sessions are organized by grade 
level with grades TK
-
2 and 3
-
5 meeting alternating weeks.  Student work and other formative assessment data are analyzed.  What we learn from DRS 
informs our instruction and helps identify areas of need both for student in
terventions and professional development.  LCAP #7 funds make it possible 
to release teachers to collaborate by grade level and also to participate in vertical articulation.  Led by our School Achiev
ement Leadership Team (SALT), 
we hone in on specific evid
ence
-
based strategies to consistently implement across focus areas.  We also focused our attention and instruction on 
increasing academic rigor across every grade level.  Our SALT members have been critical in guiding our learning in Depths of
 
Knowledge (D
OK) and 
Thinking Maps.  Site professional development includes our general education teachers and our special education teachers coll
aborating to bridge the 
achievement gap between general education students and students with disabilites.  Dedicated collab
oration time makes it possible for teachers to 
synthesize information from professional developments and identify the ways in which to effectively apply what we have learne
d to improve our practices 
and increase student learning.
 
 
District support makes it
 
possible for new teachers work with district coaches, participating in math and English Language Arts coaching cycles.  Throu
gh 
the training, they have the opportunity to develop their expertise with evidence
-
based strategies including Comprehensive Early
 
Literacy Learning (CELL)  
and Extended Literacy Learning (ExLL) strategies.  District support also makes it possible for all our teachers and the princ
ipal to participate in Next 
Generation Science Standards' training in collaboration with the UCLA Scienc
e Project.

Types of Services Funded
 
The Little Lake City School District provides additional services for students using federal funds (Title I, Title III, Title
 
IV) and LCAP funds.  Title I funds are 
primarily used to support all students using a Response to Intervention (RtI) model.  At th
e elementary sites, Interventionists are funded to provide 
differentiated instruction to meet the needs of all learners within the RtI model in ELA and mathematics during the school da
y.  At the middle schools, 
Interventionists monitor student academic pro
gress and determine placement for intervention based on student needs.  Title I funds are also used to 
support parent involvement at both the site and district level.  Title III is used to provide supplemental services to all En
glish Learners including add
itional 
tutoring beyond the school day, and professional development for EL Coordinators.  Title IV funds provide students with a wel
l
-
rounded education and 
supports using phenomena in NGSS
-
designed lessons through the creation of NGSS kits.  In addition, 
these funds support safe and healthy students 
through the implementation of a social emotional learning program, Second Step, which is a proactive approach to building ess
ential social and behavioral 
skills.  LCAP Funds are used to supplement services for 
English learners, low income students, and homeless/foster students.  Some actions and services 
include additional counselors, professional development for teachers, supplemental materials, parent engagement opportunities
, and student 
motivation activities
.
