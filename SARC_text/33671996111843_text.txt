Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The 2019
-
2020 school year continues to provide students with 1:1 devices for grades TK 

 
6th. Funding has been allocated 
over recent years for technology.  Palms Elementary School is an AVID Elementary School,  implementing AVID strategi

in the areas of math and language arts.  We provide a rigorous curriculum, guided by the California Standards, in the areas 
of language arts, math, PE, Art, and English Language Development.
 
 
Palms Elementary works together with the School Site Council 
and ELAC to develop the 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement. Data, both CAASPP and district assessments, are used to drive the decisions made to develop goals. Goals 
have been created in the areas of English Language Arts, math, and the increasing achievem
ent of our English Learners. 
Another goal is to create a safe and welcoming environment for staff, students, and parents. Progress is monitored each 
year through parent surveys, district assessments, and state assessments.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Our school was built in 1994. In addition to our 38 regul
ar classrooms, we have four classrooms maintained by Riverside 
County for special needs students, further broadening our opportunities to serve a diverse student population. We also 
have one special education classroom, a 600
-
seat multipurpose room with a 
stage that also serves as an outdoor 
amphitheater, a kitchen, a 2,200
-
square
-
foot media center, an upstairs performance arena, and eight designated student 
services office centers.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an
 
online supplement to this report called for by 
the Williams legislation of 2004. What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their 
structural integrity, electrical systems, heating and ventilation systems, and more. 
The purpose of this assessment is to 
determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good repair.  If anything needs to be repaired, this assessment 
identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to making those repairs. The guidelines for this
 
assessment were 
written by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can 
look at the six
-
page Facilities Inspection Tool used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC.
 
 
Our district routi
nely sends experts from our facilities team to assess the condition of our facilities. The team uses a survey, 
called the Facilities Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction. Based on the survey 
information, we are requi
red to correct any deficiencies.  Please note that the information seen in this report reflects the 
condition of our buildings at the time of the inspection, and since that time, the conditions may have changed.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.

members are instructed on the essential components. All students and staff practice monthly fire, earthquake, or 
lockdown drills. This includes duck and cover and evacuation drills, along with lockdown procedures. We pra
ctice our 
complete school
-

campus with the supplies necessary for an emergency.  In the event of a true emergency, our site utilizes the Blackboard 
Conn

Palms Elementary has video surveillance cameras across our campus as a deterrent to trespassers, vandalism, and other 
illegal activities. They also help administrators and local law enforcement with the investigation of an
