School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by 
state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are re
quired to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is
 
to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/
ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardian
s and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.c
de.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Katherine Edwards Middle School serves approximately 860 students in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students. The majority of 
students live within walking distance of the school, but many students are also bussed in from Pellisie
r and commute from 
Uptown Whittier. Six elementary schools feed into Edwards at the conclusion of 5th grade: West Whittier, Mill, Orange 
Grove, Phelan, Jackson, and Sorensen.  About 50% of Edwards graduates move on to Pioneer High School and 50% go to 
Whit
tier High School. Ninety
-
one percent of the students are Hispanic, 4% White, and 5% other ethnicities.   Approximately 
11% of the total student body are classified as English Language Learners. About 78% of the students receive Free and 
Reduced lunch. Edwa
rds parents have a vast array of occupations, with 70% of the parents holding a high school diploma, 
and of these parents, 30% of those have attended some college and/or received a college degree.
 
 
We have a highly qualified staff that offers a rich standa
rds
-
based curriculum. Our master schedule consists of an 6 period 
day.  Students are offered a variety of electives focused on our school theme, STEAM, such as beginning and advanced 
band, chorus, guitar, engineering, robotics, forensics, coding, college e
xploration and public speaking, student leadership 
(ASB), media art and art. We are also a Dual Immersion Academy where some students take courses in both English (ELA, 
Math, PE, and elective) and Spanish (ELA, Science, Social Studies).   Additionally, stu
dents that require additional support 
in either language arts to meet grade level proficiency are scheduled into an intervention class during the school day.  An 
Honors strand is provided at each grade level for our students excelling in Math and Language 
Arts.  Our school recognizes 
the importance of literacy, therefore, there is a sustained focus on close reading and interacting with the text. Positive 
Behavior Intervention and Support is a focus on the campus to enable students to learn from their action
s and grow in a 
positive learning environment. Students are taught lessons in tolerance, conflict resolution, social skills and individual 
accountability to take responsibility for their actions in helping maintain a safe environment for all students.

supports teaching the CA Common Core Ma
th Standards.  Elementary grades use Eureka Math curriculum, which includes 

CPM curriculum includes student textbooks, online textbooks 

Reading and Writing Units of Study to support reading and writing instruction for all teachers in grades K
-
8. The Reading 
and Writing Units of Study are aligned to the standrads and were designed to 
match the rigor of the new CA Reading and 
Writing Common Core Standards. The District also purchased classroom libraries for each grade level to support the

e foundational reading 
skills needed for early literacy skills. Phonics, Spelling, & Word Study System by Fountas & Pinnell was purchased for grades
 
K
-
3 to help students attend to, learn about, and efficiently use sounds, letters, and words. In addition, C
lassroom Shared 
Reading materials by Fountas & Pinnell were purchased for grades K

process is in place for schools to order materials at the beginning of each school year for all students. In addition, t
here is 
a process to order additional materials throughout the year to address the changing needs of a schools student population, 

cla
sses so appropriate materials can be ordered.  Our school complies with the Williams Law; every child has an 
appropriate textbook for all academic subjects requiring textbooks. Students are allowed to take textbooks home  to study 
after school when needed.
 
The school uses district and categorical funds to provide supplemental materials for classrooms 
including classroom library books, as well as materials for intervention and ELD. Finally, WCSD has an established a 
thorough process for examining new instruc
tional materials as they become available. With the full implementation of 
the California State Standards, the District will use the process to examine, explore, pilot and adopt new curriculum 
materials aligned with the CCSS, with input and feedback from t
eachers, administrators and parents. Based on the 

to ensure that the most appropriate materials are identified for our students.

Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The safety plan is revised each summer at the first staff meeting. This year it was reviewed and updated on August 12th 
and has been revisited as needed during the school year to reflect staff changes. Staff input is sought 
after each drill to 
evaluate its effectiveness and changes to the plan are made as needed to reflect the recommendations (reviewed and 
discussed on September 9th, October 17th, and December 4th).  Additionally, the site Leadership Team reviewed the 
procedu
res after the drills on October 22nd. The school is prepared for the two basic types of major emergencies: building 
evacuation during a fire or earthquake and lockdown/shelter in place. Each type is designated by a different alarm and 
procedures. Each room
 
and office has a red emergency folder clearly visible as well as an emergency supply bucket for 
lock down situations. The emergency folder contains evacuation routes, field positions, staff assignments and student 
release procedures. It also contains emer
gency information on each student, emergency organization phone numbers, 
and a prioritized staff release list to ensure adequate coverage until parent notification and/or pick up can occur. One of 
the district kitchens is located on the Edwards campus, ens
uring adequate food and water for several days. The district 
received a copy of our School Safety Plan on November 22nd. Emergency drills are held monthly and the staff is trained 
several times throughout the year.   Finally, a strong partnership exists be
tween our school and local law enforcement. 
Local law enforcement agencies provide ongoing support to the school and coordinates with school and district personnel 
to ensure students safety in case of a campus or neighborhood threat.
