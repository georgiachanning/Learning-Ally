By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card 
(SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan
 
(LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For mo
re information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP
, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
princip
al or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Sisson is a fourth through eighth
-
grade school that serves approximately 320 students in the community of Mt. Shasta.  
We are a 
small, rural community with a population of about 3000 located at the base of Mt. Shasta.  Our school is in a 
wonderful area surrounded by mountains, lakes, and forests.  Sisson has a beautiful, inviting campus that is well 
maintained and serves as a commu
nity hub for school and non
-
school related activities and events.
 
 
Sisson School's primary aim is to maximize student achievement.  This school year the focus has been implementing 
restorative practices and standards
-
based grading.
 
 
Best practices in place
 
to improve student achievement are built upon a culture of collaboration.  Professional Learning 
Communities support the use of benchmark assessments and data interpretation.  A Pyramid of Intervention guides and 
supports student achievement, including st
rategic and intensive interventions for struggling learners.  Our Title I program 
serves a targeted ELA and math population, and a full time resource teacher serves learning disabled students.  
Additionally, Sisson recognizes students for hard work.  Honor
 
roll and high grade point averages are recognized in the 
local newspaper.  The school board recognizes students each month, as nominated by their teachers, for traits that 
exemplify quality work.  Our Parents In Education group supports 4.0 field trips af
ter the first, second and third quarters.
 
 
Sisson School recognizes that good attendance is a cornerstone of achievement.  A positive attendance campaign includes 
daily calls home to students who are absent and a quarterly recognition program for the stude
nt who achieves 96% 
attendance and above.  Recognition includes certificates and having their names listed in the local newspaper.  The district 
and county have Student Attendance Review Board (SARB) procedures in place to intervene for students who are no
t 
maintaining acceptable attendance.
 
 
A wide variety of opportunities for intellectual, emotional, and physical growth are provided to Sisson students.  These 
include an athletic program that includes cross country, volleyball, basketball, cheer, and track
.  The student council meets 
weekly and supports such activities as the school positive attendance campaign, movie nights, dances, and school spirit 
days.  GATE offers mini
-
courses such as ceramics, physic field trips, and coding.  Our exemplary music prog
ram features 
spring and winter concerts.  Student recognition takes the form of quarterly in
-
class assemblies for honor roll, citizenship, 
attendance, effort, athletics, and other special accomplishments. A behavior intervention plan provides structure, 
co
nsistency, and communication to support students in making good choices.  Sisson has a well
-
maintained library and 
uses the Accelerated Reader program to encourage recreational reading.
 
 
Our students and families are supported through a variety of classroo
m activities and community organizations. With our 
Positive Behavior Intervention Support (PBIS) programs, students learn to resolve conflicts among themselves, rather than 
expecting adults to intervene. The Mt. Shasta Resource Center, Siskiyou Child Care 
Council, PIE (Partners in Education), 
The Mt. Shasta Education Foundation, Boys and Girls Club, and the Mt. Shasta Recreation Department are all integral parts 
of providing a well
-
balanced education for our students.  There is before and after
-
school dayca
re available to families, 
located at Mt. Shasta Elementary School.
 
 
The Mission of the Mt. Shasta Union School District (MSUSD) is to promote a system of educational excellence providing 
the opportunity for all students to become productive citizens and ac
hieve high academic standards.

through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achieveme
nt standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Mount Shasta Union School District provides three staff development days. This year 
one staff development day was 
dedicated to grade level collaboration.  Grade levels participated in common planning of curriculum for the upcoming 
school year and development of common assessments.  The second professional development day teachers and aide
s 
traveled to Grenada to attend a county
-
wide training on restorative practices.  For the third day, held after the school year 
started, the 6th, 7th, and 8th grade teachers worked with the county office on language arts interim assessments.  Fourth 
and fi
fth teachers collaborated with the Fountas and Pinnell representative on the newly purchased book club materials.  
Each year, an outside math consultant works with our K
-
6 teachers in a job
-
embedded training model to provide model 
lessons in our classrooms
 
and lesson coaching with our teachers and students.
 
 
Newly hired teachers participate in Alliance for Teacher Excellence (ATE). This program partners each new teacher with 
an experienced teacher who serves as a mentor and coach. Participants receive ongoi
ng training for two years.
 
 
Professional Learning Communities have provided structure to regular staff collaboration as Sisson's teachers focus on:
 
1.
 
What do we want to teach?
 
2.
 
When are we going to teach it?
 
3.
 
How will we assess what we've taught?
 
4.
 
How will we respond if students do or don't understand what we've taught and assessed?
 
 
Additionally, many teachers and administrators are released from duty to attend workshops or conferences conducted 
throughout the year.
 
 
The principal attends month
ly administrative meetings at the county office.
