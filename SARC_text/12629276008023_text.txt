By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district's facilities are in good/fair repair. In 201
7
-
18, we have implemented our proposition 38 upgrades including 
new lighting inside and out, a new refrigerator and two new furnaces. The district employs 2 full time maintenance men 
who perform custodian duties and drive the bus. In the summer of 2019, we
 
made extensive repairs to a number of walls 
on the property. We do need to address our roofs which are on our maintenance to do list for the coming year.
 
In 2016
-
17, the district made a move to separate the middle school from the rest of the school in an 
effort to better 
prepare middle school students for high school. The middle school has its own courtyard, makers space and better access 
to the computer lab/specialized middle school library. The elementary has its own library in the main building run by 
v
olunteers from the Kiwanis Club! We also have music once a week and art daily. The school created and has established 
a "Sensory room" to help educate students about the mind
-
body connection and to give them the ability to use up some 
restless energy to al
low them to access their studies better! We also have created a Zen Den. This is a special place for 
students to go if they need to self
-
regulate or need a quiet break from the classroom. Run by a veteran behavior teacher, 
the Zen Den has provided assistan
ce to an average of 17 students a day. The students get a fifteen minute break in there 
on average and head back to the classroom.
 
Currently our art rotations have begun painting murals throughout the school. The work is guided by our resident artist 
and 
all students work is welcome!

All teachers at Loleta Elementary School are currently assigned to teach within their credentialed subject areas. California 
law permits elementary grade teachers to instruct in all subjects. However, in order
 
to provide our students with quality 
instruction in all areas of the curriculum, and to develop awareness of Best Practices with our current multiculturally 
diverse students our teaching staff is encouraged to actively participate in professional developm
ent classes. The teaching 
staff at Loleta Elementary School is experienced in and dedicated to their profession. Loleta Union Elementary School 
District, being a single school district, has only one teacher per 2 grade levels. The professional development 
program is 
designed for the classroom teacher to interact with other teachers in their grade level through workshops and/or 
conferences. Teachers collaborate with their collages once per month in on
-
sitel trainings. Teachers have access to high 
quality pro
fessional development through the Humboldt County Office of Education and have attended numerous 
workshops. Currently the school staff is participating in Love and Logic Trainings delivered on site. We are continuously 
reviewing MTSS and trauma informed ca
re videos on a personal basis. Our school Climate director arranges training in 
new strategies and trainings to assist our students in accessing the curriculum by learning self
-
regulation and mindfulness. 
This year we wrote a grant and participated in HCOE
's Equity Conference by providing the key
-
note speakers about how 
best to address the needs of our Native American Youth. The next grant will be focused on suicide prevention as directed 
by our Parent advisory group
-
 
the Stakeholders Committee. We also are
 
working with HCOE in determining the causes of 
Chronic absenteeism for our district to figure out more ways to support our youth. Loleta can give each child personal 
attention because it is small.
