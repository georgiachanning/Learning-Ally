About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the Smarter Balanced 
Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for En
glish language 
arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students may participate in the 
administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards 
[CCSS] for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the Universi
ty of California and 
the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs of study

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
In the 2018
-
2019 school year our parent involvement included multiple LCAP meetings to inform parents of the new LCFF funding allotments.
  
We have 
monthly Parent "Coffee Klatches" that provide parents the opportunity 
to have informal coffee meetings with the Principal as a way to provide feedback. 
The Creekside Parent Teacher Club (PTO) involves parents and staff in raising funds to support student academic achievement. 
The PTO supports many 
valued additions to the Cre
ekside curriculum, including educational field trips, supplemental reading materials, Literacy Month activities. Creekside 
parents participate in school governance through the School Site Council, the English Learner Advisory Committee, and the Dis
trict En
glish Learner 
Advisory Committee. During this school year we also held parenting classes. Creekside offered the Parenting Partners Program 
which consisted of eight 
workshops providing leadership and communication skills to parents.  In addition, we offered
 
the Positive Parenting Program which provided a ten class 
course focusing on positive relationships between parents and children.  For more information about how to get involved at yo
ur school, please contact

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students
 
and staff is a top priority at Creekside. The buildings and grounds are monitored and inspected each morning by the head cust
odian 
and the administration to note potential physical dangers. Supervisors, custodians, and administrators consistently monitor 
the school site for adults 
entering the campus. All visitors are directed to check in and out at the front office and wear a visitor badge while on camp
us. We hold monthly safety 
meetings with the yard supervisor staff to review safety procedures.
 
 
The ini
tial School Safety Plan was developed by a safety committee consisting of school administration, teachers, and classified emp
loyees and approved 
at a public meeting on January 31, 2019. The most current revision was completed in Winter 2020. We conduct fir
e, earthquake, hostile intruder, or 
evacuation safety drills monthly. Our safety committee members attended an initial training on the A.L.I.C.E protocol and has
 
begun discussing these 
procedures with our entire staff.

that focused on literacy 
with primary grade teachers. The Accelerated Math program was purchased for grades 3rd

6th.  We 
also implemented PBIS (positive behavior intervention system) as a Tier 1 School.  The Stick

us reduce bullying on campus. Library books were purchased in o
rder to provide students more access to non

hers were trained on Close
