School Description
 
Dewey Avenue Elementary School is located in
 
the city of San Gabriel within the Garvey School 
District.  It currently serves nearly 402 K
-
6th grade students in addition to housing two Head
-
start 
classes.  Dewey is a school
-
wide Title I school, serving free and reduced lunch to over 80% of the 
studen
t population.  In 2011, Dewey was proudly named a Title I Academic Achieving school.  
Beginning in the 2018/2019 school year, Dewey began to offer Dual Language+ (DL+) to incoming 
Kindergarten students. Students are primarily taught in the target language,
 
Spanish. They also 
participate in an enrichment program after school, in which they are exposed to the Mandarin 
language, arts, music, and culture.  This school year we have 4 DL+ Spanish classes, two 
Kindergarten and two first grade. Dewey educates about
 
68% Asian students, 29% Hispanic and 3% 
other, of which about 52% are English Learners.
 
 

absences by calling parents of late or absent students daily, esta
blishing SART meetings on an 
ongoing basis to encourage and improve upon attendance patterns, and when needed, submit to 
the district request for SARB meetings when all other measures to encourage attendance have 
failed.  There is minimal mobility at Dewey
, families that leave the school either move because of 
buying new homes elsewhere or move out of the state completely.  The staff continues to 

rewritten to include
 
elements of the Positive Behaviors and Interventions Support framework 
(PBIS). The purpose is to increase desired behaviors in an encouraging, leadership building 
environment.  Part of the PBIS framework is to include school
-
wide behavioral expectations. 
 
At 
Dewey, these expectations are identified in the acronym: F.L.I.P. (focus, learn, inspire, and 
persevere).
 
 
Dewey is a school
-
wide Title I school, focusing its efforts on improving effective classroom practices 
to positively impact English Language Arts
 
and Math achievement levels. Dewey provides access to 
core for its students receiving special education services.  Dewey Ave. School is able to 
accommodate students receiving related services including Resource Specialist Program from a 
qualified Resource
 
Specialist Teacher, Language and Speech services from a qualified Speech 
Pathologist, Deaf and Hard of Hearing services from a qualified provider, Adapted Physical 
Education also from a qualified service provider and DIS as well as Non
-
DIS Counseling serv
ices. 
Additionally, Dewey offers a Special Day Class (SDC), a more specialized educational program 
designed within a more restrictive classroom environment for students requiring these services as 

s (IEPs). For increased services that 
are not offered at Dewey, students would have access at the school site closest to their home school 
which provides the needed services. Dewey Avenue School students participate in a district Gifted 
and Talented educat
ional program for all identified GATE students instructed by teachers that have 
received their GATE certification.
 
 
Additionally, Dewey implements a research
-
based Response to Intervention program, for both 
academic and behavioral needs.  When a student is
 
identified as requiring additional support, the 
teachers address instructional needs for students basic or below in all core curricular areas in the 
classroom, providing small group, targeted differentiated instruction.  Teachers analyze formative 
assessm
ent data during their opportunities to collaborate in addition to informal methods of 
checking for understanding. Based upon this data, teachers identify students requiring Tier II 
targeted instruction.

Once a teacher has provided targeted instruction for a specified time
 
and has collected data indicating minimal or no growth, then the 
student may be referred for a Student Success Team Meeting (SST).  At the SST, the Instructional Coach, EL Interventionist, g
eneral 
education teacher, parent/s, administrator and if deemed n
ecessary the school psychologist meet to analyze data and identify strengths 
and needs.  The desired outcome of the SST is to develop a targeted Tier II instructional program, provided during the school
 
day, to 
develop a closely monitored academic support 
in an even smaller group setting.  This year, the school utilized iReady and Lexia Core 5, 
which is Common Core aligned with an initial assessment that provides a benchmark.  About six to eight weeks later, another a
ssessment 
is provided to determine growt
h.  At around the same time, a second SST meeting is scheduled to review data.  If needed, the child will 
be given a more rigorous type of support, increasing the intensity (from 3 times per week to daily or/and including 1:1 time 
with a fully 
credentialed
 
teacher.  About six weeks later, another assessment will be administered in addition to establishing another SST Meeting.  
Depending upon collected data, a referral for special education assessment may be suggested to parents or if deemed successfu
l, it m
ay 
be suggested the student continue with the intervention with a follow
-
up SST within another six week period.
 
 
Dewey Avenue School staff continues to place forth great effort to improve academic growth and enhance current skills to adeq
uately 
prepare stu
dents for 21st Century Learning and skills.  The EL population continues to remain a focus, as staff consistently looks at cu
rrent 
research to determine specific techniques or strategies that will close the achievement gap within the EL population and incr
ease the 
number of students qualifying for re
-
designation.  Additionally, since the Asian population has traditionally outscored the Hispanic 
population at Dewey, the Hispanic subgroup is a specific focus in honing down on how our staff can effectively con
tinue to close this 
achievement gap.  In regards to effectively preparing students for the Common Core standards and Smarter Balanced Assessments
, our 
staff is using the Depths of Knowledge chart to ask higher level comprehension questions and developing A
ligned Learning Experiences in 
the classroom.  In addition, the teachers are provided with collaborative planning time while students receive either Music, 
Art or 
Technology instruction from certificated teachers in these respective areas.
 
 
There are curre
ntly 16 certificated teachers deemed highly qualified per No Child Left Behind (NCLB) requirements at Dewey Avenue 
School.  In addition we have one highly qualified out of classroom teacher, an English Language (EL) Interventionist.  This t
eacher is 
specif
ically trained and experienced to provide instructional support in the respective areas of expertise (ELD).  The number of ye
ars 

th
 
one 
teacher also holding a Doctorate Degree.  Dewey also employs 3 highly qualified paraprofessionals per NCLB requirements.  Dew
ey has 
one administrator, the school principal, also deemed highly qualified under NCLB requirements, holding an Administrativ
e Credential and 

 
 
Dewey Avenue School allows for multiple avenues by which parents may become involved at the school site.  Dewey offers parent
 
meetings. These scheduled meetings include ELAC and SSC compliance 
topics.  In addition, Dewey provides parents with trainings provided 

earning needs. 
Dewey has fun, interactive opportunities to bui
ld a relationship with the parent community such as International Day, Lunar New Year 
Celebration, Family Picnic, Literacy Day and monthly assemblies.  This coming school year, the staff plans to offer parents w
ith trainings 
in ELA, Math, Technology and EL
D.  The Parent Teacher Association (PTA) is a fundamental group that encourages volunteers of all sorts 
and fundraising needs to support the extracurricular activities for all students.  The PTA works closely with the Home School
 
Coordinator 
to assess type
 
of teacher requested support from parents and align with parents willing to provide that support.  Every volunteer has a 
clear background check to work with our students. In addition, to providing input all our advisory council meetings, parents 
have an 
o
pportunity to openly talk with the principal at Coffee with the Principal, offered every month. High parent involvement is a 
fundamental 
goal for Dewey as educators here are committed to ensuring parents feel welcomed and part of the active learning commun
ity at Dewey.
 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a Sc
hool Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local
 
Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with da
ta reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Note: Double dashes (

ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o

Dewey Avenue School offers multiple avenues by which parents may become involved at the school site.  Dewey provides monthly 
parent meetings, 
distributing a calendar of all meeting dates for the year at Back to School Night.  
These scheduled meetings include ELAC and SSC compliance topics. 
Three times a year, data analysis sessions are provided so that parents understand how to interpret benchmark data and receiv
e the tools to effectively 
question learning needs their children 
may present  when meeting with teachers.  In addition, Dewey has fun, interactive opportunities to build a 
relationship with the parental community such as International Day, a Lunar New Year Celebration, Winter Program, Family Picn
ic Day and Literacy Day,
 
Dr. Seuss Read In and other Community focused events throughout the school year. Dewey school also invites parents three time
s per year to explore 
and to view the projects created by their students using our Code to the Future curriculum; twice a year we 
will have a Technology Showcase.  The Parent 
Teacher Association (PTA) is a fundamental group that encourages volunteers of all sorts and fundraiser to support the extrac
urricular activities for all 
students.  The PTA works closely with the Home School Coo
rdinator to assess the type of teacher requested support from parents and align with parents 
willing to provide that support.  At every meeting, an opportunity is given to the parents to provide suggestions for improvi
ng upon the opportunities 
and types of
 
parental involvement with the overall goal of ensuring parents feel welcomed and part of the active learning community at Dew
ey.
 
 
Parents, guardians, and community members are an integral part of the support system for Garvey School District students and 
have a multitude of ways 

\

attending Parent/Teacher Conferences, participating in Back
-
to
-
School Night and Ope
n House, staying informed through notices, memos, phone calls, 
newsletters are other examples of involvement.
 
 
In accordance with Title 1 regulations, our school jointly develops with parents a school
-
parent compact that outlines how parents, the entire sc
hool 
staff, and students will share the responsibility for improved student academic achievement and the means by which the school
 
and parents will build

There are ample oppo
rtunities for parents to participate in the governance of the school by joining any of the many committees such as School Sit
e 
Council, ELAC, School AdvisoryCommittee, and District Level Committees as well. The purpose of the ELAC (English Learner Advi
sory
 
Committee) is to 
advise the principal and school staff on programs and services for English learners and the School Site Council on the develo
pment of the School Plan for 
Student Achievement. Representatives from this group
 
attend monthly DAC/DELAC meetin
gs facilitated by Learning Support Services.
 
 
The SSC (School Site Council) is a team of the principal, teachers, other school personnel, parents, students, and community 
members who are elected 
that develop the mission and goals for the improvement of an 
individual school community. School Site Council evaluates the effectiveness of the school 
plan and revises it based on data collected throughout the
 
year. This group meets once a month.
 
 
In addition, parents can take advantage of the numerous parent works
hops that are provided by Learning Support Services, held at the District Parent 
Center (IPO) on topics from parenting, academic achievement, children's social emotional needs, to school
 
funding. It is always a pleasure to welcome parents/guardians to stud
ent performances, student recognition assemblies, and school functions and events. 
We appreciate your support and partnership.

The primary goal at Dewey is to ensure
 
all students have access to high quality, Tier I instruction.  Ongoing, monthly professional development sessions 
are provided to the teachers in order to provide ongoing support and training on the Common Core Standards and the ELA/ELD Fr
amework.  Profes
sional 
Development topics include: student data review,  focusing on rigor (DOK), classroom management, teaching to at
-
risk/trauma students, math practices, 
ELD framework and ELPAC.  Teachers are also reflecting on the types of questions they are asking st
udents and collaborating as grade levels to 
intentionally ask more rigorous questions using the Depths of Knowledge as a tool.  Texachers receive professional developmen
t at our weekly 
professional development meetings and weekly PLC meetings provided by t
he specialized TOSAs, the principal, and the EL Interventionist.  Teachers are 
provided collaboration time on two Tuesdays per month and every Wednesday to synthesize the information and cognitively plan 
to incorporate this 
new knowledge into their daily p
ractice.
 
 
Every week grade level teachers, specialized TOSAs, EL Interventionist, and Principal work in collaborative planning teams to
 
critically examine and 
discuss; standards
-
based learning, expectations, best practices, strategies, and develop units/le
sson plans.  These Professional Learning Communities 
consist of a team cycle: study, focus, plan, implement, analyze, and adjust. Our PLC place emphasis on both student and adult
 
learning while building a 
culture of collaboration while maintaining a consta
nt focus on results.  In addition, the principal engages in consistent observations of classroom practice 
and provides teachers with timely feedback.  Follow up professional development topics may be modified to address school
-
wide needs of previously 
pres
ented instructional information.
 
 
In addition to the Professional Development provided at Dewey, our teachers receive professional development provided by Garv
ey School District. As a 
Computer Science school, our teacher receives computer science training 
in the form of 1/2 day sessions and bi
-
weekly coaching support, provided by a 
Computer Science TOSA.
