By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Smith School continually strives to improve our educational programs and facilities. Smith underwent a major renovation 
project, which was completed in the sprin
g of 2005. A state
-
of
-
the
-
art learning environment was created with student 
learning as a focal point, and includes 30 classrooms, two science labs, a library, media center, office, and new playground.
 
Classrooms are equipped with wiring, equipment, and ot
her features of a modern
-
day educational facility. The majority 
of the site is seven years old. The multipurpose room, science building, and kindergarten building, which are more than 
36 years old, were also remodeled.
 
 
During the 2013
-
14 school year, our 
district placed a fence around the school. Visitors and volunteers must check in 
through the office.
 
 
Education is a top priority in the community of Livermore, and maintaining a safe and orderly environment maximizes 
student learning. The citizens of Live
rmore have passed three major funding measures targeting school facility needs: 
Measure B in 1975, Measure L in 1999 and, most recently in June 2016, the generous and supportive Livermore community 
passed the Measure J Facilities Bond.
 
 
Measure J funds wil
l be used to:
 

 
Modernize classrooms, science labs, and educational technology for 21st
-
century instruction
 

 
Repair aging infrastructure: roofs, plumbing, HVAC and electrical systems
 

 
Renovate facilities for advanced science, technology, engineering and math 
(STEM) and Career Technical
 
 
Education (CTE) courses
 

 
Improve safety, including security lighting, fencing, fire safety, and other emergency systems
 

 
Upgrade deteriorated hardscapes, physical education facilities, and pick
-
up/drop
-
off zones
 

 
Increase access t
o school facilities to better accommodate individuals with disabilities
 
Through these bond measures and developer fees, the LVJUSD has been able to renovate, modernize and construct new 
schools following the Facilities Master Plan.

Facilities are maintain
ed through the diligent efforts of the site custodial crews and the district maintenance staff. The 
LVJUSD Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the LVJUSD. The principal works with the 
custodial staff to develop cleaning sch
edules to maintain clean and safe schools. District maintenance staff performs the 
repairs necessary to keep schools in good working order in a timely manner. A work
-
order process is used to ensure 
efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the
 
highest priority.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Sum
mative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

ber of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they
 
received a score or not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

sustained parent involvement in the education of their children contributes greatly to student achievement and a positive 
school environment. The Superintendent or designee shall work with staff and paren
ts/guardians to develop meaningful 
opportunities at all grade levels for parents/guardians to be involved in district and school activities; advisory, decision
-

 
 
Educational research s
uggests that highly effective schools have a number of features in common, including high levels of 

high levels and have more well
-
rounded
 
educational experiences. LVJUSD parents are welcome partners in our school 
community. There is a range of opportunities for parents to engage with schools, including Parent
-
Teacher Associations 
(PTAs), Parent Faculty Associations (PFAs), sports and activi
ty booster clubs, and other supporter groups. On a monthly 

Communication and Information Council (PCIC). This gathering provides an opportun
ity for parent groups to collaborate 
with each other and representatives of the district regarding events, opportunities, and activities for students and families
. 
This is also a time district representatives share new initiatives and current information w
ith parent leaders. In addition, 
parents have the opportunity to share general concerns and ask questions directly to the superintendent. Each school also 
has formal advisory groups including School Site Councils (SSCs) and English Learner Advisory Committ
ees (ELACs) who 
represent other parents at the site and are critical in the development and monitoring of the 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement (SPSA). A representative from each SSC serves on the district Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) 
Advisor
y Committee and a member of each ELAC serves on the District English Learner Advisory Council (DELAC), which 
also serves as the LCAP English Learner Advisory Committee. Through these two
-
way systems of parent support and 
engagement, parents, district, and 
school staff have open lines of communication and opportunities to engage in 
meaningful ways with the school community.
 
 
There is a strong, supportive link between Emma C. Smith Elementary School and the parent community. Parents are an 
integral part of su
pport through Autumn Treasures, a Parent Teacher Association (PTA) fund
-
raiser that raises funds for 
various school programs, assemblies, classroom resources, field trips, technology, and school events. We are fortunate to 
have dedicated parents who volunt
eer their time and support for our many programs. By participating in the PTA, School 
Site Council (SSC), English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), or volunteering throughout the school, there are many

schoolwide rules provide safety for all and emphasize positive behavior and problem
-
solving in a peaceful and cooperative 
manner. We work closely with the school community to provide children with a supportive
, caring environment that

The school safety plan was reviewed and updated by our safety committee with a final review
 
at our August 2019 staff 
meeting. Emma Smith's safety team has met this school year (10/9/19) to update the plan and conclude that our school 
is a safe place for students and staff.  The school site council along with the school safety team are diligently
 
working to 
find areas that need remediation and ways that we can include social
-
emotional learning in our practice.
 
 
Our campus is secured with closed and locked gates during school hours, requiring all visitors to check
-
in at the office 
through our compu
terized badge system. In the event of an evacuation, procedures are in place to allow a quick visual to 
account for all students and staff. Fire, earthquake and lockdown drills are practiced regularly on a district schedule. Usin
g 
Blackboard, we can quickl
y call several phone numbers and email simultaneously to alert parents in case of an emergency.

Our district recognizes that each employee

classified, certificated and management

influences the opportunities for 
students to achieve
 
at the highest levels. In line with our District Professional Development Plan, we offer and support 
ongoing growth opportunities that allow every teacher, administrator, and staff member to further develop the 
appropriate knowledge, skills, and practices
 
required to create learning environments that allow all students to 
demonstrate high levels of achievement. Our Board of Education and our district administration recognize that all staff 
members of the LVJUSD must be provided time and support to acquire,
 
improve, and enhance professional knowledge, 
practices, and skills.
 
 
During the 2019
-
2020 school year, relevant and timely professional development will be available and delivered to 
employees. In addition, two designated professional development days and
 
the flexible professional development day for 
certificated staff provide the option of individualized professional growth for teachers. Professional development will 
primarily focus on effective tier one instruction; Positive Behavior Interventions and Su
pports (PBIS), student and staff 
safety; customer service; meeting the needs of students with Individual Education Plans (IEP); effective usage of 
technology as an instructional tool; effective instructional practices for English learners; and implementati
on of specialized 
programs such as Dual Immersion, Project Lead the Way, International Baccalaureate, and Advanced Placement programs.
