School Description
 
 
Principal's Message
 
Nestled in a peaceful Los Angeles suburb, Lakeview Elementary, home of 
the Lions, is the pride of 
its neighborhood.  Located at 11500 Joslin Street in the City of Santa Fe Springs, the facility is 
comprised of thirty
-
four classrooms, a multi
-
purpose room, and a library.  Lakeview Elementary has 
had a recent infusion of techno
logy with a Chromebook cart in every 1
-
5th grade classroom, and 
one shared cart in Kindergarten.  With over 525 students in grades TK
-
5, the school sits at the hub 
of a tightly knit community where school staff, parents, and community leaders work hand in 
hand 
to provide a safe, nurturing, learning environment.
 
 
Recognized as a former California Distinguished School by the California Department of Education, 
a California Business for Education Excellence Honor Roll School (2015, 2016, 2017), and a 
California 
Gold Ribbon School (2016), Lakeview focuses on high academic achievement for all students.  
Teachers provide purposeful and strategic instruction using the California State Standards and 
district pacing guides.  There is a shared commitment to c
onsistently implement best practices and 
research
-
based strategies.  As a Professional Learning Community, teachers work in collaborative 
teams to analyze data, modify instruction, and provide intervention as needed to ensure student 
success.  Students at 
Lakeview Elementary are motivated and encouraged to think critically, 
communicate effectively, and be active participants in successfully achieving their academic and 
personal growth goals to become lifelong learners.
 
 
At Lakeview, we foster a partnership 
of school, home, and community through ongoing 
communication and community events.   Our supportive Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) works 
closely with the school to provide funds and programs which enrich the school experience for our 
students.  To furth
er extend their academic programs, students participate in programs such as 
Meet the Masters, as well as classes in art, music, and physical education.
 
 
Our most recent LLCSD parent survey stated that 100% of Lakeview parents were satisfied with 
their chil
d's school.  The community of Lakeview Elementary is dedicated to creating a learning 
environment that supports high expectations for student achievement and behavior.  We believe 
that all students can achieve at high levels.  Our passion for successful st
udent achievement and 
our focus on collaboration, community ownership, and pride are elements that define Lakeview 
Elementary School and make it an outstanding place for all.

About the SARC
 
By Febru
ary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fundi
ng Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state a
nd local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the sch
ool, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our main building is 58 years old and in good condition. In 1997, 2000, and 2002, additions were constructed, making our 
campus adequate for our 
population. In 2008

2009, we updated the bell and alarm system throughout the entire campus. Exterior lighting, as well as wireless internet was 
added 
this year throughout campus.
 
 
Our two custodians clean each classroom every other
 
day and the restrooms every day. District maintenance maintains landscaping on an every
-
other
-
week basis.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the
 
Williams legislation o
f 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical sys
tems, heating and ventilation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings 
and grounds are safe and in good repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for
 
this assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Constructio
n (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the six
-
page Facilities Inspection 
Tool used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

-
20)
 
Lakeview Elementary School offers a variety of parent involvement opportunities.  Parents regularly support the educational p
rogram at Lakeview by 
being present at parent conferences and attending Back to School and Open House
 
events.  Parents are invited to assist their child's teacher by 
volunteering in the classroom and chaperoning grade
-
level field trips.
 
 
Parents are encouraged to attend our parent education events throughout the school year.  The events are supported thro
ugh the LCAP Supplemental 
and Concentration Funds with money specified for parent involvement.  Lakeview currently hosts a parent computer class in our
 
lab after school.  Parent 
education nights in literacy and math are held as well as STEAM night, and Fam
ily Art Night
 
 
Lakeview has a very active PTO that sponsors many activities throughout the year for students and parents.  Our PTO organizes
 
and sponsors events such 
as the Welcome Back Ice Cream Social, Fall Festival, Red Ribbon Week, Staff Appreciation W
eek, Moms and Muffins, Founder's Day, Dads and Donuts, 
and Grade Level Field Trip Transportation.  New members and volunteers are always welcome.
 
 
All members of the Lakeview School community share in the decision
-
making process by electing parents as memb
ers of the School Site Council (SSC) or 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC).  Elected members provide leadership and help implement the vision for the school c
ommunity through the 
creation, adoption, and implementation of the School Plan.
 
 
At Lakevie
w, our staff recognizes and values the importance of working collaboratively with our parents as they are an integral part of
 
our team.  
According to our latest parent survey, 100% of surveyed parents feel they are adequately informed about their child's p
rogress and have good 
communication with the school.  In addition, 99% of parents are pleased with the progress their child is making.

Safety Plan that is updated annually.  The last update to the plan was in June 2019 with contents shared with 
staff members in August 2019.  The School Safety Plan contains the procedures and plans for ingress/egress, student safety, n
atural disasters, fir
es, 
lockdowns, as well as plans for evacuation.
 
 
Lakeview is a closed campus with all exterior gates locked throughout the school day.  There are two points of entry in the m
orning, one door at the 
cafeteria and one gate closest to the office, that are mon
itored by supervision staff.  Only students are allowed to enter campus through the monitored 
gate between 8:05 a.m. and 8:17 a.m. and the cafeteria between 7:30 a.m. and 8:05 a.m.  All visitors, including parents and v
olunteers, must sign in at 
the office
.  Upon dismissal, the gate closest to the front office is opened by a supervisor and all students exit with their teacher an
d are released to a 
parent or guardian.
 
 
At Lakeview, various emergency drills are held throughout the year, with all staff 
participating in the Great California Shake
-
out in October.
 
 
Lakeview is currently in our fifth year of PBIS implementation.  We are addressing Tier 1 universal supports through teaching
 
appropriate behavior via a 
school
-
wide matrix.  Behaviors are reinfor
ced through a positive incentive program. We are currently addressing Tier II supports through the 
establishment of a check
-
in/check
-
out system for students in need of additional supports. To assist Lakeview's teachers and staff in providing a safe, 
nurtur
ing, learning environment, we have also adopted the "No Bully" program.  If any staff member witnesses an act of bullying, he
 
or she shall take 
immediate steps to intervene and redirect students.  In addition, students are encouraged to report any acts of 
bullying they witness or receive. If a 
Solution Team is appropriate, the Solution Coach will meet with the target of bullying and offer to convene a Solution Team t
o bring the bullying to an 
end.   According to our latest parent survey, 99% of parents felt
 
that Lakeview's school
-
wide discipline policy is effective.
 
 
Students' social and emotional well being is addressed through a variety of services.  Students have immediate access to our 
school counselor and school 
psychologist.  In addition, we have a cou
nseling intern provided by Turning Point Counseling Services on campus every Wednesday. Referrals are also 
made on an as need basis to local agencies such as Pacific Clinics, The Whole Child, and the City of Santa Fe Springs Family 
and Youth Intervention 
P
rogram.
 
 
Additionally, LCAP Supplemental and Concentration Funds are used for student motivational activities to increase student conn
ectedness to school.

Types of Services Funded
 
The Little Lake City School District provides additional services for students using federal funds (Title I, Title III, Title
 
IV) and LCAP funds.  Title I funds are 
primarily used to support all students using a Response to Intervention (RtI) model.  At th
e elementary sites, Interventionists are funded to provide 
differentiated instruction to meet the needs of all learners within the RtI model in ELA and mathematics during the school da
y.  At the middle schools, 
Interventionists monitor student academic pro
gress and determine placement for intervention based on student needs.  Title I funds are also used to 
support parent involvement at both the site and district level.  Title III is used to provide supplemental services to all En
glish Learners including add
itional 
tutoring beyond the school day, and professional development for EL Coordinators.  Title IV funds provide students with a wel
l
-
rounded education and 
supports using phenomena in NGSS
-
designed lessons through the creation of NGSS kits.  In addition, 
these funds support safe and healthy students 
through the implementation of a social emotional learning program, Second Step, which is a proactive approach to building ess
ential social and behavioral 
skills.  LCAP Funds are used to supplement services for 
English learners, low income students, and homeless/foster students.  Some actions and services 
include additional counselors, professional development for teachers, supplemental materials, parent engagement opportunities
, and student 
motivation activities
.
