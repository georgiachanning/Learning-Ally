Oak Avenue Elementary School
 1 2018-19 School Accountability Report Card
PRINCIPAL™S MESSAGEWelcome to Oak Avenue School™s Annual Accountability Report Card. This report will 
provide valuable information about our school™s instructional focus, academic 
achievements, classroom materials, safety measures, quality of instruction, and parent involvement opportunities. All staff at Oak Avenue School believe that a nurturing and supportive environment is key to meeting the 

incentives for our students that includes assemblies to allow staff to recognize students for excellent 
attendance, outstanding achievement, and good citizenship.  Oak Avenue promotes a positive school 
culture and holds quarterly assemblies to promote citizenship and anti-bullying behavior.
Oak Avenue School is focused on providing a comprehensive and viable curriculum to increase student 
achievement. Teachers are committed to providing students with high levels of learning. 
In addition, all of our instruction is planned around the Common Core State Standards.  Our goal is to 
prepare our students to become the leaders of tomorrow. 
Instructional staff use a variety of research-based strategies to accommodate individual learning styles 
and maintain high, yet obtainable, expectations for students. Oak Avenue School looks forward to 
establishing a partnership with its parents and community to support each child™s journey to achieving 
academic success. In accordance with Proposition 98, every school in California is required to issue an annual School Accountability Report Card. However, we view this as not only a means of complying with state legislature, 
but as an opportunity to keep our community well informed. We desire to keep the lines of communication 
open and welcome any suggestions, comments, or questions you may have. It is the opinion of the district, myself in particular, that a well-informed public is vital in continuing to advance in an ever-evolving 
world.Sonia Aramburo, Principal
