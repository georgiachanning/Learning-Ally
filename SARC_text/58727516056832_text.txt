Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school has been a three
-
time Title I Academic Achievement Award winn
er, a California Distinguished School and a 
four time California Honor Roll school. Our staff believes that our assessment scores and student progress are a due to 
collaboration with effective instructional strategies, program planning and sequencing in bo
th language arts and math, 
Response to Intervention (RTI) academic programs, and our social/school skills supports in place for students. As a district,
 
we adopt curriculum that is state adopted and standards
-
based.  Computer
-
based programs are used to sup
plement 
curriculum.  We hold student Renaissance rallies and recess activities to recognize student achievement with academics, 
attendance, and behavior elements that, together, help us to encourage and support the growth and success of the whole 
child.
 
 
L
one Tree welcomes parents and community volunteers on our campus. It is our goal to team with families to create the 
best educational environment possible for our students.
 
 
All four of Wheatland School District schools offer an ASES after school program. 

Academics, Recreation and Enrichment) Programs start on the first day of school and end on the last day of school, open 
Monday through Friday from the end of the school day until 6:00 PM. C.A.R.E. is open on minimum days
 
at the early 
dismissal time and is closed on school holidays. After School C.A.R.E. offers cycles of intervention academic and 
enrichment (e.g. theme
-
based arts and crafts, STEM, and physical education activities) components. Students enrolled in 
the dist
rict and who are entering grades Transitional Kindergarten through 8 in the fall are eligible to participate. 
Furthermore, the After School Program sponsors a highly recognized Camp program (a full day program of at least 6 hrs), 
offering a summer activity
 
option for district children.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Lone Tree School was built in 1948. In 2002, all roofs and 
heating, ventilating, and air
-
conditioning systems were replaced. 
In 2007, all electrical transformers were replaced and major electrical work was conducted under critical hardship funds. 
Projects for 2010

2011 included a parking lot renovation, further pl
ayground updates, replacement of all outdoor water 
fountains, installation of campus cabling for technology, overhaul of classroom electrical supply and sources, and a kitchen 
upgrade with flooring and equipment. New energy efficient lighting was added in 
2014 to the entire campus to continue 
our progress towards an environmentally friendly campus. Lone Tree has a unique cafeteria mural which depicts the 
aircraft assigned to Beale Air Force Base.  In 2016, we added an entry way mural for those coming into o
ur driveway to 
further enhance our connectivity with our base location.  In 2017, we began updating restroom lighting and restroom 
faucets.  We also began a phased painting of the campus exterior.  In 2018 we installed filtered water bottle filler stations
 
in four locations on campus, continued exterior painting and continued mural painting on exterior building walls.  In 2019, 
we added another student art mural, updated the phone system district wide and updated audible horn systems for 
exterior campus not
ifications.   We aim for our school to be clean, safe, and functional within the available resources. Our 
site has established cleaning standards. A summary of these standards is available through the site administrator. We give 
food service and restroom f
acilities the highest priority on a daily basis to ensure the health and safety of students and 
staff.

through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in t
he administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have
 
successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our classrooms are open 15 minutes before school begins. We have a supervised, district complimentary breakfast 
program.  Staff members 
monitor the parking lot immediately after dismissal. We have a closed campus, and all visitors 
must register with the office. We hold monthly fire/earthquake drills monthly and a minimum of three safety lockdown 
practices annually. Our safety plan is updat
ed annually and we have worked with Rapid Responder, a county services 
program, and a military base liaison to coordinate the plan with outside agencies. All administrators completed a disaster 
safety course with DPREP in the past and conduct annual staff 
training at the site. The site administrator attended ALICE 
training.  We continue to work with Beale Air Force Base to practice and revise elements within our safety plan.

Lone Tree School and Wheatland 
School District are dedicated to the educational development of teachers and staff. 
Seven staff development minimum days are scheduled yearly, designed to enhance the educational experience of our 
students. Through after school workshops, staff evaluates s
tudent data to develop a continuing educational plan to meet 
the needs of the constantly changing student population. Teachers tackle the areas of Common Core curriculum, school 
safety, state testing demands, technology updates and implementation, and look
 
at social
-
emotional student needs to 
develop a program that looks to educate the whole student.
 
 
In addition to these on campus opportunities, staff attends best practice conferences ranging in topics from Common 
Core, classroom behavior support, student 
support services, special education law, military student support classes, as 
well as county developed trainings. The Lone Tree team works hard to not only collaborate with campus staff, but with 
the surrounding communities to develop a top notch program.
 
 
Teachers are supported throughout the implementation process through a combination of peer led trainings, trainings 
and meetings, as well as administrative observations. Data is evaluated often to ensure the continued growth of our 
programs and provide op
portunities to address student needs through our continued professional development.
