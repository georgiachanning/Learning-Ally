By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

 
Dayton Elementary School is located in the Washington Manor area of San Leandro. Although 
within the city limits of San 
Leandro, Dayton is part of the San Lorenzo Unified School District. In September 1998, Dayton re
-
opened as a K

5 
elementary school. Students who attend Dayton primarily are from single
-
family homes in the area. A number of 
apa
rtment complexes also claim Dayton as their home school.
 
 
The students enrolled at Dayton reflect many cultures and represent a wide ethnic diversity. This diverse population is 
serviced by a well
-
qualified group of teachers and other educational specialis
ts.  The Dayton School staff continues to be 
committed to providing a well
-
balanced educational program that promotes a high level of academic achievement while 

-
worth.  Using Responsive Classroom and 
Restorative Justice 
practices, the Dayton community continually supports students' social
-
emotional needs.
 
 
Students receive a strong foundation in English/Language Arts and Mathematics.  They also receive instruction in Science, 
History/Social Studies, 
Physical Education, Music, Art, and Technology.  For the past several years, Dayton Staff has been 
actively involved in professional development opportunities to strengthen our understanding of the Common Core State 
Standards (CCSS) and how to best improve
 
our instructional practices to meet 21st
-
century learning needs and prepare 
students for college and career readiness.  In addition to analyzing the CCSS and planning lessons that align with these 
standards, the staff reviews multiple assessment systems i
ncluding F&P Reading Assessment Benchmarks, NWEA, and 
CAASPP and adjusting current practices to best support students to ensure success on the new assessments.
 
 
The school provides many enrichment activities, such as assemblies and field trips that build s
elf
-
esteem and enable 
students to become good decision
-
makers and responsible citizens.  Throughout the school year, Dayton teachers plan 
activities that focus on cultural awareness and appropriate behavior.  These activities are organized in order to help
 
students gain an understanding and appreciation of the rich community and personal heritage that students bring to the 
school campus.  To better understand us, we invite you to visit classes and attend school
-
sponsored events including 
Wednesday Morning G
atherings, School Site Council (SSC), English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), Back

Dayton Elementary Mission Statement:
 
All Dayton students are valued and appreciated for
 
their unique talents and backgrounds. Dayton School challenges our 
students to become independent thinkers, responsible citizens, and lifelong learners, by providing an interactive and 
mutually respectful learning environment. The Dayton staff works towar
d bettering our understanding of how our 
behaviors and practices are linked to our expectations of student achievement. We acknowledge that having 
conversations about equity and the achievement gap are uncomfortable, yet through these discussions, we furth
er build 
our skills and strategies in teaching all students within our diverse student body. We understand that moments of 
discomfort may also be moments for great learning. We use multiple data sets to create new tools and improve old ones, 
while continua
lly remaining flexible. Dayton School remains focused on our students and the community we serve.

Equity Mission
 
Equity in the San Lorenzo Unified School district is acknowledging historical biases and changing the way they are 
addressed in terms of 
closing the achievement and opportunity gap. We define our approach to the work of equity as 
providing for each student the academic, emotional and social supports needed to increase the achievement of 
underserved subgroups at an accelerated rate while add
itionally increasing overall student performance.
 
 
District Mission Statement
 
The San Lorenzo Unified School District teachers and staff will collaborate with families and the community to cultivate 
safe learning environments and ensure equitable opportuni
ties and outcomes for all students.  All students will become 
engaged community members contributing to, and becoming good stewards of our changing world.  All students will reach 
their highest potential as creative and critical thinkers prepared for colle
ge, career and lifelong learning.
 
 
District Vision
 
Students will become creative, collaborative, compassionate, resilient, well
-
informed and socially responsible advocates 
for equity and social justice as a result of their education, experience, and suppor
t from educators, families and the 
community.

Elementary School has been allocated 75 hours of custodial time per week and the services of a District 
maintenance crew ensure that the school and grounds are clean and well maintained.
 
 
Our school has guidelines for managing emergencies such as earthquak
es and fires. Staff supervisors monitor students 
while on the playground during recesses or other assigned outdoor activities.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California
 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [
ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State St
andards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univer
sity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

he number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level 
percentages are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our Dayton School Safety Plan was developed with input from both parents and staff.  Each year, the Dayton Safety Team 
and the Dayton SSC review and approve an 
updated version of the plan. Periodically throughout the year, we reinforce 
with the staff, both in training and in written form, each of their responsibilities in the event of an emergency. All staff 
members have a safety handbook that details their respo
nsibilities as well as descriptions of each of those tasks. In the 
event of an emergency, all members have assigned responsibilities.
 
 
All school staff members are expected to wear identification badges. All visitors are required to sign in at the office a
nd 
obtain a visitor sticker, which they must wear while on campus.
 
 
We work with the City of San Leandro and the County of Alameda, who perform safety checks to ensure that the school 
facilities meet fire and structural safety standards. Each classroom has
 
an outside telephone line with voicemail. Classified 
and/or certificated employees supervise the activities of the students before school, during recess, lunch, and at dismissal.
 
Dayton School continuously reviews the School Safety Plan and conducts month
ly safety drills.
 
 
The School Safety Plan was most recently reviewed, updated, and discussed with school faculty in October 2019.

In addition to ongoing site

based professional development, including twice
-
monthly Staff Professional Development 
Meetings which focus upon teaching strategies, curriculum development, and equity work, all teachers
 
have the 

-
services or 
other workshops offered by the County Office of Education or other organizations. Teachers have opportunities to attend
 
professional conferences supported by site or District funding.  Staff members also take advantage of release time to 
observe colleagues teaching and debrief best practices.
 
 
Dayton Staff is currently focusing our Professional Development sessions on the 
Common Core State Standard, the new 
literacy curriculum Fountas and Pinnell Classroom, Balanced Literacy (including Guided Reading and Fountas & Pinnell 
running record assessments), better supporting our English Language Learners with both designated and i
ntegrated 
language strategies, using Evidence
-
Based Practices in our instruction, and implementing Restorative Practices throughout 
the school.
 
 
Since the integration of technology is important to student success, teachers also have access to technology in
tegration 

regularly offers professional development on how to integrate technology to support standards and learning as well as 
profes
sional collaboration.
 
 
Professional Development for New Teachers:
 
Through participation in the East Bay Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) Induction Program, the District 
secures support providers to work with new teachers. Through this BTSA I
nduction Program, new teachers are also 
afforded the opportunity to take university
-
level courses at a reduced tuition cost. This program offers training to new 
teachers for two years, as they sharpen their skills as educators. The induction portion of thi
s program leads them to 
acquire their clear credential through the Commission on Teacher Credentialing.
