School Description
 
School Description 
 
 
Sierra Elementary School is one of sixteen schools in the Rocklin Unified School District. Sierra is 
the only elementary school in the district offering the International Baccalaureate Primary Years 
Programme, and is one of only three 
authorized IB/PYP schools in Northern California. Sierra 
Elementary serves students in kindergarten through sixth grade, with an enrollment of 
approximately 500. The school is located in the center of a dynamic and supportive community 
which expresses its 
values toward education through a high level of participation. Sierra Elementary 
School opened in 2001.
 
 
The staff of Sierra Elementary School provides an exemplary learning environment. Academic 
learning through the IB instructional philosophy of 
inquiry
-
based learning is the focus of the school. 
Commendably, the staff operates on the principle that a caring environment which fosters self
-
worth and individual development is the best road toward realizing such learning. The students are 
able to appr
oach all facets of their learning with confidence and the assurance that this school is 
their home. The IB Learner Profile characteristics for behavior and learning are realized internally, 
leading to self
-
directedness and initiative. Finally, the staff we
lcomes the direct involvement of the 
community in these efforts. At Sierra Elementary School, parents and staff together are dedicated 
to creating a safe and orderly learning environment in which students interact positively with 
others and are able to dev
elop responsibility, confidence, and self
-
worth while achieving their 
highest academic potential grounded in skills for success in the 21st century.
 
 
Parents play an important role in Sierra Elementary School through active participation and 
involvement in School Site Council and PTC. They share information with classes about professional 
lives, teach special skills, work on school and playground improv
ements, conduct fundraisers, and 
make donations. Over 200 parents and community members regularly volunteer their services in 
our classrooms. Sierra Elementary School has become a focal point and center for students and the 
community.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
 
T
he highest aspiration of Sierra Elementary, an International Baccalaureate World School, is to 
ensure that all young people are inspired to become confident, life
-
long learners who thrive 
intellectually and are globally
-
minded, compassionate, and balanced.
 
Sierra is distinguished by: 
 

 
Academic rigor through guided inquiry instruction,
 

 
Relevant and diverse learning opportunities, and
 

 
A nurturing and supportive environment in collaboration with parents and community.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Californ
ia is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agen
cies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data repo
rted in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta
/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members
 
should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Sierra Elementary School is a beautiful facility built in 2001. It is aesthetically pleasing as well as being an excellent en
vir
onment for student learning. It 
is a school of which students, staff, and parents can be proud.
 
 
Sierra has a comprehensive safety and crisis intervention plan. District wide safety inspections are done on an ongoing basis
 
throughout the year.  The 
school 
grounds are closely monitored by staff before and after school as well as the school day. The Rocklin Unified School District
 
policy for registration 
of visitors is strictly adhered to with all visitors signing in before they are allowed to visit the campu
s.  Members of our community use our facilities every 
afternoon and evening.
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.  To assist in this effort, the d
istrict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed b
y the State of California Office of Public School Construction.  District maintenance ensures that the repairs necessary to k
eep the school 
sites in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure eff
icient service and that emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority.

glish language 
arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students may participate in the 
administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards 
[CCSS] for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities);
