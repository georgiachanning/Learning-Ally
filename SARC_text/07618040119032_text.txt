About the 
SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the 
Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities
 
to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

For additional inform
ation about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or the district office.

The San Ramon Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a comprehensive, inclusive model of professional development 
for all staff. Our high 
quality professional 
development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy and instructional strategie
s. 
In 2012
-
13, we established district
-
wide K
-
12 Task Forces in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along w
ith targeted professional 
development offerings. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and t
he Silicon Valley Math 
Initiative. Both organizations are highly respected and have strong ties to the de
velopment and implementation of the CCSS and professional learning 
offerings.
 
 
These learning experiences are supported with on
-
site coaching provided by a team of instructional coaches who work and train together. The coaches 
received certification as Comm
on Core trainers through the Leadership and Learning Center. They provide one
-
to
-
one coaching, team and grade level 
coaching, whole school professional development, in addition to targeted cross
-
grade level, cross
-
discipline professional development sessio
ns. These 
trainings connect to every aspect of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
formative assessment for 
learning, and lesson design.
 
 
In addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to pa
rticipate in a coach
-
led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting. 
These cohorts are both semester
-
long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for 
Innovators to Proble
m Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously.
 
 
We ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project (formerly known as BTSA). Our s
ummer intensive 
trainings along with on
-
going staff deve
lopment days and release day trainings deeply align with the needs of our individual schools and our Framework 
for Excellence: Supporting Students and their Learning; Supporting Staff and their Work.

Under the leadership and guidance of site administrators
, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to deepen their content 
knowledge, strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of respo
nsibility. As a result, every 
staff member
 
helps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the district as a whole is enhan
ced.
