By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-

School Profiles
 
Gravenstein Union School District is
 
a Transitional Kindergarten through 8th
-
grade school district with an enrollment of 
approximately 750 students, most of whom come from English speaking homes with a variety of socio
-
economic 
backgrounds. The district is located in the western rural sectio
n of Sebastopol in Western Sonoma County. The District 
serves a primarily rural population in an area of limited growth. Approximately ninety
-
four percent of the property located 

oma County General Plan. This zoning 
classification also affects the number of students living within the district.
 
 
There are four schools in the district. Gravenstein Elementary School is a TK
-
5 charter school with the exception of some 
first
-
grade class
es (called Gravenstein First School). Hillcrest Middle School is a 6th 
-
 
8th
-
grade middle school which is a 
charter school, and the district also has a Community Day School. The District is a TK
-
8 Magnet Program due to the ENRICH! 
program.
 
 
The sites refle
ct the rural nature of the community. The relatively low teacher: student ratio at each site, excellent staff, 
and very involved parents have worked together to establish a student body that has achieved some of the highest 
standardized test scores in Sono
ma County for the last 15 years.
 
 
All classes TK
-
5 are self
-
contained. Primary classes (TK
-
3) have an approximate ratio of 20
-
1 and middle grades average an 
approximate ratio of 25
-
1. Instructional support assistants, paid by categorical monies, are utiliz
ed in Grades TK
-
8 
according to need in the classroom. Instructional assistants work in conjunction with the Special Education Teachers to 
instruct in Learning Labs at both campuses. The Learning Labs are operated through combining categorical funding to 
se
rve students who need intervention or tutoring. Students are provided service according to their need 

 
regardless of 
whether they qualify for special education or not. This setting provides additional services in the areas of 
Reading/Language Arts and Mat
h to identified and/or below
-
grade
-
level students. Other services available to Gravenstein 
Union School District students (on both campuses) include the Speech and Language Program, an academic counselor, 
and a school psychologist. The same services are av
ailable at the middle school campus.
 
 
Students in grades TK through 3 receive music instruction one day per week and students in grades 4 and 5 receive music 
instruction twice a week. Visual art is also part of the Gravenstein School program and all studen
ts receive weekly art 
instruction.  Hillcrest Middle School has a variety of scheduled music, art and drama programs. All grade levels participate 
in regular field trips and enrichment classes.
 
 
The school district utilizes a social
-
emotional learning prog
ram (SEL) entitled Second Step.  Empathy, Emotion 
Management, Impulse Control, Problem Solving, and Anger Management are some of the topics covered.
 
 
Thank you for your interest in our schools.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
This 
school has 28 classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library, and an administration building 
-
 
which includes the district 
office. With two campuses, the district employs three full
-
time custodial and maintenance professionals. The district works 
proactively t
o provide safe, clean, and adequate facilities. Deferred Maintenance projects are continually planned and 
executed (such as replacement of student restroom stalls, toilets, and tile as needed on both campuses.
 
 
Classroom carpet replacement, painting, blackt
op and striping of parking lots are just a few of the other ongoing projects.
 
 
We have had a modernization or new building project (to remove and replace old modular units) at one of the campuses 
every summer for the last several years. In 2012, the distri
ct passed a General Obligation Bond for a new building project 
for Hillcrest Middle School campus and modernization project at Gravenstein Elementary.  The Gravenstein Elementary 
School modernization project is in process. Phase 1, which was completed in A
ugust of 2015, included new roofing, 
sidewalks, and ADA compliance construction. Phase 2 of the modernization began in June of 2016. This part of the 
modernization includes a complete renovation of the student restrooms, heating and lighting in most classr
ooms, and 
changes to the district and school offices. Phase 2 was completed at the start of the 2017
-
18 year. Phase 3 began in the 
summer of 2018 and included remodeling the multi
-
purpose room, staff bathrooms, and learning lab classroom with new 
flooring,
 
lighting, and heating system.
 
 
Gravenstein has finished Phase 3 which included renovation of the Gravenstein MPR including new roofing, flooring, fully 
remodeled kitchen, windows, and painting interior and exterior.  Prop 39 improvements which occurred du
ring the school 
year include completing the upgrading of lighting to LED throughout the campus.  Additionally, kindergarten classrooms 
received new carpeting during the summer of 2019.  New window coverings were also installed for safety.  Solar for the 
ca
mpus has been substantially completed for the campus to begin using solar power.  Routine maintenance items were 
performed for items that needed attention or repair.

The Trustees and the Superintendent attended county office workshops regarding LCFF and LCAP. Input on the LCAP was 
solicited via Monday Messages to the S
uperintendent and a series of meetings. It was decided to include individual 
responses to questions to include people who could not attend meetings.  Parent, staff, Board, student, and administrative 
LCAP meetings held 5
-
6 times throughout the year.
