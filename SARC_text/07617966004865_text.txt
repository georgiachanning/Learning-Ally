School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most 
Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school us
es 
the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the 
repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The school personnel also works 
dail
y with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
inc
ludes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven.
 
Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabiliti
es); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority
: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are encouraged to 
participate in their child's education by volunteering in the classroom or the library, 
chaperoning during study trips, and helping with homework. Additionally, parents have the opportunity to serve on 
numerous committees such as School Site Council, Site 
Advisory Council, monthly Tuesday Coffee Club, and to volunteer 
in our Walking School bus Program.
 
Parent workshops are provided throughout the year by the principal and staff to help parents better assist their child at 
home. Our wonderful parents conduct
 
fundraisers, coordinate support for teachers, and schedule fun activities for their 
students. Parent University sessions are provided 2 times a year for families and cooking matter classes are offered in the 
Spring.
 
 
School Site Council (SSC): The role of
 
the SSC is to give parents, faculty and staff more on
-
site decision
-
making ability by 
giving individuals the opportunity to work together in planning school program improvements. Every elementary school 
must have a School Site Council composed of five par
ents or community members, the principal, three classroom teachers, 
and one other staff member (Education Code Section 52852).
 
 
Montalvin has a thriving Parent Teacher Student Association (PTSA). Through this partnership, we are able to further 
support par
tnership with all our stakeholders.
 
 
The school holds many meetings throughout the year that provide parents with strategies to help their children at home, 

d ask questions as 
well as English Class for those that need more practice in English.

by strong, knowledgeable instructional leaders.
 
Professional Development is provided on an on

going basis. We continue to improve our practice as educators and focus 
our staff development on cultural responsive teaching with specific emphasis on small gro
up intervention. This year we 
continue to have courageous conversations around how we can improve our practices in regards to teaching students of 
color using data driven instruction.
