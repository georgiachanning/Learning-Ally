As principal, I have the privilege of introducing you to the
 
annual School Accountability Report Card for Laguna

Parents play an important role in the 

achievement, and curriculum development can assist both school and parents in ongoing program 
improvement. We have made a commitment to provide the best educational program possible for our 
stu
dents. Our excellent staff is dedicated to ensuring that Laguna Vista Elementary School is a welcoming, 
stimulating environment where students are actively involved in meeting academic standards and developing 
positive citizenship values.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

-
20)
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 10, 2019 and confirmed that each school withi
n the district had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of Californ
ia. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standar
ds
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the tex
tbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers an
d a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
ma
terials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Laguna Vista Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The school is situated
 
on
 
11 acres. School facilities 
were built in 1962. They span 40,400 square feet, and include 25 permanent classrooms, a library/media center, grassy play fi
elds, a blacktop playground, 
administrative offices, restrooms, and storage rooms.  Every classroom is
 
equipped with computers and iPads for teacher and student use. The facility 
strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample classroom and playground space, and a staff resource room. The char
t displays the results of 
the most recent school facil
ities inspection information.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
Laguna Vista Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district govern
ing board has adopted 
cleaning standards for all schools in the district. Basic cle
aning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the school year with emphasis on 
classrooms and restrooms. A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-
free. The principal works daily with three 
custodians to 
develop sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well
-
maintained and provid
e a suitable 
learning environment. At the time this report was published, 100% of restrooms on campus were in good working order. Graffiti
 
is removed immediately 
and damage to school property repaired prior to the arrival of students whenever possible. A w
ork order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides matching funds on a dol
lar

for

dollar basis, to assist school 
districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically this includes r
oofing, plumbing, heating, 
electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor syst
ems. For the 2018
-
2019 school year, the district allocated $500,000 in funds for the deferred 
maintenance program.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

The sta
te requires all schools to develop a School Safety Plan. Components of the School Safety Plan include the following: child ab
use reporting 
procedures; teacher notification of dangerous pupils procedures; disaster response procedures; procedures for safe en
tering to, and exiting from, school;
