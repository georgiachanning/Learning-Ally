George Washington Elementary is one of 18
 
elementary/middle/ comprehensive high schools in Madera Unified School District. During 
2017
-
18, 749 TK
-
6th grade students are enrolled at the school, with classes arranged on a traditional calendar.
 
 
Advanced Learners: Although we no longer have the GATE
 
program (Gifted and Talented Education) that had been in the schools for 
years, we still work hard to provide opportunities for our advanced students. Based upon the California Assessment of Student
 
Performance and Progress (CAASPP) scores and teacher rec
ommendation, students in grades 3
-
6 are eligible to participate in several 

sixth grade 
Mathletics competition, and the Teach 1 to L
ead 1 leadership program.
 
 
Special Education Program: Washington is fully vested in the Center
-
Based Model of educating our special education students. These 
students are in the general education classroom for the majority of their day. They are provided s
upport from a special education staff 
member during a portion of their time. They are also pulled out of the general education environment for more intense work as
 
is 
determined appropriate by the special education teacher and based on the needs determined
 

Individualized Education Plan (IEP). Washington has one full time special education teacher, and one full time and one part t
ime special 
education aide to support our students.
 
 
English Learner Program: All of Washingto

Development) is taught to our English learners for 40
-
45 minutes a day. Students are grouped by their language levels so that instruction 
can be targeted towards their 
specific areas of need. The emphasis is on oral language, listening, reading, writing, and thinking. The District 
adopted a new ELA/ ELD curriculum to support our English Language Learners. Teachers progress monitor student progress in ELD
 
with 
classroom a
ssessments. The results of these assessments help teachers determine the English Language skills that need to be taught or 
reviewed.
 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data re
ported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should cont
act the school principal or the district office.

Quality, C
urrency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Madera Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018, and determined that each school within the district had sufficien
t and good quality 
textbooks, instructional ma
terials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including
 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects
 
for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved f
or use by the state are reviewed by all teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
George Washington Elementary was originally constructed in 1922 and is comprised of 33 classrooms, a multipurpose room/cafete
ria, a library, a staff 
lounge, an RSP, a music room, two st
ate preschool classrooms, an administration office, and three playgrounds. Recent school improvement projects 
involved relocating the front entrance gates so they could continue to support our closed campus and visitor policies that en
sure student and staf
f safety 
and make the front of the campus inviting and welcoming for students, parents, and community members.
 
 
All of the classrooms are in good repair, as is evidenced by the positive Williams report that Washington receives yearly.
 
 
Playground space is 
adequate for the number of students we have, providing them with ample opportunity to be active during their recess times. Th
ere 
is adequate space for staff to work. Washington has an excellent school library.
 
 
 
Cleaning Process

Page

of

The principal works daily 
with the custodial staff of 3 full
-
time employees to ensure that the school is maintained to provide for a clean and safe school. 
The 3 full
-
time custodians work a staggered shift schedule so that one custodian is always available on campus from 6:30 a.m. 
to 9:00 p.m. A three
-
person team from the district maintenance department services the larger maintenance needs about every six weeks. The site cu
stodians and district 
maintenance employees make a great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, an
d functional. To assist in this effort, the District uses a facility 
survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of School Construction. The district governing board has adopte
d cleaning standards for all 
schools in the district. A summar
y of these standards is available at the district office for review.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
 
Each year Washington is inspected by the Madera County Office of Education as part of the Williams Settlement and continues t
o meet all requirements 
for a 
safe school. District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and work orders 
are completed in a 
timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest priority is given to emergen
cy repairs. While reviewing this report, 
please note that even minor discrepancies are reported in the inspection process. The items noted in the table have been corr
ected or are in the process 
of remediation.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
 
The district par
ticipates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist school 
districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically this incl
udes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessme
nts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards,
 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
