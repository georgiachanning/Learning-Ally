By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Eric White Elementary School is one of eleven schools in the Selma Unified School District. Eric White School is considered 
to be a high
-
poverty school with 100% (Provision II school) of the students participating in the free lunch 
program. Of the 
488 students enrolled at Eric White, 95% of the students are Hispanic; .02% are Caucasian, 0.02% are African American, 
and .01% are Asian, and 0.4 are Pacific Islander, and .002% are American Indian or Alaskan Native. Currently, English 
Lea
rners comprise approximately 50% of the school population. These figures are based on 2018
-
2019 data.
 
 
Through the years, Eric White has gone through many changes to meet the needs of our growing community. In over 60 
years of service, additional buildings
 
have been constructed, and the original buildings have gone through renovations. 
Our school currently consists of 14 buildings, a library, and a modernized cafeteria/multipurpose room and kitchen. This 
year, our school houses 489 students, 19 classroom te
achers, 5 certificated support staff, 4 special education aides, 2 
bilingual instructional aides, 1 secretary, 12 campus aides, 2 part
-
time clerks, 1 program manager assistant, 1 
community/parent liaison, 4 custodians, 1 cafeteria manager, 6 food service a
ssistants, 1 library technician, 1 Positive 
Behavior Intervention (PBI) Aide, 2 program managers, 1 part
-
time psychologist, 1 part
-
time teacher librarian, and a 
principal. Our school population consists of students in Transitional Kindergarten and 2nd thro
ugh 6th grade.
 
 
Thousands of students have been educated within the walls of Dr. G.W . Eric White School. Many distinguished citizens of 
Selma are Eric White alumni. We are proud to boast that many of our current staff members w ere former Eric White 
stude
nts themselves. The staff and students are proud of their school and its accomplishments and feel a tremendous 
honor to be a part of Eric White.
 
 
The success of Eric White School has been made possible through the coordination of many programs at the site 
including: 
a focused and common core based curriculum, a targeted reading intervention program, special education services, and 
a school
-
wide emphasis on reading, writing, mathematics, and technology. In addition, Eric White offers academic 
intervention in
 
reading and math, English Language Development (ELD) for English Learner students, and a positive 
behavior intervention system called PBIS. There are additional co
-
curricular activities in which students can participate 
such as History Day, Peach Blossom 
(oral interpretation), Leadership, Spelling Bee, Songfest, Talent Show , Art, and various 
sports tournaments. Extended learning opportunities are offered for students. An after
-
school program is offered and 
serves approximately 200 students. Eric White Sch
ool staff also offer Power Hour, an after
-
school intervention program 
for students needing additional support in reading and math.
 
 
In addition to embracing the Selma Unified School District mission, the Eric White School staff has created their very own 
m
ission statement for the school. All certificated teachers were involved in the creation of the mission statement and 
display a commitment to it. The mission of the Eric White Elementary School staff is the following:  Eric White is committed 
to providing 
a rigorous, literacy
-
enriched education to all students in a safe, positive, and nurturing learning environment 
which will equip students to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Eric White School staff believes that all students can 
succeed, and all st
akeholders are dedicated to providing a safe, secure, and positive environment that enables students 
to achieve their maximum potential and develop a life
-
long love for learning.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Every year the Eric White School Safety Plan is revised and updated. The district has implemented the Selma Unified 
Procedure Guide, which is still a part of the current school safety plan. The school and 
district Emergency Procedure Guide 
includes a preparedness plan with steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a natural disaster, fire, power outage 
(facility alert), or intruder on campus. The plan also includes a comprehensive crisis plan. Fire
 
drills and lockdown drills are 
conducted monthly, and earthquake drills are conducted 3 times per year.
 
 
Additionally, to ensure the safety of all students, staff members supervise students at all times before and after school 
and during recess and lunch.
 
Visitors to the campus are required to check in at the school office and must w ear the proper 
visitor identification badge at all times. Eric White School is in the sixth year of implementing PBIS, Positive Behavior 
Intervention and Support Systems, and 
also conducts school wide anti
-
bullying training.
 
 
Selma Unified has implemented SPRIGEO at every school site, including Eric White Elementary. SPRIGEO is an electronic 
platform that gives students and their parents a tool to report bullying and other safe
ty concerns anonymously through a 
link on the school website. Teachers, parents, and students are familiar with the SPRIGEO resource and how to use it if 
needed. All students should feel safe at school and in their community. This program empowers children
 
to speak out and 
make a change. SPRIGEO notifies administrators through emails and texts to alert them of reported incidents. This 
program also stores the incident report in a secure online database, which provides school organizations with an efficient 
m
ethod of tracking and analyzing reports.
 
 
The School Safety Plan was reviewed with the staff on August 9, 2018 and continues to be a staff meeting topic at least 5 
times per year. The plan was reviewed, revised, and updated in January of 2019.

Eric White Elementary implements PBIS, Positive Behavior
 
Intervention and Supports. Our school follows the Tiger Traits 
of "Be Safe, Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Positive, and most of all, Be Kind." Students have numerous opportunities 
to earn rewards and incentives for appropriate behavior while at school
. A team of staff members meet regularly to discuss 
school wide behavior data, appropriate responses, and PBIS concepts. Through PBIS, students learn how to deal with 
scenarios that they may encounter in class or on the playground by engaging in classroom 
lessons, social skills training, 
and school wide assemblies that focus on positive social and behavior skills. Conflict resolution and behavior academies 
are offered to students through our Positive Behavior Intervention Aide at the site. Students needing 
mental health 
services are referred either to the school psychologist or the district mental health clinicians. A county mental health 
clinician works at Eric White two days per week and also provides counseling to students in need. Referrals are also made
 
by the psychologist to receive outside supports if appropriate.

Throughout the school year, teachers participate in 3 District Professional Learning Days.  The focus of the 2018
-
2019 
school year was to create school
-
wide Literacy Commitments and also review and 
refine grade level Professional 
Communities.  Teachers also had 3 Planning days throughout the school year to collaborate and review the upcoming ELA 
and Math units and prepare lesson plans and materials for the upcoming Trimester.  Each week teachers also
 
participated 
in a one hour PLC session with their grade level colleagues to discuss current data and plan instruction to meet student 
needs.
 
 
In addition, a team of 8 Eric White teachers participated in the Instructional Leadership Team and spent time rev
iewing 
and updating the Eric White Mission Statement and created a Vision Statement.
 
 
The Eric White TK teachers attended the Early Education Collaboration through Fresno County Superintendent of Schools 
and learned which supports, planning and actions sho
uld be taken to promote a quality early care and education system 
that meets the needs of all children and families.
 
 
Teachers in grades 2 through 6 attended the Fresno County Science Collaborative where grade level teams  worked 
together to create relevan
t and engaging Science units based on the New Generation Science Standards to implement in 
their classrooms.
 
 
Additional Professional Learning experiences for Eric White teachers included the following: Running Record Training 
(Grade 2), Rime Magic Trainin
g (Grades 2
-
5), Social Emotional & Academic Learning, and one 6th grade teacher received 
Academic coaching support from a District Coach throughout the school year.
 
 
Eric White administrators attended the California Title 1 Accountability Conference along 
with monthly district
-
led staff 
development.
 
 
In addition, Selma Unified School District supports and builds teacher capacity throughout the year through a Site Based 
Coaching model.  This model allows for job embedded Professional learning by implementing
 
the tenets of the Professional 
Learning Community framework. The district maintains a ELA/ELD, Math and Science coaching team that in turn support 
and provide instructional support for our site level coaching team. In collaboration with both teams, profes
sional learning 
for teachers is provided to assist all students in achieving the State academic standards, with an emphasis on addressing 
and supporting student groups requiring additional  resources; groups such as Foster Youth, English Learners, and 
Stud
ents 
with Disabilities.
 
 
The District also provides all teachers with three professional learning days throughout the year.  These are non
-
student 
days that are planned and facilitated by site leaders and site coaches.  For the last couple of years, these 
days focus on 
allowing teachers time for instructional planning as they apply to the California Standards for the Teacher Profession 
(CSTPs 3, 4, & 5).
