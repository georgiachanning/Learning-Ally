ourselves and for the approximately 342 students we serve. We collaborate to provide a Science,

Community & School Profile
 
Evergreen School District, located in the City of San Jose, is comprised of fifteen elementary schools and three middle schoo
ls. Once a 
small farming city, San Jose became a magnet for su
burban newcomers between the 1960s and the 1990s, and is now the third largest 
city in California. The city is located in Silicon Valley, at the southern end of the San Francisco Bay Area, and is home to 
more than 973,000 
residents.
 
 
The school provides a 
family
-
oriented, nurturing, and safe place for students to learn, grow, and develop intellectually. Teachers, staff, 
and administrators continue to act on the principle that students come first.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Evergreen S
chool District held a Public Hearing on October 10, 2010, and determined that each school within the district has sufficient 
and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California.
 
 
All 
students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects 
for use in the classroom and to take home. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the dist
rict must be aligned with the California State 
Content Standards, with final approval by the Board of Trustees. Textbooks and supplementary materials are typically adopted 
according to a cycle 
developed by the California Department of Education. The table 
displays information collected in September 2018 about the quality, currency, and 
availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. The district does not have a formal textbook adoption
 
for Health or for 
Visual and Performing Arts.
 
 
The California State Board of Education adopted science programs at its November 2018 public meeting.  Evergreen will review 
materials in 2019
-
20 to 
determine next steps.  The California State Board of Education adopted Social 
Science materials at its November 2017 public meeting aligned to the new 
California Framework.  The California Social Science standards remain unchanged.
 
 
Pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, a school district may utilize 
instructional materials not adopted by the SBE, so long as the 
materials are aligned to state standards and a majority of the participants of any review process conducted by the district a
re classroom teachers who 
are assigned to the subject area or grade 
level of the materials being reviewed.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
O.B. Whaley Elementary School, originally constructed in 1965, is currently comprised of 20 permanent classrooms, 16 portable
 
classrooms, two Head 
Start classrooms, two computer labs, a library, a cafe
teria/multipurpose room, a staff lounge, an ASES office, and two playgrounds.
 
 

n several classrooms, and 
lighting and roofing upgra
des were completed. The athletic field was also completely reconstructed in December 2008. Currently, two classrooms are 
being renovated into a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) Lab and new windows of permanent class
rooms are 
being 
installed. The chart displays the results of the most recent facilities inspection.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 
O.B. Whaley Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district has ado
pted cleaning standard
s 
for all schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the school year with emp
hasis on classrooms and 
restrooms. A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-
free. The pri

staff to develop sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair:
 

ustodial staff on a regular basis, with heavy maintenance 
functions occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to
 
ensure that school grounds 
and facilities remain in excellent repair. A 
work order process is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. Emergency repairs are given 
the highest priority; repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
The State 
School Deferred Maintenance Program provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures 
for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing,
 
heating, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. In the Budget Act of July 2009, the State Legislature provided sch
ool districts with flexibility in 
using these funds to meet general fund needs. In an effort
 
to mitigate the effects of declining state revenues, the Evergreen School District has taken 
advantage of this flexibility. The district will utilize bond funds and other appropriate sources to ensure its facilities ar
e clean, safe and in good repair.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
