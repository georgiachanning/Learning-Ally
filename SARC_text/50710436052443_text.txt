By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or
 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
pr
incipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Quality, 
Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
2019/10
 
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 12, 2019, and determined that each school within the distric
t had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned te
xtbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home.
 
 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used 
in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption.
 
 
The table displays information collected in August, 2019 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at 
the school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e.,
 
California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts
/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Co
re State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California S
tate University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Professional Development opportunities have afforded teachers the opportunity to receive additional training related to: 
lesson design and
 
delivery of district instructional norms to maximize student engagement during instruction; district 
adopted curricular resources; professional learning community processes; unit planning, assessment literacy and student 
investment knowledge; response to 
intervention structures and procedures; and reading strategies and instruction.
 
 
District coaches have provided classroom demonstrations and workshops, as well as lesson study professional learning in 

sitations have been equally valuable giving grade
-
level teams the 
time to view curricular areas of interest and debrief during a subsequent planning time. In addition, educational 
consultants led professional learning seminars for staff periodically throug
hout the school year.
 
 
The District participates in an Induction program and other county and state approved formal training programs dedicated 
to improving teacher quality.  In addition, the district fully supports classroom teachers with a cadre of full 
time staff 
developer/coaches who can assist with the implementation of curriculum and strategies.
 
 
School sites must include a professional development plan and budget in their school site plan.  Activities can include 
attendance at summer institutes, afte
r school or Saturday workshops, teacher release days to attend conferences, and 
grade level or department release days for in depth professional development.  All professional development is aligned to 
the district strategic plan.  The goal of all professi
onal development is to increase student achievement.
