By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Carl Smith Middle School we work hard to fulfill our mission 
of ensuring that all students, faculty, and staff are achieving, 
leading and succeeding. We provide a caring environment that seeks to develop self
-
esteem, self
-
motivation, and a sense 
of responsibility in young people. Every child is taught at grade level
, and our goal is for each student to read and write at 
grade level.
 
 
As the first step toward helping students achieve academic and social success, we encourage positive relationships and 
mutual respect among teachers, students, parents, and the community
. In this supportive and safe environment, we 
implement multiple learning strategies and provide challenging academic expectations. In 2018
-
19 we went through a 
complete reorganization of the English Language Arts and Mathematics curriculum and as resulted
 
in a strong emphasis 
on raising our language fluency, writing skills, reading comprehension and mathematics skills.
 
 
A number of enrichment opportunities continue to be available to our students to expand their classroom experiences. 
Students may particip
ate in our Athletic Program, Tulare County Office of Education CHOICES After School Program or 
become a part of our Student Council. Students always enjoy our social events, such as dances, and our many other 
programs and events that are offered throughout
 
the school year. All students are required to have physical education.
 
 
I always try to maintain a high profile within the school grounds and the community. One of my priorities is maintaining a 
high level of parental contact, be it negative or positive, 

involved in regular and very popular informational District parent meetings that occur about every four
-
five weeks on the 
Carl Smith Middle School campus. We encourage our parents to become inv
olved in the life of their student and our school 
by participating in parent organizations, parent meetings, or volunteering for different events, dances, graduation, etc.
 
 
The Vision
 
The Terra Bella Union Elementary School District shall provide a safe l
earning environment to promote an attitude of life 
long learning and prepare our students to be leaders and productive citizens of the 21st Century. We will raise levels of 
expectations in order to build resiliency and readiness in the students that will a
llow them to excel at the next academic 
level.
 
 
Mission Statement
 

 
Bella Union Elementary District learner, for who Carl 
Smith Middle School is committed to creating a safe, supportive 
environment which promotes the acquisition of skills and knowledge for life long personal growth. To this end we 
recognize that learning is a process that requires strong instructional leaders
hip, quality instruction and active 
participation of the students and parents. While maintaining high expectation we recognize the needs of the individual 
and the effect that success has on the students self esteem.

classified staff supervise students on 
campus before and after school and during recess. At noon, duty supervisors monitor students during lunchtime. All 
visitors must sign in at the principal's office and receive proper authorization to be at the school.

are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Carl Smith Middle School Safety Plan is revised annually each fall by the Site Safety Committee, which is comprised of the 
all administrators, principal, lead custodian, cafeteria manager and staff. Key elements of the plan focus on student and 
staff safet
y and emergency preparedness. Emergency and earthquake drills are held on a regular basis; fire drills are held 
once a month and secure campus drills are held various times a year. The last School Safety Plan was reviewed, updated, 
and discussed on January
 
21, 2019.  The current facilities were built in 1994. Teachers and classified staff supervise 
students on campus before and after school and during recess, and noon duty supervisors monitor students during 
lunchtime.
 
 
Discipline and Climate for Learning
 
At Carl Smith Middle School, we believe that meaningful learning must occur in a safe disciplined, and positive 
environment. Students are guided by specific rules and classroom expectations that promote respect, cooperation, 
courtesy, and acceptance to oth

opportunities to learn self
-
discipline through a system of consistent rewards and consequences for their behavior. Parents 
and students are informed of discipline po

parent/student handbook, a beginning of the year assembly, classroom orientation and school newsletters.

Professional development is viewed as a key component in providing an excellent education to the students at Carl Smith 
Middle School. Areas of focus are determined through a collaborative process 
with input from the teaching staff, School 
Site Council, ELAC/DELAC Committee, Terra Bella School Board and the administration. Decisions as to the areas of need 
are data driven with a focus on alignment to the standards. Staff development is provided at b
oth on and off site. Staff is 
encouraged to pursue in
-
services that are aligned with the California State standards and frameworks.
 
 
To facilitate implementation of the curriculum, by new and non
-
tenured teachers, the district established a Coaching 
Progra
m that actively supports the new teachers. Each teacher is assigned a grade level instructional leader, the 
instructional leader acts as a resource person or their mentor for the school year. Release time, counseling, materials 
development or overviews on 
budget expenditures are a few of their responsibilities. Grade level meetings are held twice 
a month on pertinent topics to allow a venue for discussion and support of the new staff. Monthly staff meetings are held 
with the teachers and the instructional a
ides to facilitate communication and improve the quality of instruction in the 
classroom. Instructional aides are encouraged to participate in the district in
-
service opportunities.
