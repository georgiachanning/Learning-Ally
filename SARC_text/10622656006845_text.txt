About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planne
d Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Public Sc
hool Construction. The results of this survey are available at the KCUSD Business Office. Below is 
more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are provided with a cle
an, safe, and functional 
learnin
g environment. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by speaking with the sch
ool principal.
 
 
Sheridan Elementary School has 24 classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library and an administration buildin
g. The main campus was built in 1952. 
Additional classrooms were constructed in 1966, additional relocatable classrooms were constructed in 1999, and a library was
 
constructed in 2002. in 
2018, a shade structure was installed and improvements made to playg
round equipment.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are gi
ven the highest priority.
 
 
 
The Director of Maintenance, Custodial Supervisor, and the site principals work cooperatively with the custodial staff to dev
elop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school. Sheridan Elementary School employs 3 custodi
ans to ensure that the campus is safe, clean, and sanitary. The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar for dollar bas
is.This assists school 
districts with expenditures for maj
or repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter

ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number

Sta
te Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and 
each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parent involvement and communication are essential to student success. Sheridan Elementary School strives to involve parents 
by exchanging 
information that helps parents underst
and and support school programs and by providing opportunities for parent participation in school activities. 
There are numerous and varied opportunities for parent involvement. Parents attend school functions and parent visitation day
s, participate in par
ent
-
teacher conferences, volunteer in classrooms, assist as coaches, chaperone field trips, invited to read with their child in t
he classroom for 30 minutes 
once per trimester, attend a G.A.T.E. exposition, and serve as room parents.
 
 
Parents may also serv
e on advisory committees and leadership teams, including the Parent Teacher Club (P.T.C.); the School Site Council (SSC); Eng
lish 
Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), which meets a minimum of 5 times a school year. Home and school communication are enhanced
 
through 
newsletters, parent

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension 
rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Sheridan Elementary School. All students have an emergency card on f
ile that contains such 
infor
mation as emergency phone contacts, medical allergies, and other information that would be vital in an unexpected situation. 
Before, during, and 
after school, the campus is monitored by campus supervisor(s) and assigned staff. All visitors must sign in at 
the office.
 
 
The comprehensive school safety plan is designed to assist in preparing for emergencies, managing emergency response efforts,
 
and maintaining a safe 
school environment. The plan requires identification of security needs, development of prevention and inter
vention techniques, evaluation of physical 
facilities, and communication with staff and students. Components of the plan include child abuse reporting procedures, proce
dures for teacher 
notification of dangerous pupils, disaster response procedures, proced
ures for safe ingress and egress from school, sexual harassment policies, and 
suspension and expulsion policies. The safety plan is reviewed annually, updated as needed, and fully compliant with federal 
and state regulations. The 
plan was last reviewed/upd
ated in August 2019 and discussed with the staff in August 2019. An updated copy is available to the public at the school 
office.
 
 
The school disaster preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring the safety of students and staff during a disaster. Emergen
cy preparedness drills are 
conducted regularly and the school staff is appropriately trained.
