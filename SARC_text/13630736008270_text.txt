By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 2019
 
 
The school district held a public 
hearing on September 24, 2019 and on December 10, 2019, and determined that each 
school within the district had sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment 
pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of
 
California. All students, including English Learners, are given their 
own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are ado
pted according to a cycle developed by the California 
Department of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use 
by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the scho
ol Board by a selection committee 
composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district 
office prior to adoption.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Built in 1935 and modernized in 1996, the school is situated 
on six acres. School buildings span more than 36,600 square 
feet, and consist of 24 permanent classrooms, four portable classroom, a multipurpose room, a library, a band room, a 
playground, administrative offices, restrooms, and storage rooms.
 
 
Cleaning Pr
ocess & Schedule
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A team of three custodians 
ensures classrooms, restrooms, and campus grounds (one itinerant custodian, assigned for 5 hours/week) are kept clean 
a
nd safe every day.  A summary of these standards is available at the school office or at the district office. The site 
administration team works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance personnel are 
proactive and conduct inspections at school sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
a
nd working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure that the highest priority is 
given to emergency repairs.
 
 
While reviewing this report, please note that even minor discrepancies are reported in the inspection proces
s. The items 
noted in the table have been corrected or are in the process of remediation.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis, t
o assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building 
components. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor 
systems.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Miguel Hidalgo Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The school 
complies with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous material
s and state earthquake standards. Many 
people visit the campus to volunteer in the classroom and participate in school events. Parents and visitors are welcome 
however, the school is a closed campus and all visitors must check in at the front office and re

 
 
Visitors are required to return to the school office upon departure. School grounds are monitored before, during, and 
after school by assigned staff including administration, teachers, and noon duty supervisors to ensure a safe an
d orderly 
environment.
 
 
Brawley Elementary School District established a very detailed disaster plan from each of its schools in the event of a 
disaster. The plan clearly explains specific duties and responsibilities for all levels of staff and site 
personnel, including 
aides, custodians, health services personnel, cafeteria staff, and library staff, and is designed to ensure student and staff
 
safety during a disaster. The Comprehensive School Safety Plan was developed by the district in consultation 
with local 
law enforcement in order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan was designed to assist in preparing for emergencies, managing emergency 
response efforts, and maintaining a safe school environment. The plan 
requires identification of security needs, 
development of prevention and intervention techniques, evaluation of physical facilities, and communication with staff 
and student. The plan provides students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learn
ing environment. 
Components of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan include current status of school crime, child abuse reporting 
procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe ingress 
and 
egress from school, the sexual harassment policy, the dress code, and procedures related to the compliance of existing 
laws as they affect school safety.
 
 
Fire drills are conducted monthly throughout the school year, earthquake drills conducted twice a yea
r, and disaster drills 
conducted annually.  In consultation with local law enforcement, Secure Campus and School Lockdown drills are 
conducted periodically.  Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Plan, are reviewed with school and 
distri
ct staff in the fall, at the start of each school year. An updated copy of the plan is available to the public at the distric
t 
office. The plan was last updated and reviewed with school staff in the Fall 2019. New information is immediately 
distributed to 
all staff.

During the 17

18 school year, the BESD plan for action was titled "Championing Student Learning".  This plan included 
intensive work with WestEd to provide English Learners with language instruction coupled with CCSS.  In addition, we have 
partnered with C
OEs to provide ELA Unit Development planning for our grade levels, as well as providing math support 
for the BESD Math Committee.  We will continue to provide time for collaboration to support our endeavor to become a 
professional learning community.  Our 
PD Plan for 18

professional development in supporting our RtI supplemental programs. We had a large group of educators participate in 
a BeGLAD Pilot in 18
-
19; educators received 6 intensive days of 
professional development.  In addition, we are now in our 
third year of PBIS training, with the goal of supporting students not only academically, but also behaviorally.    Our focus 
for 19
-
20 is to create a sustainable model that includes ongoing training
 
in the following areas:  BeGLAD certification, PBIS, 
grade level math collaboration focused on content and mathematical practices, and new teacher instructional support.  
This year, we have also begun our journey with Professional Learning Communities.  F
inally, this is our first year to 
introduce Co
-
Teaching in two of our schools, with a goal of including all schools in the future. We continue to utilize the 
expertise of our Academic Coaches to provide differentiated teacher support at the site level.  Wh
ile our goal is to keep 
teachers in the classroom, we offer training scheduled during the school day, as well as after school.  Our site Educational 
Technology Mentors continue to offer hands

on support to their site teachers, including  training opportuni
ties scheduled 
at the end of the school day.
