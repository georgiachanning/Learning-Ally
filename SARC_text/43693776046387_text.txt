By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General: The district places a strong emphasis on ensuring that all schools are safe, clean, environmentally friendly, 
mechanically functional and
 
inviting for students, staff members, and the community. To assist in this effort, the district 
utilizes Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC and local operations department developed 
inspection survey methods to keep f
acilities in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. The 
district regularly inspects and reviews the condition of the school facilities and surrounding grounds. The district places 
the highest priority on those safeguards that 
impact the fire, life and safety protection of the students, staff, and school 
buildings. Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students 
are provided with a clean, safe, and functional learnin
g environment.
 
 
Age of School Buildings: Northwood was opened in 1965. This school has 26 regular classrooms, a multipurpose room, a 
library, and an administration building. In addition to the main buildings, there are seven portable classrooms that 
have 
been added to accommodate significant student growth, special programs, after school community programs, and a 
daycare center.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and
 
working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order system process is used to ensure efficient service and 

in good working o
rder. This site also had interior and exterior lighting upgrades completed through Prop. 39 initiatives in 
identified areas throughout the campus.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule: The district has developed cleaning standards and schedules for all schools i
n the district. 
A summary of these standards and schedules is available at the school or the Maintenance & Operations office. The 
principal, with the guidance of the maintenance supervisor works daily with the custodial team to ensure that the cleaning 
sta
ndards are met, and that classrooms, restrooms, and campus grounds are kept clean, safe, and well
-
maintained.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

-
20)
 
 
The Northwood PTA 
provides many venues for parent involvement. The Northwood School PTA is a visible and energetic 
group that raises funds for our students and school programs. The PTA board meets monthly while the general 
membership meets every other month. Our Northwood P
TA is instrumental in fund raising to support classroom and 
school
-
wide activities. The PTA works to provide education and support to parents, to plan events that involve the school 
staff, students, and families, and to schedule assemblies. PTA plans and s
upports family and school community events, 
gives $3,500 yearly for special enrichment assemblies for our students, sponsors the Scholastic Book Fair, and helps 
provide student scholarships for science camp and other enrichment trips. PTA also sponsors a s
pecial end

-
the
-
year 
activity for our greeters and other students who provide service to the school.
 
 
Throughout the school year, the Northwood School Site Council provides input, monitors, and approves the school plan 
and budget. Our school site council
, comprised of four parent and four staff members, meets monthly to review school 
events, analyze our school plan and current academic and demographic data, monitor the Northwood budget, and 
consider school issues.
 
 
Many parents in our community volunteer 
in the classroom assisting teachers with curriculum or program needs, reading 
with students, demonstrating art and cooking activities and chaperoning field trips. A group of parents volunteer on a 
regular basis to bring the ABC Program from Project Corners
tone to our primary level students. These parents read stories 
and lead discussions around character building and asset development themes.
 
 
School leadership works with on
-
site resources including the School Social Worker and district Instructional Coache
s to 
provide ongoing workshops and information sessions to engage parents in subjects like Social Emotional Learning and 
SBAC Testing Preparation and information. The goal of these sessions is to create long
-
term partnerships and shared 
understanding to pr
omote student success.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Representatives from the Northwood staff 
participate on the Berryessa safe school committee. They communicate 
important information regarding the safety plan and procedures to the school staff. Northwood also has a site safety 
committee. Every year Northwood's school safety committee reviews the 
fire and earthquake drill procedures. Earthquake 
drill triage is performed in Northwood Park. The entire campus practices the emergency procedures for either 
earthquakes, fires, or campus lockdowns on a monthly basis. Our students become familiar with thes
e emergency drill 
procedures and their purpose. The school safety committee updates these emergency procedures annually.
 
 
Every year, Northwood faculty, students, and PTA participate in Red Ribbon "Say No to Drugs" Week with special 
curriculum and ceremoni
es. Safety assemblies are held to review schoolwide rules, procedures, and expectations for 
behavior. The staff supervises school grounds during recess and before and after school. Since the south side of the 
Northwood School campus is exposed to Northwood
 
Park, doors on this side of the campus are kept locked during the 
day to prevent any unwelcome intrusion into classrooms. We are working on providing each classroom with a walkie talkie 
for emergency communication. In addition, each classroom is outfitted
 
with a container of emergency supplies for use in 
the event of an earthquake or other emergency.
 
 
Emergency information for students and staff members is kept on file in the office. Additionally, staff members annually 
fill out a safety survey and list an
y CPR, first aid, or other safety certification training that they may have so that their skills 
and training may be put to use in the event of an emergency.

school sit e to 
identify the students who need extra support based upon district benchmarks or teacher recommendations. 
Each school site selects certificated and classified staff to teach these SI classes, usually after school (1 

 
3 days a week). 
Each school also identif
ies the curriculum that will be used. The majority of the school sites select computer

Professional Development this school year occurred on many different levels 

 
before school started (summer of 2019) 
and ongoing throughout the 2019 

 
2020 
school year.  The district office working with our site principals and curriculum 
leadership teams developed the scope/sequence of the professional development.  Leadership teams reviewed student 
data produced from benchmark tests, ELPAC, and SBAC data, as
 
well as staff feedback when developing the scope and 
sequence.
 
 
At the beginning of the school year, all certificated and classified staff participated in two days of professional 
development aligned to their instructional role and needs.  TK
-
5 teachers r
eceived training on providing effective Tier 1 
instruction in math and ELA.  Special education staff, social workers and psychologists received training on topics pertinent
 
to their needs such as All Learning is Social Emotional, TCI De
-
Escalation, Instruc
tional Scaffolding to Assist and Support 
Student , and Data Collection and Behavior Management.  Middle school staff received specialized training related to the 
content they teach, that focused on the social emotional element of learning as well as recent
ly adopted curriculum.  All 
middle school teachers participated in a workshop on understanding gender.  Training for new teachers focused on 

h their 
certificated colleagues in order to have the opportunity to collaborate while learning.  They also attended other sessions 
designed to meet their specific professional needs.
 
 
During the school year middle school, science teachers were released up 
to three days to collaborate on implementation 
of the new science program.  Middle school math and writing teachers scored and/or analyze student benchmarks during 
release days for each grade.  7th grade science teachers were released for 1
-
2 days for trai

comprehensive sexuality program.  Additional training was offered on release day for special education teachers to 
support implementation of our dyslexia curriculum as well as special education components of our ELA programs.
 
 
Throug
hout the school year, we offered monthly professional development sessions in which all teachers participated (1.5 
hours on 10 early release Thursday afternoons).  Principals and district office administrators chose the topics for the 2019
-
2020 school year
 
in alignment with the District focus on developing a multi
-
tiered system of support.
 
 
The Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL) program was implemented at six of our ten elementary schools in grades TK
-
3.  The schools included were Cherrywood, Laneview, 
Summerdale, Brooktree, Toyon and Vinci Park.   Teachers in the first 
two years of implementation received three two
-
day training modules each followed by a day of unit planning.  Teachers 
in the third and fourth year of implementation participated in three
 
days of unit planning.  Contracted SEAL experts 
provided the module training sessions and three district instructional coaches facilitated the follow up planning PD 
sessions.  Teachers were released from their classrooms for all of these PD days.
 
 
Four in
structional coaches provided BTSA induction training for all teachers who qualified to receive BTSA training and 
support. Additionally, BUSD teachers provide PAR assistance to teachers who are in need of additional assistance.  All 
teachers have access to 
an instructional coach so that they can receive follow up support on implementing new learning 
attended through professional development.
 
 
An MTSS committee and Differentiated Assistance Team received 3
-
5 days of training on change management facilitated 
b
y WestEd and the Santa Clara County Office of Education.  Some members also participated in 3 training sessions of 
equity.  Team members then trained principals during monthly professional development meetings.   The focus of both 
teams aligned with the di
strict goal of developing multi
-
tiered systems of support at each site.
