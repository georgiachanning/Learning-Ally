By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

our children are socially emotionally prepared for 21
st
 
Century success.
 
Mission of Sundance: 
To ensure that our students are life
-
ready by blending strong foundational skills with multiple 
opportunities to apply those skills in creative, fun, and innovative ways. 
 
Theory of Action
 
If we provide social emotional safety for our students, then studen
ts will be able to engage in rich meaningful, purposeful 
tasks and conversations to advance their learning.
 
The Sundance PTA, School Site Council, and Twin Trails Education Foundation also believe in and support the
 
mission 
statement.

supported our
 
mission by allocating resources and appr
oving the SPSA to
 
ensure our staff and students participate in 
activities that support the college
-
bound mission. The Twin Trails Education Foundation has made large purchases in the 
area of technology, such as computers for the lab, DocuCams, software, an
d staff support to ensure our students receive 
the best educational experience possible. This year the Foundation has committed to furthering student learning by 
purchasing iPad types of technology.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Poway Unified School District ensures that students attend clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the District uses a School 
Facilities Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each of its schools is maintained in good repair.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  Daily c
leaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and well maintained.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A night custodial crew cleans clas
srooms, restrooms and offices daily.  
The district has adopted cleaning standards for all schools.  A summary of these standards is available at the district offic
es.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Research supports the positive impact professional development has on increasing student learning. At Sundance, we 
provide opportunities for 
teachers to learn how to implement the new California State Standards.
 
 
We have already 
provided professional development in the areas of Writing, ELA, and Math. In addition to these core subjects, the staff 
annually chooses focuses areas as content for fu
rther professional development.
 
 
The focus areas from this year 
are:
 
 
Response to Intervention/ Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support, Benchmark, NGSS, Character Education, and Math 
Extension.
 
 
 
 
Currently, the staff has completed training from Sanford Harmony, 
which focuses on Social Emotional Learning aspects 
for children and adults. The staff is committed to the full implementation of this program while simultaneously 
implementing strategies from PBIS.
 
 
Another focus area for the staff this year revolves aroun
d increase choice for 
students.
 
 
Recent staff meetings have focused on a Playlist.
 
 
This process allows students to choose between must do's 
and choice items.
 
 
 
 
Staff development on campus occurs primarily after school or on site pro
-
grow afternoons, of w
hich there are two.
 
 
The 
teachers are supported in their efforts through regular classroom walk
-
throughs by the principal and LSS Executive 
director.
