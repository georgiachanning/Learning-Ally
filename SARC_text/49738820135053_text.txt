School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School Description: Richard Crane Elementary is a year
-
round school with a population of approximately 192 students 
located in the C section of the Cotati Rohnert Park Unified School District. Richard Crane was reo
pened in the 2017 
-
2018 
school year. All instruction is based on the Common Core Standards. To teach and address the social emotional needs of 
our students we use the Second
-
Step and Second Step Bulling curriculum. Additionally, we are beginning year one o
f 
Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS). Behavioral expectations are modeled, clearly taught and students 
are commended for being respectful, safe and responsible. Monthly assemblies recognize students who demonstrate 
positive student behav
ior. School wide procedures and expectations provide a safe and orderly learning environment. To 
help ensure all students are successful academically, physically, socially and emotionally we support our students by 
focusing on effective first instruction, 
our Response to Intervention program, Walk To Read, mindfulness, and by teaching 
the Second Step Program school wide. Richard Crane is focused on creating a school culture that is caring and safe, and 
students are permitted to take academic risks so studen
ts are ready to learn. We are building partnerships with Rancho 
Cotate High School, our school community, and our larger community. Richard Crane's PTA plays a vital role in engaging 
parents, students and teachers as we work together to enrich our students
' experiences through supporting programs and 
activities. The funds raised through the PTA have enabled us to offer Drama Club, a School
-
wide play, participation in the 
County Spelling Bee, school assemblies and community building Family Fun Nights. In add
ition, the PTA has purchased 
robotic sets and recess and PE equipment for our students. Our Cougar Cub pride can be seen everyday throughout our 
campus.
 
 
Vision: Our vision at Richard Crane Elementary is to provide a rich educational environment where all 
students are fully 
engaged in their learning. We believe it is critical for elementary school students to excel academically, emotionally, 
socially, and physically in order to grow into thriving students. These foundational beliefs are implemented into the
 
teaching and learning for our students and define our school community. "A community where students are nurtured and 
empowered to excel as lifelong learners."
 
 
Mission: At Richard Crane Year Round Elementary School we are focused on meeting the unique nee
ds of every student. 
We established practices that support the learning of the whole child to enable students to reach their learning potential. 
Through project based learning (PBL) and experiential activities, students explore the real work by thinking cr
itically, 
collaborating, creating and communicating their understanding through a variety of methods. When our students promote 
to middle school, they will be empowered to succeed at high levels.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Prior to the reopening of our school, Richard Crane was completely remodeled.  A new kindergarten building was built to 
house our TK and K students. The kindergarten bathrooms are ADA compliant and accessible to all the kindergarten 
students within the bui
lding. The other school buildings were remodeled. Windows with shades were installed to let in 
natural light. Motion sensor lights were installed to provide adequate lighting for optimum working conditions. Classrooms 
are equipped with new ducts for heatin
g and air conditioning, furniture, technology, sound field systems, telephones, 
carpet, paint, and roofs. All bathrooms are ADA compliant. Prior to opening, all emergency alarms, fire extinguishers, and 
water systems were tested to ensure they were in prop
er working condition. All new playground structures were installed. 
All safety and maintenance requested are dealt with in a timely manner to ensure the safety of our staff and students.

Richard Crane has focused on building a strong community and providing opportunities for parent involvement. Parents 
are encouraged to participate in the classroom and with all school activities. Communication is an important aspect in 
assisting parents to
 
become and stay involved in our community. Teachers communicate with families via various 
classroom apps and emails. As a school we let families know what is happening thorough our school and PTA Facebook
