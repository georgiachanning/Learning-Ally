Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Maintaining the appearance, safety and functionality of Handy Elementary is important. The District Maintenance and 
Operations department has work
ed to upgrade our campus in order to provide a safe and secure environment for 
students. The carpeting has been removed from some classrooms and tile is being installed. The office has been outfitted 
with a new phone system to answer more calls through the
 
use of a voicemail system. The Fathers' Club built, repaired 
and painted classroom cubbies, ball carts, installed hooks for backpacks, and built shelves for our disaster preparedness 
storage area. The school custodian and principal consistently check the 
facility for safety concerns and submit a monthly 
safety report to the District.
 
 
The Maintenance Department of the Orange Unified School conducts an inspection of the site each school year.  Following 
the inspection, they complete a Facilities 
Inspection Tool (FIT).

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

32289, a Comprehensive 
Safe School Plan particular to their site. Each school site is required annually, by March 1st, to have reviewed, and if 
necessary, updat
ed their Safe School Plan. Each school forwards its Safe School Plan to the district through the office of 
Student and Community Services. The office of Student and Community Services provides plan development assistance to 
the schools and maintains a file
 
of individual school plans available for inspection by the public.
 
 
A comprehensive disaster plan is in effect and fire and/or earthquake drills are conducted monthly. All schools in the 
district are linked through an emergency radio contact system, and d
istrict radio drills are held periodically to be prepared 
in case of an actual disaster. Providing a safe environment for our students is of paramount concern at Handy Elementary. 
Our staff is constantly on the alert to make our school a safe place for stu
dents. Each year we update and practice our 
Emergency Preparedness Plan. All personnel are provided with orange safety vests to wear when on duty. Our School 
Safety Plan will be updated and reviewed in February 2020.
