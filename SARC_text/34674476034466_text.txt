By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

We have made a strong commitment to provide a positive climate for learning in which all students can reach their 
fullest potential in academics, attitudes, athletics
, and the arts. Specifically: 
 

 
We strive to create and maintain an atmosphere that fosters the healthy emotional, intellectual, social, and 
physical growth of each student.
 

 
We recognize the mastery of academic skills as stated in the Common Core State 
Standards as a primary goal.
 

 

 

 
We believe in the development of curriculum that encourages diversity, consideration for others, compassion, 
empathy, res
ponsibility and self

We emphasize that learning is not confined to four walls of a classroom and that it does not end with the school 
years.
 

 
We acknowledge that we learn best in a positive environment of sharing, caring, laughing, questioning, 
risk 
taking, learning, and growing.

Principal's Message:
 
Dear Coyle Avenue Elementary Families,
 
 
I am thrilled to join you here at Coyle Avenue Elementary in the pursuit of a solid educational foundation for your child! I 
have spent more than 18 years in the educa
tional field and all of those here in San Juan Unified. I spent 11 years as a 
teacher and academic coach and the last 8 years have been as a principal. 
 
 
At Coyle Avenue, we are excited to be your partner in the education of your child. In addition to our 
curriculum focus 
around the CA Common Core State Standards, everyone here teaches and lives by our school rules: Respect, Responsibility, 
Courage, Caring, Honesty and Cooperation. We are a Restorative Practices school supported with Mindfulness curriculum 
and activities. By supporting our own learning and the learning of others, we know we can all do great things! 
 
 
It is our goal to have as many parents as possible be active members of our educational community. We encourage parents 
to participate in any a
nd all school activities. Please look at our school calendar on our webpage and school newsletters 
that will come to your email inbox for information about PTA, Coyle Cafe, Coyle Family Nights, and Star Struck Showcase! 
We know it takes a team to help chil
dren grow and learn, and we are pleased to be part of your team!

Year and month in which data were 
collected:
 
September, 2019
 
 
San Juan Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018 and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the 
settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. 
Textbo
oks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers a
nd a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption. The table displays information collec
ted in September 2018 about the quality, currency, and availability of 
the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. If you would like more information 
on the textbooks and instructional materials please visit our we
bsite: http://www.sanjuan.edu/Page/23485 In July 2009, 
EC Section 60200.7. The State Board of Education has adopted frameworks for ELA/ELD, Math, Science and Social 
Sciences, and has identified an approved list of instructional materials available for adop

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
As of October 2011, Coyle Avenue is the proud reci
pient of a new wing build using funds from Measure J.  The wing 
includes two classrooms and a double
-
sized library and training room.
 
 
Coyle Avenue School received extensive outside remodeling during the summer of 2008.  A new drive
-
through parking lot 
was funded by a $200,000 donation from Mercy San Juan Medical Center.   A new flag pole, new seat walls, a widened 
front walkway, a new planter, and new grass were added in front of the school.  The playground and the front parking lot 
were completely repa
ved and re
-
striped.  A new courtyard was installed and the sidewalks by the classrooms were 
widened.   During the summer of 2013, student restrooms were completely upgraded along with fittings for ADA 
compliance.
 
 
Coyle Avenue Elementary was 
modernized during the 1999
-
2000 school year. The scope included roof repair/replacement, 
interior and exterior painting, new lighting, selected window system replacement, energy
-
efficient heating and cooling 
system upgrade, new doors with handicapped acces
sible hardware, restroom restoration, electrical infrastructure 
upgrade to provide for internet, cable, telephone, throughout the school. Currently, there is sufficient space to house the 
student population. There is a site custodial staff that cleans the 
building, along with district support for major/minor 
repairs. The district provides gardening and landscape services on a regular schedule. Regular fire/emergency drills are 
held, and badges are required for all visitors and personnel. Field repair, drive
way resurfacing, irrigation system retrofit, 
and portable replacement are planned improvements with Measure J Bond funds. Summer 2008 a new parking lot was 
added (funds were donated by Mercy San Juan Hospital) along with a major landscape and irrigation pr
oject funded by 
Measure
-
J Bond. Summer 2008 the hard court was overlaid through Deferred Maintenance.    All restrooms site
-
wide 
were reconfigured and renovated in Fall 2013 using Measure J funds.  This included all plumbing, fixtures, partitions, floors
, 
walls, path of travel and upgrades to meet ADA requirements.
 
 
Coyle Avenue has wireless internet access throughout its classrooms. A school garden was added in the Spring of 2016 
with a partnership between Del Campo High School's Kids Helping Kids and Coyl
e Avenue.

The Board of Education and the Superintendent's policy is to ensure that all students are provided with a safe and well
-
maintained learning environment. The board approved resolutions in 1998 and 2002 to adequately fund maintenance 
activities an
d preserve the repairs and improvements funded by two facility bond measures. The school buildings, 
classrooms and grounds are safe, clean and functional. An inspection of the facility was conducted in October 2019 and 
determined that there were no unsafe 
conditions that required emergency repairs. District maintenance staff ensures 
that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
computer automated work order process is used to ensure effici
ent service and that emergency repairs and health and 
safety repairs are given the highest priority. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards and custodial staffing 
requirements for all schools in the district. This school meets the Board's st
andards for custodial staffing and cleanliness. 
The school's custodians are trained in the proper use of cleaning chemicals and Integrated Pest Management techniques. 
They are managed day to day by the Principal with assistance from the district's maintena
nce department. The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, with funding allocated for major repair or replacement 
of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning
, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. Annually the district budgets $2 million dollars for deferred 
maintenance activities.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are 
encouraged and welcomed to become a part of our school community.  They are part of our educational team, 

because of the commitment, sup
port, and dedication of our parents to our students and staff.  Parents participate at Coyle 
in many ways: classroom volunteers for day
-
to
-
day classroom instruction, after
-
school help, field trips, classroom docents, 
parent conferences, Academic Parent Tea
cher Teams (APTT) meetings, Coyle Cafes, Coyle Skate Nights, School Site 
Council, P.T.A., and Superintendent's Parent Advisory Committee.
 
 
Parents are encouraged to join P.T.A. and are asked throughout the year to help with many school activities.  Our mon
thly 
P.T.A. meetings are held on the second Tuesday of the month in the evening.  The P.T.A. Executive Board meets at 6 p.m. 
for half an hour before the regular meetings.  The P.T.A. provides enrichment to our students and families through:  family 
nights,
 
book fairs, school assemblies, funds for classroom materials, funds for field trips, materials for both the computer 
lab and the library.  For information about the P.T.A., please call 916

Coyle has an English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) that meets four times a year in December, February, April and 
May in conjunction with our APTT meetings.  The goal is to inform the parents of our English learners about programs at 
Coyle that help their children learn English and be successful academically.  Parents are taught about the School Site 
Council, the English Language Proficiency Assessment for California (ELPAC), the School's Language Census (R
-
30 Report), 
progress notices
 
and report cards, interventions used at Coyle, and services that are available.  We also train parents in 
their responsibilities to make their children successful.
 
 

oversee The 
School Plan
 
for 
Student Achievement (SPSA).  Five members of the School Site Council are parents and community members, three 
members are teachers, one is a classified staff member and the tenth member is the Principal.  The Site Council monito
rs 
all programs and budgets at Coyle and seeks ways to improve the academic performance of all students.
 
 
Parents are kept informed about school activities through: the weekly school newsletter which parents receive by email, 
P.T.A. bulletins, classroom ne
wsletters, the Parent/Student Handbook, parent education nights, School Site Council 
meetings, P.T.A. meetings, parent conferences, Student Study Team meetings, Positive Behavior Support Action Team 
meetings, School Messenger phone messages, flyers, social
 
media, and assessment forms.   Coyle has an active website 
where you can check us out and access our many links to help you improve your child's education.  
http://www.sanjuan.edu/CoyleAvenue.cfm.  Our Facebook page has almost 400 members 
-
 
we want our co
mmunity to 
be informed on all that we are doing at school!
 
 
During the 2016
-
2017 school year, we implemented Academic Parent Teacher Teams (APTT). Teachers were trained on 
creating teams with parents to provide support to their students.  At three APTT mee
tings, parents look at their student's 
data, create a SMART goal and learn an activity or game that supports skill development.  Students are at school only 10% 
of their life to age 18 
-
 
parents quickly understand schools can't do it alone!  Parents must b
e a driving force in the 
education of their child.  We have 100% of our classes using APTT this year.

school. The Depu
ty Sheriffs are assigned to patrol a geographic zone either on the east side of the district or the west side 
of the district. They are assigned specific schools within their assigned zone and respond to this school, or others, as safe
ty 
needs dictate. The
 
two CHPD Police Officers are School Resource Officers (SRO) who work identified schools within the 
City of Citrus Heights and respond as safety needs dictate. The two law enforcement agencies will overlap response when 

or CHPD Officers are dispatched to critical incidents via the Safe Schools Dispatcher, 
a law enforcement dispatcher or via a direct report from a school staff member, school visitor or other person. This school 
has a school safety team which reviews safety
 
matters that may affect the campus. Our school safety team meets regularly 
to discuss safety issues, update our site emergency plan, and to take steps to be proactive in preventing various types of 
school
-
related safety issues. Community Safety Specialist
s and law enforcement provides speakers to address students, 
staff and community groups on matters of school safety. Our safety team receives training, when requested, from Safe 
Schools or law enforcement. This school is responsible for updating our Compre
hensive School Safety Plan (CSSP) by March 
1st of every year per the Education Code. As part of the update, this school meets at least once per year with a law 
enforcement officer to review the CSSP, has the local fire department review the CSSP and we hol
d a community meeting 
to review the CSSP. The CSSP must be approved by the School Site Council before being submitted to the district safe 

e 
site specific crisis response procedures and a district standardized emergency flip chart. This school conducts and keeps a 
record of all fire drills, lockdown drills, shelter in place drills and/or earthquake drills up to or in excess of what is re
quire
d 
by the Education Code.

Professional development is a key part of the continuous improvement process for educators. The goal of our quality 
professional development is to support the 
learning of teachers and paraprofessionals to positively impact student 
achievement.  Annually, teachers and site administrators participate in professional development in a variety of 
opportunities.  Seventy
-
five minutes per week are dedicated to staff co
llaboration and training planned by site leadership 
teams. The District also provides a cycle of continuous professional development for Administrators through Principal 
Networks as well as Leadership Academies.
 
 
The District provides professional developm
ent opportunities for teachers and administrators that support the 
implementation of Common Core State Standards in English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and the 
ELA/ELD Framework.  Specific professional development initiatives inclu
de: Culturally Responsive Practices, Critical 
Literacy, TK
-
2 Reading, Supporting Independence and Engagement through Reading and Writing, Math to the Core, 
Expository Reading and Writing Course, and ELD Foundations.  District departments, Center for Teache
r Support, grant
-

development opportunities are voluntary for teachers and are provided throughout the year in a variety of formats: during 
the 
school day, after school, on Saturdays, and during summer and vacation breaks. Many teachers and administrators 
also take advantage of opportunities with Sacramento County Office of Education, California Department of Education, 
the college/university prog
rams, state/national education organizations, and private educational institutes.
 
 
What grounds the professional development in the district is the District Strategic Plan and the Local Control 
Accountability Plan. Professional Development is further deter
mined using one or more of the following: (a) student 
achievement data, (b) staff survey data, and (c) district
-
identified goals.  Professional development addresses the Common 
Core State Standards, teaching strategies, curriculum, assessment, technology, 
classroom management, safety, and 
leadership. Administrator training accompanies professional development in district focus areas, providing 
implementation support for teachers on site.  Content
-
area coaches are available at some schools.  Additional class
room 
support is provided to new and struggling teachers by consulting teachers from the Center for Teacher Support.
 
 
Paraprofessionals are encouraged to participate in professional development at the district and site level.  Specifically 
designed training
 
is also offered to non
-
instructional support staff such as clerical and custodial staff that includes both 
operational and instructional topics.
