About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district custodial and maintenance staff takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. 
To assist in this effort, the district 
uses a facility surve
y instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of this survey are availa
ble at the 
KCUSD Business Office.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure
 
that students are provided with a clean, safe, and 
functional learning environment. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by spe
aking with the school 
principal.
 
 
McCord Elementary School has 21 classrooms, a
 
multipurpose room, a library, and an administration building. The main campus was built in 1958. 
Additional relocatable classrooms were constructed in 1996 and 1998.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good
 
repair and working order are completed promptly. A work order 
process is used to provide efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
The Director of Maintenance, Custodial Supervisor, and the site principals work cooperat
ively with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on dollar for
 
dollar basis to assist school 
dis
tricts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roo
fing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
Recent facility improvements and additions include solar panel installation in the staff parking lot and added cement between
 
the cafeteria and room 
16.  The added cement has enhanced the appearance of the area and provided additional space for events that
 
students, staff, and parents can enjoy.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarte
r Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible s
tudents 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter

ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary 
concern of McCord Elementary School. Before, during, and after school, the campus is monitored by assigned 
staff. All visitors must sign in at the office and wear appropriate identification while on campus. The comprehensive school 
safety plan is designed 
to 
assist in preparing for emergencies, managing emergency response efforts, and maintaining a safe school environment. The plan
 
requires the 
identification of security needs, development of prevention and intervention techniques, evaluation of physical fa
cilities, and communication with staff 
and students. McCord School has a total of six surveillance cameras around campus.  Components of the plan include child abus
e reporting procedures, 
procedures for teacher notification of dangerous pupils, disaster re
sponse procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress from school, sexual 
harassment policies, and suspension and expulsion policies. The safety plan is reviewed annually, updated as needed, and full
y compliant with federal 
and state regulations. A cop
y of the plan is on file with the Orange Cove Police Department.  The plan was last reviewed/updated on 2

school concerns. Data is

development.  Professional development may 
take the form of training, coaching, peer observation, or constructive self
-
reflection and are consistent with our school vision and goals. Principal, 
teachers, instructional aides, and other support personnel ma
y take part in these activities.
