Reported Using Data from the 2018

19 School Year
 
Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
All buildings are in good repair; the campus is maintained to assure that it is clean, safe, and func
tional. The oldest school 
buildings are over 30 years old and the newest portables are over 20 years old. Our campus environment is clean and well 
maintained and thus fully supports teaching and learning. A work order process is in place to attend to maint
enance issues 
in a timely manner with urgent and emergency repairs given priority. Every restroom is cleaned regularly and has 100% of 
the toilets working. The building is cleaned regularly by one full time day custodian as well as one full time and one pa
rt 
time night custodians. The district's policy to address any areas of concern within the facility is to submit a work order to
 
the maintenance department and they address the issues in a timely fashion. Safety issues are addressed immediately.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of 
study.

the year.  Topi
cs covered include:   technology, math strategies, literacy and family activities.  Parents are invited to student 
performances, assemblies, and special day activities like the First Day of School Celebration & Field Day, as well as the 
district wide paren
t trainings.  Parents are encouraged to volunteer in the classroom as much as possible and to chaperone 
field trips. We have a volunteer recognition event that honors volunteers who continually serve in the classroom or on 
school campus. We send home a mon
thly newsletter highlighting all events so parents stay informed and can be involved.

Gabilan staff members are given the opportunity to participate in a multitude of professional development opportunities. 
School and district needs are taken into account when determining professional development through input given by staff, 
School Site Co
uncil, needs assessments, and data.  This year, staff development occurred on six full day training days and 
during weekly faculty meetings. Additionally, intensive PLC staff development has occurred.  Further, teachers recieve 
specialized coaching session
s in the areas of ELA & Math throughout the year by utilizing the district TOSAs.  The EL TOSA 
works with teachers individually to determine how to best support building their skill sets.  The technology committee 
holds monthly technology days in which the
y rotate through classrooms teaching others about new approaches for 
increasing technology use in the classroom.  Additionally, the PBIS committee attends planning sessions at various points 
throughout the year to increase the school's implementation of PB
IS.  Weekly staff meetings topics of focus have included 
PLC, language arts, math, technology, PBIS, Common Core Standards Implementation, needs of English Learners, 
cooperative learning, and professional collaboration.  Teachers, resource staff, instructi
onal aides and office staff have 
opportunities to attend professional development trainings provided by the MCOE and statewide programs. 
Administrators participate as well with PLC, Dr. DeWitt administrative coaching, MTSS, and other district
-
wide focused 
trainings.    Each new teacher also receives assistance and support from our New Teacher Support Coordinator and New 
Teacher TOSA. Teachers collaborate with grade level teams on a weekly basis through PLC allotted time and meet regularly 
with the principal
 
for ongoing professional development support. Each trimester, we meet to review data in data analysis 
sessions where the focus is on data to drive
-
instruction and data to move teaching practices forward.
