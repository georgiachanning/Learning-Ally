About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card 
(SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan
 
(LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For m
ore information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF w
eb 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Nelson Elementary provides a clean and safe learning environment. Students, staff and parents take pride in the upkeep of the
 
campus and its buildings. 
Students report vandalism and help support efforts to maintain a
 
clean campus. Our custodial staff consists of one daytime custodian and two evening 
custodians. Our two full
-
time and one half
-
time custodians perform basic cleaning operations daily and maintain the grounds and buildings. Grounds 
crews from the district 
provide weekly landscaping and outside maintenance support. In addition, we conduct deep cleaning twice a year at each site. 
Our SART committee conducts eight clean
-
campus inspections each year. This committee of parents inspects the campus grounds and res
trooms on a 
regular basis to provide feedback to our student body. Through increased community awareness, pride and an open
-
campus policy, we hope to keep 
vandalism and burglary to an all
-
time low.
 
 
There are 20 permanent classrooms on five separate wings 
located on the Nelson campus. In addition, there are four portable classrooms: three 

 
an administration 
office, Library Media Cente
r and computer lab, teacher workroom, multipurpose building, kindergarten building, conference room and snack
-
bar facility.
 
 
As a result of bond measures passed over the last decade, Nelson Elementary has benefitted from classroom modernizations, upd
ated t
he HVAC system 
to a more efficient one, upgraded internet wiring and ports, replaced the cafeteria flooring, brought the facility to be curr
ent with the most recent 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance requirements, added new paint and trim on 
building exteriors, upgraded the boiler, replaced security 
cameras with high
-
definition versions, laid new carpet in classrooms and office, and improved drainage on campus. Additionally, the site was pa
rt of the 
district
-
wide solar project to install panel
s on campus during the 2012
-
13 school year. In 2017
-
18, the school blacktop was given a slurry coat and the 
playing courts repainted. Modernization of the landscaping around campus continued throughout the school year.
 
 
The district believes schools are th
e hub of their neighborhoods. As a result, a high priority is placed on building and maintaining excellent facilities as 
economically as possible. The school facilities are made available to community groups for a variety of uses, and these recip
rocal rela
tionships strengthen 
community and school.

School 
Safety Plan
 
Nelson has a school safety plan along with a School Crisis Intervention Plan on file; both are available to all parents as we
ll as the general public. Staff 
and parents review and update the school plans annually. Safety procedures were updated
 
and reviewed with the staff in September 2019, and the final 
plan for the school year will be reviewed and shared with all staff in December 2019, after approval by the School Site Counc
il. The staff developed safety 
procedures and the school safety plan 
with input from parents and community members to ensure a safe and nonviolent environment. The school plan 
features specific areas of focus, coupled with appropriate strategies to address concerns.
 
 
Each month, staff and students participate in fire, earth
quake and evacuation drills as part of the safety plan for preparedness. Staff has also trained with 
district, Clovis and Fresno police departments in safety matters. The school actively promotes a safe environment using the C
haracter Counts program 
and an
ti
-
bullying strategies. Teachers refer students and parents to support groups facilitated by the school psychologist and trained
 
teachers in the 
CUSD Support & Intervention program. Groups are based on student need and include grief
-
support groups and ange
r
-
management groups. The six
-
week sessions provide students with a safe place to share their feelings, needs and frustrations and receive positive coachin
g and coping strategies from 
a trained facilitator. Students needing further intervention are referred
 
to the school psychologist. Our students are also supported through counseling 
services provided on
-
campus by Fresno County Mental Health Services and Fresno County Comprehensive Youth Services.
 
 
An instructional aide trained in social
-
emotional learning 
uses Second Step curriculum to support our students. The Transition Program (SOAR), resulting 
from the LCAP process with parent input, provides support in navigating the education institution and helps struggling studen
ts build academic behaviors 
needed fo
r their success. Teachers have access to executive functioning skills and SEL curriculum through PureEdge.org. Staff training
 
in Trauma
-
Informed 
Schools and Trust
-
Based Relational Intervention continues monthly as we build greater understanding and relatio
nships between staff, students and 
families.
 
 
Staff, administration and campus monitors provide supervision during recesses and before
-
 
and after
-
school periods at Nelson Elementary. The number 
of adults on duty exceeds the state requirements. Suspension a
nd expulsion procedures comply with District Board policy and state Education Code. 
Students are provided with retraining prior to a suspension and upon return to school after a suspension.

The Nelson staff remains current in the field of education 
through the professional learning community (PLC) process and the opportunity to attend 
conferences, workshops, in
-
services and staff development. Professional development is ongoing to ensure teachers keep abreast of newlearning 
strategies, innovative tea
ching techniques and applied technology in the field of education. Nelson staff currently partners with Curriculum Services a
nd 
Innovation to provide staff development activities focusing on a math series pilot in Grade 4. Teachers in grade 6 have worke
d c
losely with a math 
curriculum specialist while implementing a newmath series, Illustrative Math. All grade 1
-
5 staff are training in the newELA series, Benchmark. Site 
Administration provides staff development through workshops by the district, and site
-
sp
ecific topics are addressed in monthly in
-
services, on early 
release Wednesdays and supported by our full
-
time resource teacher, Mrs. Jennie Mau. Over the past five years, Nelson Elementary teachers and staff 
have been trained in English language developme
nt (ELD) and daily vocabulary development (Kinsella), effective feedback (Hattie), Close Reading and 
collaborative Writing processes (Fisher), and developing Growth Mindset (Dweck). Beginning in the fall of 2017, the Clovis we
st area, including Nelson 
Elem
entary, began training with the Kagan group to enhance student engagement through interactive, structured and collaborative a
pproaches to 
learning. Most recently, the staff has been training in Social
-
Emotional Learning and Trauma Informed School practices
. The PLC pro cess measures 
teaching effectiveness on a biweekly basis. We use student progress, as measured by comparison of pre
-
 
and post
-
assessments on specific skills and 
standards, to guide planning, teaching strategies and staff development.
 
 
The dis
trict focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery lea
rning, multi
-
tiered system 
of supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevan
t understanding. In the 2018
-
19 school year, 
the district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional develop
ment opportunities on staff 
development days, substitute release days, and on early re
lease days. A variety of after
-
school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.
 
One hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty
-
five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching 
through the CUSD Induc
tion program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site
-
based training and district sponsored training that included:  
curriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi
-
tiered systems of support, and culturally
 
relevant instructional practices.

Types of Services Funded
 

 
On an annual basis, Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) submits the Application for Funding Consolidated 
Application and Reporting System for 
Categorical Aid Programs commonly called CARS. The application is submitted in two (2) parts:  Part I, which contains program
 
and demographic 
information, is submitted by June 1 each year; and Part II, which contains th
e budget information and additional program data, is submitted by January 
31 each year.  The categorical programs included in the application are Title I, Part A 

 
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged 
Improving, Title I, Part C

students in
 
mastering state 
standards.
 
 
Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community.  CU
SD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive differences in the lives of the child

education will not only bring success to your child but other children in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in
 
the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud
 
to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending on the type of categorica
l 
funding a site may receive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and gui
del
ines.  Such advisory 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee (DAC) and School Advisory Committee (SAC)

School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) describes the school

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each and every student.  Parental involvement is a nece
ssary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall p

Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP).  If you would like additional information on any of the District Parent Councils or Commi
ttees, please ca

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical
 
programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
ts, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing an
d evaluating the 
School P
lan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.

District Advisory Committee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves
 
as an a
dvisory committee 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs 
are supplemental education opportunities that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  The SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to function
 
as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are required to form an ELAC. T
he ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommen
dations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding services for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the 
district, there shall be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a DELAC representative and arra
nge to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC by
laws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/guardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) e
lected to serve as the DELAC 
representative by the si

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meets four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achiev
ement of our students, community agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan Native students in grades
 
K 
-
 
12. The program 
assists eligible students to achieve at the same challenging sta
te performance standards expected of all students in grades pre
-
K

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP annually that works to better align the academic plan
 
with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our
 
CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participation of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, D
istrict Meetings and 
Commun
ity Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share their 
ideas on how CUSD 
can provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in
 


 
 

uth and families and to 
provide inpu
t and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to share new ideas
 
to support 
identified groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical 

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 

l characteristics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economically disadvantaged ho
mes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because the
y have a primary language other than English.  Children, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally provided through the base/core curriculum program.
  
The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental 
services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Categorical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support to meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of 
high quality learning opportunities and access to the core curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additional assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom pro
gram (base/core curriculum) 
and address any
 
learning gaps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff development.   Staf
f development 
activities are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other 
staff to challenge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
