By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Del Sur Elementary School opened in August of 2008. We are now entering our eleventh year. During this time, we 
continue to build a school of excellence. Our school has gained the lofty position of achieving a 10 10 state wide ranki
ng 
consistently when rankings were used to measure school performance based on standardized testing across the nation. 
We also were given the recognition of a 2014 California Distinguished School and a 2014 National Blue Ribbon School. Our 
school is built 
on the notion of educating children for the world of the 21st century.
 
 
Our balanced and rigorous program provides instruction in all content areas including the arts and physical education. 
Learning opportunities foster curiosity and academic achievement 
through a standards
-
based curriculum that promotes 
inquiry and discovery. This will yield well
-
rounded, college ready students that are self
-
disciplined thinkers. On our campus 
every classroom is affiliated with a university. The universities represented o
n our campus include 
-
 
Northern Arizona 
University, Alabama, the University of Pennsylvania, Indiana, Oklahoma, Pittsburgh, Linfield College, California, UCSD, San 
Diego State, California State University, William and Mary, San Marcos, Cal Poly, Oregon,
 
Oh
io State, Hawaii, USC, 
Michigan, Washington,Yale, UC Santa Cruz, Point Loma, Pacific, Auburn, Baylor, Georgia, 
 
Kansas, UCSB, and
 
UCLA.
 
 
Teachers and support staff are committed to social and academic excellence and work together in a cooperative, 
supporti
ve, and professional manner. The school staff continually seeks new ways to provide sustained, effective, and 
quality instruction that meets the needs of all students.
 
 
Del Sur is located 30 miles north of downtown San Diego in the community of Del Sur. Ou
r student body consists of 
students from richly diverse cultural, ethnic, linguistic, and religious backgrounds. In ethnic terms, the greatest number of
 
our students are Caucasian (53%). Our second highest number of students are Asian (19%).
 
Fifteen percen
t of our students 
have limited English proficiency.
 
Eleven percent of our students come from educationally disadvantaged homes.
 
 
Del Sur will be a progressive school dedicated to providing high levels of learning for all students while being focused on 
the
ir academic and social emotional development.
 
 
We want our Explorers to be problem solvers and thinkers in an ever changing world.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Poway 
Unified School District ensures that students attend clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each of its 
schools is maintained in good repair.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained
.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and well maintained.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A night custodial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms and offices daily.  
The district has adopted cleaning standards for all sch
ools.  A summary of these standards is available at the district offices.

Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which

ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
During the course of the year, our parents have many opportunities to get involved with our school. We have a very active 
Parent Teacher Association (PTA) and a highly supportive Foundation. Our PTA organization sponsors many programs that 
bring parents to
 
school. For example, on a yearly basis this organization
 
sponsors a Back to School Picnic before 
school,the
 
annual Halloween parade, Literacy Night, Character Counts week activities, a fall and spring Book Fair, Math 
Family Night, Science Family Night, a 
science fair, Heritage Night, and Science Career Day. Our Educational Foundation 
was formed to help our school
 
fundraise for programs needed on the campus. This important school organization provides 
our school support in the following programs: Impact Tea
chers for RTI Tier two student support, technology procurements, 
physical education
 
teacher, art teacher, music teacher, and After School Clubs lead by Del Sur teachers. This group also 
brings various technology supports to our school such as chromebook ca
rts and various software resources like 
Accelerated Reader, Brain Pop, Spelling City, Mountain Language, Lexia, Raz
-
Kids, and ELD software resources. Our School 
Site Council which is composed of teachers, staff, parents, and the administrator collectively
 
write and review
 
our yearly 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement document and also write and review our yearly parent and student surveys. Three 
times a year, our EL parents attend meetings with our staff to learn important information on how to support the
ir 
students. We invite our parents of our GATE students to two meetings a year.
 
 
 
Every other Friday, parents are invited to our Friday Flag assembly where we celebrate our country and students and 
discuss upcoming events. To prepare students for a success
ful school experience, a parent participation preschool and a 
regular full day preschool program
 
is provided on our site. We also have one Critical Skills Preschool program on our site 
to meet the needs of our students in our community and throughout the d
istrict. At Del Sur parent involvement and input 
is highly sought after and valued.
