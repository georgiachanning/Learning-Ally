By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
As part of the  Local Control Funding Formula, school districts are required to develop, adopt, and annually update a 
three
-
year Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP).  The LCAP is a comprehensive plan showing how school districts support 
student success.  The plan is organized around state and local priorities.  Center Joint Unified School District has created 
goals t
o meet the LCAP requirements.  The first goal is:  CJUSD students will be challenged and supported to achieve 
academic success in a clean, safe environment.  At Spinelli, we teach the Common Core State Standards, use district 
adopted curriculum, participat
e in staff development and collaboration to improve student learning, and ensure EL 
students get additional support where needed.  To reach our goals, we provide a morning intervention program five days 
a week with two credentialed teachers, and we offer a
dditional support throughout the school day by pushing
-
in and 
pulling
-
out students with one full
-
time and one half
-
time credentialed teacher.  The second goal:  CJUSD students will be 
engaged in their educational process and opportunities.  We offer incent
ives to remedy attendance issues by encouraging 
students to participate in after school extra curricular activities.  The third goal:  CJUSD families will be engaged and 
informed regarding their students' educational experience.  We offer several opportuni
ties during the school year for our 
families to participate in day and evening educational events.  We communicate with families via email, auto
-
dialer 
messages, phone calls home, personal parent meetings, written communication, and internet access to stud
ent grades 
via Homelink.

2017 school year aligned with the Common Core State Standards.  All professional development for the past three 
years  has been  focus
ed on the Common Core State Standards with the  new Math and ELA programs.  Teachers attended 
multiple day long training sessions, and several early out days were focused on the Common Core State Standards and 
curriculum implementation  for Math and ELA . 
 
There was also a focus on the writing text types:  narrative, 
informational/explanatory, and opinion/argument.  Rubrics were implemented for the different text types, and exemplars 
were selected at each grade level. Staff were trained on calibrating the r
ubrics in order to have cohesive program.    
Benchmark data in Math and Language Arts was recorded district
-
wide in grades K

spent reviewing and discussing student work samples, and sharing and implementing teaching strate
gies to improve 
student learning opportunities.    The district and site administrators continue to participate in the curriculum trainings 
and meetings so they can better support the teachers.  Teachers have the opportunity to observe other teachers 
class
rooms to observe quality teaching and learning in action.  Site funds are used to provide Professional Development 
from SCOE to maximize our Wonders curriculum.
