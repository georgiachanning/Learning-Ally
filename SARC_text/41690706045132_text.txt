School Description
 
Skyline Elementary School has hardworking and fun
-
loving students, dedicated teachers, and 
supportive parents. We view Skyline School as a place of work (but we also have fun) and each child 
as a unique person with individual gifts, interests, and talents.
 
The curricula and instructional 
strategies are designed to foster a community of lifelong learners. The teaching staff, through the 
support of our Instructional Leadership Team, is continually improving techniques to encourage 
optimum intellectual, social
, emotional, and physical growth for every child. All students have equal 
access to the curriculum and equal opportunities for success. Every classroom has multiple 
computers and the school has 2 laptop carts (and soon to have 3) that are continually used,
 
as well 
other technologies, which are integrated into curricular areas. The Skyline staff continually 
participates in staff development. Every child is encouraged to be competent and self
-
reliant. 
Students are provided a learning environment that enhances
 
positive feelings of self
-
esteem.
 
 
We provide additional structured activities like noon time sports tournaments and after
-
school 
programs like reading intervention, math club, book club, art, garden club and the bricks for kidz 
lego engineering club, edi
ble arts, chess, and others. There is an RTI teacher for additional support 
for teachers and students.
 
 
We are proud of the diversity of cultures and languages at Skyline School. Students, staff, parents, 
and community members all feel part of the Skyline 
School Family. Our school is a great place to 
be! We are very proud to have been awarded the California Distinguished award in May of 2010. 
Our school was awarded Distinguished School for 2014 as well.
 
 
As part of our continual improvement process we 
are updating the school mission statement, and 
creating student learning expectations. Our motto is "At Skyline We Grow Readers and Leaders!"
 
 
The mission of Skyline School is to promote the embodiment of our student learning expectations
-
 
Skyline Students
 
are: Committed, Academic Learners; Active, responsible citizens; and Creative 
Thinkers/Problem Solvers.

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned
 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Skyline Elementary School was built in 1966. The school has 21 teaching stations (6 buildings, 3 portables, MUR, Library, Res
ource Center and 
Administration Offices) providing education for grades K
-
5. The District takes great effort to ensure that all sch
ools are clean, safe and functional. All 
bathrooms, classrooms and offices are cleaned daily. District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep th
e school in good repair and 
working order are completed in a timely manner. The facilities
 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority. Our walking path around the perimeter of the grassy area on the recess yard was replaced in Novem
ber 2019.

Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

(School Year 2019

We have multiple opportunities for parental involvement at Skyline. Our PTA is very active in supporting the school through v
arious fundraisers, book 
fairs, family movie nights, spirit wear, and daily volunteering on campus. We encourage parents to volunte

playground. Skyline School has held International Night for the past 5 years, a very popular event, that doubles as a communi
ty builder and fund raiser! 
We believe that parental involvement leads to overall student s

the school office to identify opportunities for volunteering on campus. All parent volunteers are expected to sign in at the 
office and uphold the rules 
and expectati
ons of Skyline School while on campus. Please remember to complete volunteer paperwork!

all evacuation locations, paths of travel and utility shut off locations. All staff are broken up into teams so that all area
s are covered
 
and 
release/reunification procedures run smoothly. There is also a staff release plan in the event there is a need to house stude
nts overnight. Staff has also 
been trained in CPR, First Aid, Fire Suppression as well  as Search & Rescue techniques.

support. We enlist the knowledge of experts and strat
egize on how to best accelerate the growth of our students.

We are actively engaging in ongoing professional development with the new standards. We utilize experts 
from the San Mateo County Office of Education to give us the mo
st up to date information on the implementation of the Common Core 
Standards.
 

 
Soul Shoppe

Our staff has been through a training with the Soul Shoppe program to allow for common language in character education. The 
program also is providing 3 assemblies fo
cusing on teaching tools for resolving conflict and how to handle bullying in a healthy way. We are 
also using PAX Good Behavior Game and it has been very successful in helping students to self regulate their behavior in scho
ol.

e PLC process and the Data Analysis Protocol, by grade level, as a staff, in order to better support student learning.
