About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The parents and the community are very supportive of the educational programs in the South San Francisco Unified School Distr
ict. The Parent Teacher 
Association (PTA) plays an active role in the community and at school site through fundraising and involvem
ent in special activities. PTA fundraising 
enables students to attend field trips, assemblies and has supported the purchase of classroom equipment and supplies. Our PT
A is very dedicated to 
helping the students of our school. Junipero Serra's PTA sponsors
 
a variety of events throughout the year including: Larry Itliong Day, Halloween 
Happening, Wacky Water Walk, Winter Crafts Workshop, Welcome Back for Families, Family Nights, a Talent Show, and end

of

PTA contributes significant fin
ancial support to our 5th Grade Outdoor Education and the Art

regularly scheduled meetings the third Thursday of each month and welcomes all parents to attend. We believe that our school
