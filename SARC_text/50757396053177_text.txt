School Description
 
The mission of Julien Elementary School is to ensure ALL STUDENTS develop a strong academic 
foundation and essential social skills to become responsible citizens. Julien Elementary School was 
established in 1954 and named after Eric Julien and Albert Julien, two brothers who were 
prominent doctors in Turlock in the 1950s.  Julien Elementary Schoo
l is a Professional Learning 
Community that strives to ensure academic and social excellence for all of our students.  We 
accomplish this through effective instruction of essential standards within every classroom, 
frequent and ongoing assessments, and reg
ular collaboration by our grade level teams.  
Collaborative teams meet regularly to identify essential standards and skills, create common 
formative assessments, analyze data, and develop interventions and enrichments based upon 

sentials standards. We provide an outstanding educational environment 
through positive behavior supports that encourage strong character traits and citizenship.  We also 
focus upon 21st Century learning and educational technology within our instruction, an
d provide 
the resources and skills for our students to be successful in their academic futures and careers.  We 
have a variety of activities that students participate in which highlight College and Career Readiness 
(e.g. Lego Robotics, Math Blast, Science 
Olympiad, School Garden, Spelling Bee, Walk
-
through 
History, NGSS, Engineering and Design, and weekly visits to the science lab).  We continue to focus 
upon our school theme, Engineering and Design, where students are taught the Engineering and 
Design proc

population is 806 students.  We offer Transitional Kindergarten

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which de
scribes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.
