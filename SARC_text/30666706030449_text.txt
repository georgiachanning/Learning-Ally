About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Maintenance and Operations (M & O) employs an electronic work order system

School Dude 
-
 
enabling school staff to communicate unscheduled 
maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or s

qualified, professional trade specialists. Emergency situations are immediately resolved either by the school custodian or di
strict maintenance st
aff, 
based upon the nature of the situation. Day and evening custodians work closely as a team and with the principal for routine 
maintenance, daily custodial 
duties, and special events preparations. The principal and day custodian communicate daily to dis
cuss campus cleaning needs and safety concerns. Every 
morning before school begins, the plant custodian and principal (or TOSA) inspect facilities for safety hazards, graffiti, an
d other conditions that require 
removal prior to students and staff entering 


f chemicals, and use of 
equipment. The day custodians are responsible for following an established set of cleaning standards and prioritization proce
dures for general campus 
maintenance. The day custodian checks restrooms twice a day as a proactive measure in keeping facilities w
ell
-
stocked, safe, and sanitary. The evening 
custodians are responsible for the thorough cleaning of classrooms, office areas, and restrooms. Groundskeepers
 
are dispatched by the district office to perform general maintenance of landscaping, gardening, spo
rts fields, and irrigation systems. In the summers and 
extended holiday periods, custodial teams address detail areas, including shampooing carpets, deep cleaning of whiteboards an
d surface areas, steam
-
cleaning chairs, and safety inspections of the campus
 
and surrounding areas.

Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System
, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and gr
ade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive
 
disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or

Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
-
Note: Double dashes (

) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is
 
too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
-
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is 
not the number that w
as used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using only students 
who received scores.

In the 2017
-
18 school year, Wilson Elementary focused on Mathematics professional development.  All teachers attended training to impleme
nt the 
recently
-
adopted Houghton
-
Mifflin Math Expressions curriculum (4 full 
days) and supplemental Irvine Math Project lessons (12 full days 
-
 
2 per grade 
level).  Grades K 
-
 
3 teachers received professional development on SIPPS to use as replacement for the phonics component of Open Court Reading, 
district
-
adopted ELA curriculum 
(2 full days).  All teachers received professional development in writing, three times during the year (6 partial days).
 
 
In 2018
-
19, Wilson teachers received professional development in two key areas:  1) mathematics 
-
 
Irvine Math Project training (6 full
 
days)  and  2) 
implementation of Benchmark Advance, newly adopted ELA/ELD curriculum for grades K 
-
 
5 (8 full days).  Mathematics was selected as an area of 
professional growth by the Instructional Leadership based on multiple measures data analysis: 2017
/18 CAASPP SBAC Math, MAP math and District 
benchmark assessments' results.  Grade
-
level teams participated in 2 three
-
hour professional conversations sessions, following Fall and Winter 
administrations of the MAP Math assessment (6 partial days).   All st
aff received training on school safety and emergency procedures (1 full day).  Activity 
Monitors received 5 training sessions on the following topics: team building strategies, student mediation and problem
-
solve, communication with 
students, communication
 
with parents and student engagement (1 full day).
 
 
For the current school year, 2019/20, prior to the first day of instruction, all staff received training on school safety and
 
emergency procedures (1 partial 
day).  In addition, all teachers districtwide 
were required to participate in MTSS professional development (1 partial day).   For 2019/20, the school has 
identified Mathematics as a major area for professional growth and development.   All teachers are required to participate in
 
Benchmark Advance ELD
 
training to implement both, integrated and designated ELD instruction, daily.   Teachers will receive training and coaching o
n the new components of ST 
Math (1 partial day), Irvine Math Project (8 partial days), and the use of student mathematical discour
se to explain their reasoning and develop problem
-
solving skills.   As indicated by data collected from various 2018/19 District and State assessments, last year Wilson made s
ignificant growth in 
mathematics (compared to the prior year, 2017/18); however, 
overall math scores continue to be lower than overall reading scores across all grade
-
levels.  Teachers will participate in professional conversations sessions with the principal two times for an hour, to analyz
e students/class math data, 
determine progres
s, and plan differentiated instruction, based on student needs (4 partial days).  At the beginning of the year teachers in gr
ades K
-
 
3 
were required to attend DIBELS 8th Edition training.  DIBELS 8th Edition (most recent edition) is used districtwide to as
sess and monitor students' progress 
in reading (K 
-
 
3) (2 partial days).  As indicated in the 2019/20 School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA), teachers in grades 4 and 5 will
 
complete AVID 
Essentials training to support students with research
-
based stra
tegies to develop 21st Century skills and prepare them for college and careers (4 full 
days).
