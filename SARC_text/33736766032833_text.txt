School Description
 
This is an exciting time for our staff 
and students at John Kelley Elementary School. Our students 
are meeting the challenge of our state standards and we are all very proud of their 


ef is apparent as everyone continues to work diligently to attain academic goals. 
Continuing our success will encompass targeting learning strategies to students with a specific 
focus on Writing, Math and ELD; continuing in our Response to Interventions (R
TI); updating 
technology to address RTI; increasing community and parent involvement; and updating facilities 
to provide a safe environment for all.
 
 
We continue to have very active parents who serve on our School Site Council, English Language 
Advisory Co
uncil (ELAC), and Parent, Teacher Organization (PTO). These groups, staff and I will work 
towards welcoming parents and community members to assist teachers in helping students attain 
proficiency in English/Language Arts and Mathematics Standards. This yea
r we are continuing the 
implementation of AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) in grades Three through Six 
and implementing Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS) for all grades.
 
 
Teachers work regularly in Data Team Meetings and p
articipate in Professional Development with 
a focus in Writing, Math and English Language Development (ELD). They analyze data, target 
student needs and discuss teaching modifications to meet their needs. Through this process, 
learning strategies for stude
nts are discussed and shared, along with teaching strategies.
 
 
We believe that our students are willing to learn and our staff and parents are willing to support 
the vision. The power of this belief is why John Kelley Blazers will continue to succeed.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical
