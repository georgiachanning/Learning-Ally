Description
 
and
 
Mission
 
Statement
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
At
 
PHE,
 
we
 
are
 
a
 
community
 
of
 
learners
 
who
 
work
 
collaboratively
 
and
 
embrace
 
new
 
ideas.
  
Our
 
school
 
is
 
strategically
 
designed
 
to
 
create
 
environments
 
which
 
build
 
a
 
strong
 
foundation
 
in
 
both
 
academics
 
and
 
social
 
responsibility.
  
Each
 
student
 
is
 
provided
 
opportunities
 
to
 
develop
 
critical
 
thinking
 
skills
 
and
 
apply
 
knowledge
 
in
 
innovative
 
ways.
 
 
PHE
 
provides
 
a
 
rich
 
academic
 
learning
 
environment
 
that
 
aims
 
to
 
set
 
a
 
strong
 
foundation
 
in
 
our
 
core
 
academic
 
areas
 
of
 
Reading,
 
Writing,
 
Mathematics,
 
Science,
 
and
 
Social
 
Studies.
  
Teachers
 
utilize
 
research-based,
 
effective
 
instructional
 
strategies
 
to
 
develop
 
21st
 
century
 
skills
 
such
 
as:
 
communication,
 
creativity,
 
critical
 
thinking,
 
student
 
collaboration,
 
and
 
integration
 
of
 
technology.
  
Our
 
students
 
also
 
are
 
provided
 
with
 
a
 
well-rounded
 
education
 
through
 
our
 
strong
 
Vocal
 
Music,
 
Instrumental
 
Music,
 
and
 
Art,
 
Library,
 
and
 
Technology/Engineering.
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
receiving
 
support
 
within
 
the
 
classroom,
 
PHE
 
offers
 
students
 
opportunities
 
to
 
increase
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
apply
 
their
 
learning
 
in
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
learning
 
environments
 
through
 
our
 
computer,
 
STEAM
 
(Science
 
Technology
 
Engineering
 
Art
 
and
 
Science),
 
and
 
Garden
 
Labs!
 
 
PHE
 
promotes
 
school-wide
 
Positive
 
Behavioral
 
Interventions
 
and
 
Support
 
(PBIS)
 
which
 
focus
 
on
 
guiding
 
student
 
behavior
 
in
 
constructive,
 
positive
 
ways.
  
PBIS
 
is
 
a
 
philosophy
 
that
 
uses
 
positive
 
behavior
 
support
 
to
 
address
 
behavior
 
by
 
systematically
 
and
 
consistently
 
acknowledging
 
and
 
reinforcing
 
positive
 
student
 
and
 
staff
 
behavior.
 
School-wide
 
rules,
 
procedures,
 
and
 
expectations
 
are
 
taught
 
regularly
 
and
 
consistently
 
throughout
 
the
 
school
 
year.
 
Discipline
 
is
 
seen,
 
not
 
as
 
a
 
punishment,
 
but
 
as
 
an
 
opportunity
 
for
 
staff
 
and
 
parents
 
to
 
partner
 
to
 
provide
 
students
 
with
 
instruction
 
in
 
making
 
good
 
choices
 
and
 
restorative
 
consequences
 
for
 
individual
 
actions.
  
Data
 
is
 
used
 
to
 
regularly
 
create
 
focused
 
behavioral
 
interventions
 
to
 
help
 
students
 
succeed
 
academically,
 
socially,
 
and
 
emotionally.
  
The
 
PTA
 
has
 
taken
 
a
 
lead
 
role
 
in
 
funding
 
our
 
student
 
store
 
which
 
is
 
the
 
cornerstone
 
of
 
providing
 
incentives
 
and
 
rewards
 
to
 
students
 
who
 
demonstrate
 
good
 
character.

Safety
 
Plan
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
Pleasant
 
Hill
 
Elementary
 
updates
 
its
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
annually,
 
in
 
collaboration
 
with
 
the
 
School
 
Site
 
Council
 
and
 
School
 
Safety
 
Committee.
 
Once
 
the
 
plan
 
is
 
completed,
 
it
 
is
 
sent
 
to
 
the
 
Mt.
 
Diablo
 
Unified
 
School
 
District
 
School
 
Board
 
for
 
approval.
 
The
 
last
 
plan
 
was
 
adopted
 
on
 
2/21/2019
 
by
 
the
 
School
 
Site
 
Council
 
at
 
a
 
public
 
hearing
 
which
 
discussed
 
and
 
reviewed
 
attendance
 
data,
 
discipline
 
data,
 
and
 
safety
 
concerns.
 
 
Teachers
 
and
 
administrative
 
staff
 
all
 
play
 
an
 
integral
 
role
 
in
 
the
 
safety
 
plan,
 
providing
 
communication
 
to
 
all
 
constituents
 
community
 
wide.
 
The
 
safety
 
plan
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
support
 
all
 
types
 
of
 
emergency
 
situations
 
and
 
the
 
necessary
 
protocol
 
for
 
evacuation.
 
The
 
school
 
uses
 
this
 
plan
 
as
 
a
 
guideline
 
when
 
participating
 
in
 
emergency
 
drills
 
to
 
ensure
 
staff
 
and
 
students
 
are
 
familiar
 
with
 
the
 
necessary
 
protocols
 
to
 
effectively
 
respond
 
to
 
these
 
emergencies.
 
Some
 
of
 
the
 
drills
 
include:
 
fire,
 
earthquake,
 
natural
 
disaster,
 
and
 
intruder
 
drills.
 
These
 
drills
 
are
 
all
 
timed
 
and
 
logged
 
for
 
informational
 
purposes.

The
 
focus
 
of
 
training
 
during
 
the
 
2018-2019
 
school
 
year,
 
was
 
on
 
analyzing
 
student
 
writing,
 
math,
 
and
 
introducing
 
AVID
 
(Advancement
 
via
 
Individual
 
Determination).
 
Teachers
 
received
 
three
 
half-day
 
installments
 
on
 
how
 
to
 
incorporate
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
different
 
strategies
 
into
 
instruction.
 
On
 
early
 
release
 
Wednesdays,
 
Pleasant
 
Hill
 
Elementary
 
continued
 
to
 
expand
 
upon
 
the
 
district
 
PD
 
by
 
providing
 
onsite
 
professional
 
development
 
that
 
allowed
 
teachers
 
to
 
collaborate
 
as
 
they
 
reviewed
 
student
 
work
 
samples
 
and
 
data.
 
Instructional
 
Rounds
 
was
 
used
 
as
 
a
 
learning
 
tool
 
to
 
view
 
instruction
 
and
 
learning
 
in
 
action
 
which
 
supports
 
student
 
learning
 
by
 
aligning
 
practices
 
from
 
TK
 
through
 
5th
 
grade.
  
Teachers
 
also
 
embarked
 
on
 
an
 
exploration
 
of
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
different
 
instructional
 
strategies
 
as
 
they
 
sought
 
ways
 
to
 
help
 
students
 
better
 
engage
 
and
 
take
 
ownership
 
of
 
their
 
learning
 
throughout
 
the
 
year.
  
In
 
June,
 
a
 
cohort
 
of
 
teachers
 
attended
 
a
 
three
 
day
 
workshop
 
to
 
receive
 
training
 
and
 
develop
 
a
 
plan
 
to
 
rollout
 
AVID
 
school-wide
 
for
 
the
 
2019-2020
 
school
 
year.
 
 
During
 
the
 
2018-2019
 
school
 
year
 
is
 
on
 
deepening
 
our
 
educator's
 
ability
 
to
 
prioritize,
 
plan
 
instruction,
 
and
 
analyze
 
assessments
 
in
 
the
 
California
 
content
 
standards
 
in
 
both
 
English-language
 
Arts
 
and
 
Math.
 
Teachers
 
received
 
training
 
on
 
our
 
district-identified
 
priority
 
standards
 
and
 
were
 
provided
 
time
 
to
 
dive
 
deeply
 
into
 
the
 
how
 
these
 
standards
 
might
 
be
 
addressed
 
using
 
our
 
curriculum
 
and
 
resources.
  
On
 
early
 
release
 
Wednesdays,
 
Pleasant
 
Hill
 
Elementary
 
expanded
 
on
 
this
 
effort
 
by
 
providing
 
onsite
 
professional

which
 
provided
 
opportunities
 
for

teams
 
to
 
receive
 
support
 
from
 
the
 
district
 
Teacher
 
on
 
Special

(TOSA).
 
Another
 
area
 
of
 
continued
 
focus
 
was
 
in
 
analyzing
 
student
 
work
 
and
 
assessments
 
to
 
determine
 
how
 
to
 
best
 
intervene
 
and
 
support
 
student
 
learning
 
in
 
their
 
Professional
 
Learning
 
Communities
 
(PLC).
 
 
During
 
the
 
2017-2018
 
school
 
year,
 
our
 
focus
 
was
 
on
 
enhancing
 
teacher
 
pedagogy
 
in
 
English-language
 
Arts
 
and
 
Math.
 
Teachers
 
received
 
three
 
half-day
 
installments
 
on
 
how
 
to
 
use
 
new
 
curriculum
 
and
 
new
 
instructional
 
strategies
 
designed
 
to
 
improve
 
student
 
learning.
 
On
 
early
 
release
 
Wednesdays,
 
Pleasant
 
Hill
 
Elementary
  
expanded
 
on
 
this
 
effort
 
by
 
providing
 
onsite
 
professional
 
development
 
where
 
teachers
 
learned
 
about
 
restorative
 
practices
 
and
 
additional
 
methods
 
to
 
shift
 
their
 
instruction
 
to
 
a
 
more
 
student-centered
 
model.
 
Another
 
area
 
of
 
focusof
 
the
 
year
 
was
 
in
 
teacher
 
collaboration
 
with
 
the
 
aim
 
of
 
student
 
improvement.
  
To
 
support
 
this
 
effort,
 
all
 
teachers
 
received
 
several
 
sessions
 
of
 
Professional
 
Learning
 
Communities
 
(PLC)
 
training
 
where
 
they
 
reviewed
 
student
 
data
 
and
 
shared
 
instructional

Both
 
teachers
