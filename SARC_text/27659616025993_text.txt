School Description
 
Fremont Elementary is one of 12 schools in the Alisal Union School District. Fremont serves over 
close to 900 students from Transitional Kindergarten through sixth grade. Our enrollment includes 
two Life Skills, 
Special Education classes. In addition, we have one Resource Specialist Program 
(RSP), which includes RSP teacher and aide, Speech Therapist, one part
-
time psychologist, one full
-
time counselor with the Whole
-
Child Division Counseling Program, and a part t
ime Sticks and 
Stones counselor. We continue to house two Head Start programs, one district preschool, and two 
Monterey County (MCOE) special education classes. Please note that students in early learning, and 
MCOE programs are not included in the reported
 
number of students enrolled at Fremont School. 
Currently, the school consists of 34 self
-
contained classrooms. The school was build in the early 
1940's and as such, the grounds and infrastructure continue to be transformed into a modern 
learning environme
nt and a significant resource for the community. Most recently a 2
-
story 
building was constructed that contains 16 classrooms. On going, by phase, construction will 
continue to take place for a full modernization of our school. Each classroom  is equipped 
with 
projection systems and Document Cameras. Each classroom also has desktop computers for 
student access and a laptop for teacher use including color printers in some classrooms. All students 
have 1:1 access to devices (Chrome books).
 
 
Mission:
 
 
Fremont 
Elementary is a collaborative community of lifelong learners that believes that EVERY child 
is able to learn;  where learning is a fundamental human right and as such, every student deserves 
an equal and equitable learning opportunity to receive access to 
high
-
quality education regardless 
of disability, cultural background, socioeconomic status, or gender.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains infor
mation about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how th
ey intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Classroom space at our school is adequate to support our school's current 
enrollment. The District maintains a planned program, which ensures routine 
maintenance functions are performed on a scheduled basis. Custodial staff performs basic cleaning operations daily. A locked 
fence surrounds our 
campus, and  ensures the safety of 
our students at all times. Visitors to our campus must check in at the front office and wear a visitor badge for easy 
identification of strangers on campus. Fremont maintains sufficient space for effective classroom instruction for students an
d teachers as
 
well as safe, 
play structures for all students to enjoy. Our site falls under the William's Settlement. Each year our school site is monito
red to ensure all facilities are in 
safe and working order.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Research shows a high correlation between parent involvement and effective schools. At Fremont Elementary, we recognize and v
alue the importance 
of parent involvement. In creating and sustaining a thriving learning environment
 
for all students, we encourage parents to visit and partner with our 
school. Fremont has an active Parent
-
Teacher Organization (PTO), which sponsors many projects for the benefit and welfare of our students. Parents are 
also encouraged  to participate in 
school and district staff development activities, including active participation and membership of our School Site Council 
(SSC), District English Language Acquisition Committee (DELAC), and California Association for Bilingual Education (CABE) Con
ference.
 
During Koffee 
Klatch / "Cafecito con la Directora," PTO,SSC, LCAP, Title 1 and reclassification parent informational meetings, parents are 
informed about assessment, 
curriculum, and instruction. We also provide parents with useful information and offer wa
ys they can contribute as active school partners to ensure our 
students receive an excellent education exemplified by a strong home to school partnership.
 
 
We welcome all parents and encourage our parents and family members to visit or volunteer in the cla
ssrooms or at the site, in general. A true effort is 
made to maintain ongoing, and collaborative home to school communication in both English and Spanish.   Parents at Fremont al
so continue participate 
in Parenting Partners for the 2018
-
2019 school year.
 
 
We value our volunteers  and invite you to make a difference at Fremont! To volunteer, feel free to contact our office at (83

in an entire campus systemic supervision process. In class, students
 
receive character education matched to our PBIS behavioral expectations: Be 
Respectful, Be Responsible, and Be Safe. Our PBIS is a school

Most recently, our staff has begun training on ALICE (Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate) Training, which focuses on 
providing preparation and 
a plan for individuals and organizations on how to more proactively handle the threat of an
 
aggressive intruder or active shooter event. A number of 
selected classrooms have or will have participated in an "Alice
-
Lock Down" drill, where barricading exercises take place. Likewise, Fremont counts with 
an Alice member committee.
 
 
We revise our 
School Safety Plan annually, and will be reviewed and approved by our School Site Council by February 2020. School Site Counc

are also informed of the mandated contents and procedures. School Site Council has the opportunity to provide input and 
feedback. The School Site 
Council approves plan by the end of February and then the plan is submitted to Monterey County Office of Education by March 1
st. The plan includes 
procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and location of emergency shut
-
off station
s. We make the plan available in the school office and share it with 
all staff during one of our staff meetings of the school year. The school site's safety plan is reviewed annually by staff an
d School Site Council. Staff is 
informed of the contents of th
e plan, where plan is located, and how plan can be used.  School Site Council members are also informed of the mandated 
contents and procedures. School Site Council has the opportunity to provide input and feedback.
