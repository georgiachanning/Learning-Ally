Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Hope Elementary School District is a rural, single
-
site school district located just southeast of the city of Porterville, with 
approximately 240 Transitional Kindergart
en through eighth grade students served. Originated in 1892, the school district 
is one of the few single
-
school districts in the county serving a TK 

 
8 student population in self
-
contained classrooms. 
Parents, students, and family members report a shared
 
feeling of comfort, safety, and appreciation for the small school, 
family
-
oriented approach of Hope Elementary School District. Our school community has made it a priority to provide 
Hope Elementary School students with the very best 21st century educatio
n possible. Our staff is committed to making 
this school year another exciting and successful experience for each of our students. However, with the growing changes 
in education and the many obstacles faced by school districts statewide, Hope Elementary Sc
hool realizes the ever
-
present 
need to foster and build upon our valued partnerships to be equipped to face those challenges with the tools needed to 
achieve our goals and make our vision a continued reality. Hope Elementary School is dedicated to serving 

individual needs, as well as reaching our overall academic goals. We realize that every student matters and thus we created 
our mission statement, "Every Child, Every Opportunity, Every day". At Hope Elementary School, we provide the essenti
al 
components of a quality school program, a rigorous academic curriculum to challenge and meet the academic needs of 
all our students, but we also help each student discover the talents and gifts that exist inside of them and how sharing 
those attributes 
builds a better world around us. Board members, staff, parents, students, and community members are 
committed to continued improvement and working together to make this school an extraordinary place to be.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There are many opportun
ities for parents to become an active member of the Hope School community. One of those ways 
is by becoming a member of the Hope Parent Club. This group of parents meets monthly to plan activities to raise money 
for student activities and learning opportun
ities. Another way we include parents to be an active participant in their child's 
education is by getting them involved with School Site Council and ELAC. The meetings are open to all parents and 
community members. We offer many school activities througho
ut the school year that involve parents having fun with 
their children at school. The Hope School Carnival is well attended by parents and the community. Parents are also 
encouraged to volunteer in their child's classroom as well as attend any field trips 
their child participates in. Monthly, we 
have all school assemblies where parents are invited to watch their child be recognized by staff members. In addition to 
these things, Hope School manages a Facebook page where parents are kept abreast of school act
ivities and can see what 
is happening in their child's classroom on a regular basis.

scheduled meeting on October 10, 2018.
 
 
Key elements of the plan include: Crisis Response Initial Actions; Duck and Cover, Shelter In Place, Lock Down, Evacuate. 
These drills are practiced monthly at different times of the day. Notes are taken as to what 
needs to be improved upon 
and those details are shared with all staff. At staff development meetings, administration reviews key elements of the 
document so that it is not just a stack of papers but a living and breathing document that we refer back to in 
emergencies. 
Over the summer of 2019, all staff were trained in A.L.I.C.E. (Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate) strategies.

The district, through use of LCAP funds and creation of meaningful and beneficial goals, has been able to slowly increase 
the number of professional development days. Typically the district has enjoyed the use of 
three days at the beginning of 
the school year and one day in October to attend a Small Schools Conference collectively. The days are used to focus on 
curriculum training for better implementation in the classroom and for training in strategies and best te
aching practices 
for English Language Learners.
 
Every Tuesday afternoon after school lets out our staff is involved in Professional Development. The principal leads the 
professional development in the areas of supporting ELL's, goal setting, data, and best
 
instructional practices. These PD's 
are followed up by principal walk
-
throughs, teacher meetings, and in class coaching with teachers. In addition to the 
Tuesday Professional Development Days, teachers are sent to PD with the Tulare County Office of Educa
tion in the areas 
of improving reading, writing, and math practices.
