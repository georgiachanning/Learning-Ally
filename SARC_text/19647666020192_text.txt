School Description
 
 
Our goal in 2019/20 will be to continue the tradition of academic excellence at Meadow Green. Our 
students continue to rank among the highest performing elementary schools not only in the 
Whittier / La Habra area, but across the state of California on year
ly California Smarter Balanced 
summative assessments in both English Language Arts and Math. Strong results on these rigorous 
assessments indicate that Meadow Green produces students who are college and career ready!
 
 
Citizenship, character education, and 
safety are also of the utmost importance at Meadow Green. 
We will also continue to develop students who exhibit traditional qualities and values, such as 
leadership, respect, responsibility, honesty, and integrity through our monthly character education 
th
emes and powerful PBIS program. Our staff at Meadow Green will teach, set, model, and 
reinforce expectations for our students. Students will receive positive recognition through monthly 
character assemblies and our PBIS systems. In conjunction with these p
owerful systems, Meadow 
Green staff utilize social emotional learning, restorative practices, and affective statements to 
support a positive climate. Our students leaders support our students and campus climate through 
the research
-
based Orange County Depa
rtment of Education Peer Assistance Leader (PAL) 
leadership development program. 
 
 
Meadow Green students will continue to learn and master skills in technology that will prepare 
them for 21st century college and careers. Throughout the year students will u
tilize technology 
such as, 1:1 Chromebooks in grades 1
-
6, iPads in grades TK & K and a Science, Technology, 
Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) Lab for hands
-
on learning. Using technology regularly allows 
Meadow Green students to develop 21st century skills
 
in the 4 Cs (communication, collaboration, 
creativity, and critical thinking). Students in grades 5 and 6 learn and practice computer science and 
coding skills to prepare them for advanced classes at Rancho Starbuck and at the high school level. 
Students 
also receive weekly instruction in music thanks to the generous support of the Lowell Joint 
Education Foundation. Instruction in Art is also provided throughout the year. 
 
 
Meadow Green Mission Statement:
 
The mission of Meadow Green Elementary School is to
 
encourage students and staff to seek 
excellence in academic achievement and personal conduct. We are committed to fostering student 
self
-
direction, self
-
motivation, self
-
discipline, and the ability to recognize the importance of 
learning. We believe that 
a close partnership between home, school, and community is essential 
to our students' success in becoming productive citizens and life
-
long learners.
 
 
At Meadow Green Elementary School, we believe: 
 

 
that all students can learn, deserve access to a rich ins
tructional program, and should 
have an equal opportunity to learn in a safe and nurturing environment.
 

 
in teaching good citizenship skills and developing in students an appreciation of 
country.
 

 
that all students are valuable and gain ability, self
-
esteem, 
and pride through their 
diligence, achievements and accomplishments.
 

 
that the choices made today shape the world tomorrow.
 

 
that kindness makes our school a better place.
 

 
that hard work helps us reach our potential.

About the SARC
 
By February
 
1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding 
Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and 
local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school
, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Meadow Green Elementary School parents are involved on many different levels. They are partners with the school as they work 
to get their children to 
school on time each day and as they 
assist in the completion of homework in a timely manner. Parents are encouraged to sign a learning compact at the 
beginning of the school year that outlines the responsibilities of teachers, students, and parents in the support of the educ
ational program o
f our school. 
Parents are also active participants in raising funds that provide for school field trips and assemblies.
 
 
In addition, Parent Teacher Association (PTA) funds support the school
-

ty In Daily 
Effort. All parents are invited to join the PTA.  Parents also serve on the School Site Council, which is the primary site
-
based decision making body on 
campus. This council consists of school staff, teachers, and parents and makes decisions on
 
major budget expenditures of Title I and School Improvement 
Programs and includes an English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) that is in place and a  parent of an English Language Lea
rner serves on  the School 
Site Council (SSC).  Potential parent membe
rs for the SSC are nominated by and voted in by their peers. Flyers for this process are sent home to all 
parents.  SSC member parents play an active role in advising the school about priorities and concerns.  Meadow Green also off
ers reading and literacy 
parent education support n the evenings to support parent engagement and education of students.
 
 
As volunteers, parents regularly assist in supporting classroom teachers and the educational program by assisting in the clas
sroom. Those wishing to 
volunteer 
in the classroom directly contact the teacher. The PTA provides a forum for parents to participate regularly in school activi
ties and functions 
such as student
-
centered activities and fund raisers. Parents are invited to attend monthly awards assemblies th
at honor students for citizenship and 
achievement. They accompany classes on field trips and assist with special projects and presentations at school. Meadow Green
 
holds an annual Holiday 

ng and encouraging parental involvement. Both Back
-
to
-
School Night and Open 
House are excellent opportunities for parents to participate in school functions and become an active part in the school and 

also also family engage
ment opportunities during Red Ribbon Week and Read Across America Week.
 
 
A number of software programs are also available online so that parents can actively encourage and engage their children in l
earning at home. These 
include the MIND Institutes ST Math
, Lexia Core 5, MobyMax, and Reading Plus.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Meadow Green Elementary School is committed to the safety and security of each student.
 
 
To maintain these conditions which contribute to the best 
possible learning environment, the School Safety Plan includes the following elements:
 
 
1.
 
School Crime Assessment: Meadow Green Elementary School provides compiled school crime information each month for the Califor
nia Safe 
School Assessment as mandated by t
he State of California. This information is analyzed at the school site to determine what steps may be taken 
to reduce incidents of crime.
 
 
2.
 
Child Abuse Reporting: Teachers and other school employees are required by law to report any cases of suspected chil
d abuse or child neglect. 
Reports are investigated by the Department of Social Services to determine if any follow
-
up on the report is necessary.
 
 
3.
 
Disaster Procedures and NIMS Report: In order to ensure the safety of students and school personnel, the Scho
ol Safety committee has created 
a comprehensive Disaster Preparedness Plan and specific emergency job duties for all staff are clearly defined in the NIMS Re
port. This Disaster 
Plan is revised and reviewed annually. Emergency fire drills are held once a mo
nth and evaluated for effectiveness. Lockdown and Earthquake 
drills are routinely practiced throughout the year.
 
 
4.
 
School Discipline: Meadow Green Elementary School has created a school
-
wide discipline plan in order to communicate high standards and 
expecta
tions and to hold students accountable for their behavior. The discipline plan is given to every student and reviewed in stud
ent 
assemblies or classroom presentations. Staff members consistently enforce the school
-
wide standards. Meadow Green also has a st
rong 
positive component to its discipline policy. This includes a PRIDE program of recognition for citizenship, good behavior, and
 
responsibility. An 
awards program recognizes students for their positive choices. Upper grade students are invited to join th
e Bully Busters and their focus is to 
encourage and foster positive interaction between students at school. Meadow Green is in the year two of developing our Posit
ive Behavior 
Intervention Strategies Plan (PBIS). Tier two defines behavior expectations for 
all students, in all areas on campus as well as continues with our 
successful recognition program now in place. Tier two also details interventions and student success programs which are in pl
ace to assist a 
smaller population of children whom need more as
sistance, guidance and frequent monitoring for improved behavior.
 
 
5.
 
Sexual Harassment Policy: Meadow Green Elementary School strictly adheres to LJSD policies that prohibit sexual harassment or
 
discrimination 
of any kind.
 
 
6.
 
School
-
wide Dress Code: Meadow Gre
en Elementary School believes that a clearly defined dress code contributes to a positive school 
environment. The primary standards for student dress and grooming include: the student should be neat and clean at school, an
d the student 
should not wear clot
hing that compromises safety or modesty or that is disruptive to the educational process. Each student receives annually 
a written copy of the school dress code.
 
 
7.
 
Safe and Orderly Environment: Meadow Green Elementary School believes a safe and orderly envi
ronment is necessary to ensure a positive 
learning experience for all students. Regular supervision of students is the core of creating and maintaining a safe and orde
rly environment. 
Teachers, administrators, campus supervisors and parent volunteers consi
stently supervise and interact with students to reinforce behavioral 
expectations and safety standards.  Staff, students, and parents are all encouraged to support a bully
-
free campus. Assemblies are held focusing 
on appropriate behavior with others, and a
ll staff, parents, and students are encouraged to sign a kindness pledge. PBIS 
-
 
Positive Behavior 
Intervention Strategies is in place.
 
 
The School Safety Plan is reviewed annually with staff. It was last reviewed, updated annually with SSC.  It was review
ed and updated and approved by 
SSC  on September 12, 2019.

In addition to PLC meetings, teachers also utilize early release Mondays for collaboration during instructional team planning
 
with grade level and 
matriculation colleagues at both the site and distric
t level.
 
 
Staff also receive other PD opportunities throughout the year to attend conferences and receive other training.  Areas for 20
18/19 include, data 
conferences wi
th administration, STEAM conference, CUE conference, PALs, Restorative Practices, EDI, GLAD, Thinking Maps, A2i, and collabor
ation for 
data analysis and curriculum development.
 
 
Support for implementing programs and practices is on
-
going throughout the yea
r.  The Principal conducts classroom visits daily and provides on
-
going 
feedback and support.  In addition, teachers are able to support one another through ITP time on Mondays.  An instructional t
echnology coach is also 
available to support development an
d implementation in that area.  Finally, all grade levels receive several full days of sub release throughout the year 
to receive support from district Ed Services personnel.

Types of Services Funded
 
Meadow Green is not currently in program improvement.
 
 
Title I funds
 
provide economic assistance to supplement the regular instructional program for educationally disadvantaged students.  Expend
itures 
include: Salaries and benefits for small group intervention during and outside of the school day, supplemental materials, s
upplemental supplies, 
technology, professional development/conferences, consultants, professional development for data analysis, curriculum develop
ment, and professional 
development, postage, non
-
capital equipment, and student field trips.
 
 
Title I is util
ized to support students in need of interventions at Meadow Green as a means to supplement and not supplant our CORE program.
 
 
Meadow Green operates the Title I program as a school
-
wide Title I program, targeting achievement school
-
wide.  Meadow Green tran
sitioned from a 
targeted assistance to a school
-
wide program during the 2018/19 school year, as the number of students from socioeconomically disadvantaged 
backgrounds increased above 40% of the total school population.
 
 
A school may operate a SWP if:
 
 
The
 
school's LEA determines that the school serves an eligible attendance area or is a participating school under Section 1113 of
 
the ESEA; and
 
For the initial year of the schoolwide program:
 
The school serves a school attendance area in which not less 
than 40 percent of the children are from low
-
income families; or
 
Not less than 40 percent of the children enrolled in the school are from low
-
income families (34 CFR 200.25[b][1]; ESSA Section 1114[a][1][A]).
 
A school that serves an eligible school attenda
nce area in which less than 40 percent of the children are from low
-
income families, or a school for which 
less than 40 percent of the children enrolled in the school are from such families, may operate a schoolwide program under th
is section if the school
 
receives a waiver from the State educational agency to do so, after taking into account how a schoolwide program will best se
rve the needs of the 
students in the school served in improving academic achievement and other factors (ESSA Section 1114[a][1][B]
). Eligible schools are not required to 
operate the SWP and may choose to remain as a TAS. Additional information about Title I, Part A TAS may be located on the Tit
le I, Part A Targeted 
Assistance Schools web page.

Comprehensive Needs Assessment
 
A scho
ol operating a SWP must conduct a comprehensive needs assessment of the entire school (ESSA Section 1114[b][6]; 34 CFR 200.26
[a][1]). The 
comprehensive needs assessment is based on academic achievement information about all students in the school, includin
g all groups and migratory 
children, particularly the needs of those students who are failing, or are at
-
risk of failing, to meet the challenging State academic standards and any other 
factors as determined by the LEA, and particularly for those students f
urthest away from demonstrating proficiency, so that all students demonstrate at 
least proficiency on the State's academic standards (ESSA Section 1114[b][6]; 34 CFR 200.26[a][1] and [b]).
 
 
A school operating a SWP must also conduct a comprehensive needs a
ssessment to:
 
 
Help the school understand the subjects and skills for which teaching and learning need to be improved (34 CFR 200.26[a][1][i
][A]); and
 
Identify the specific academic needs of students and groups of students who are not yet achieving the Sta
te's academic standards (34 CFR 
200.26[a][1][i][B]).
 
SWP Plan Development
 
An eligible school operating a SWP shall develop a comprehensive plan, that is:
 
 
Developed during a 1
-
year period, unless the LEA determines, in consultation with the school, that less time is needed to develop and implement th
e 
SWP (ESSA Section 1114[b][1]);
 
Developed with the involvement of parents and other members of the community 
to be served and individuals who will carry out such plan (ESSA Section 
1114[b][2]; 34 CFR 200.26[a][2]);
 

SSA Section 1114[b][3]); 
and
 
Regularly monitored and revised as necessary based on student needs and all students have been provided with opportunities to
 
meet the challenging 
State academic standards (ESSA Section 1114[b][3]);
 
Available to the LEA, parents, and the public, and th
e information contained in such plan shall be in an understandable and uniform format and, to the 
extent practicable, provided in a language that the parents can understand (ESSA Section 1114[b][4]); and
 
If appropriate and applicable, developed and coordin
ated and integration with other Federal, State, and local services, resources, and programs (ESSA 
Section 1114[b][5]);
 
The SWP plan shall include descriptions of strategies that the school will be implementing to address school needs (ESSA Sect
ion 1114[b][
7][A]) including 
a description of how such strategies will:
 
 
Provide opportunities for all children, including each of the subgroups of students to meet the challenging State academic st
andards (ESSA Section 
1114[b][7][A][i]);
 
Strengthen the academic progr
am in the school, increase the amount and quality of learning time, and help provide an enriched and accelerated 
curriculum, which may include programs, activities, and courses necessary to provide a well
-
rounded education (ESSA Section 1114[b][7][A][ii]);
 
and
 
Address the needs of all children in the school, but particularly the needs of those at risk of not meeting the challenging S
tate academic standards (ESSA 
Section 1114[b][7][A][iii]).
 
All activities, strategies, and interventions included in the SWP s
hall be evidence
-
based.  Evidence
-
based means the proposed project component is 
supported by one or more of strong evidence, moderate evidence, promising evidence, or evidence that demonstrates a rationale
 
(34 CFR 77.1[c]).
 
 
If programs are consolidated, t
he SWP plan shall include descriptions of the specific LEA programs and other Federal programs that will be consolidated 
in the SWP (ESSA Section 1114[b][7][B]).
 
 
The SWP school must document how it conducted the comprehensive needs assessment, the results
 
it obtained, and the conclusions it drew from those 
results (34 CFR Section 200.26[a][3]).
 
 
Further, an LEA shall ensure that each SWP plan shall be consolidated into a 
School Plan
 
(EC Section 64001[a]), known as the School Plan for Student 
Achievement (S
PSA). The 
School Plan
 
shall be developed and approved by the schoolsite council (EC sections 64001[c] and 65000[b]). Information 
regarding the SPSA is located on the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) web page.
 
 
SWP Plan Evaluation
 
In addition, a
 
school operating a SWP must:
 
 
Annually evaluate the implementation of, and results achieved by, the SWP, using data from the State's annual assessments and
 
other indicators of 
academic achievement (34 CFR 200.26[c][1]);
 
Determine whether the SWP has been 
effective in increasing the achievement of students in meeting the State's academic standards, particularly for 
those students who had been furthest from achieving the standards (34 CFR 200.26[c][2]; and
 
Revise the plan, as necessary, based on the results 
of the evaluation, to ensure continuous improvement of students in the SWP (34 CFR 200.26[c][3]).
 
SWP Consolidation of Funds
 
The SWP may consolidate funds from Federal, State,
 

program (ESSA Section 1114[a][1]; ESSA Section 1114[a][3][A]
-
[B]; 34 CFR 200.25[e]; 34 CFR Section 200.29[a]).

A SWP school that consolidates and uses fund
s from any other Federal program:
 
 
is not required to meet the statutory or regulatory requirements of that program applicable at the school level; but must mee
t the intent and purposes 
of that program to ensure that the needs of the intended beneficiaries
 
(e.g., students, teachers, and parents) of any other federal programs (34 CFR 
200.29[b][1]).
 
must meet the requirements of those programs relating to health; safety; civil rights; student and parental participation and
 
involvement; services to 
private sch
ool children; maintenance of effort; comparability of services; use of Federal funds to supplement, not supplant non
-
Federal funds; and 
distribution of funds to SEAs or LEAs (34 CFR 200.29[b][2]).
 
Is not required to maintain separate fiscal accounting reco
rds, by program, that identify the specific activities supported by those particular funds; but 
must maintain records that demonstrate that the SWP, as a whole, addresses the intent and purposes of each of the Federal pro
grams whose funds were 
consolidated
 
to support the SWP (ESSA Section 1114[a][3][C] and 34 CFR 200.29[d]).
 
If a school consolidates and uses funds from migrant education, Indian education, and special education in its SWP, the schoo
l must meet specific
