About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountab
ility Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and A
ccountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in
 
the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 

re classrooms and campus grounds are well
-
maintained and kept 
safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) employs an electronic work order sys
tem enabling school staff 
to communicate unscheduled maintenance need
s, urgent repairs, or special projects. Most of the school's repairs and maintenance projects are 

ither by the school custodian 
or 
district maintenance staff, based upon the nature of the situation. Day and evening custodians work closely as a team and wit
h the principal for routine 
maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events preparations. The principal and day custodian c
ommunicate daily to discuss campus cleaning 
needs and safety concerns. Every morning before school begins, the custodian, principal, and assistant principal inspect faci
lities for safety hazards, 
graffiti, and other conditions that require removal prior to
 


rs on proper cleaning 
procedures, us
e of chemicals, and use of equipment. The day custodians are responsible for following an established set of cleaning standar
ds and 
prioritization procedures for general campus maintenance. The day custodian checks restrooms twice a day as a proactive meas
ure in keeping facilities 
well stocked, safe, and sanitary. The evening custodians are responsible for thorough cleaning of classrooms, office areas, a
nd restrooms. 
Groundskeepers are dispatched by the district office to perform general maintenance of land
scaping, gardening, sports fields, and irrigation systems.

hievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
