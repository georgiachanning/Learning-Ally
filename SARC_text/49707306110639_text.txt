School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-
20
 
 
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

s, become productive citizens, and responsible stewards of the environment.
 
 
Our Goals for HUSD:
 

 
Students will engage in a rigorous academic curriculum that is differentiated and grounded in real
-
world 
experiences and applications.
 

 
Students will access, ev
aluate, and responsibly use both print and technological resources.

difference.
 

 
Students will exercise positive leadership, valuing and supporting one 
another as contributing citizens of our 
community and world.
 

 
Students will have the knowledge and confidence to make healthy nutritional choices, live physically active 
lives, and demonstrate social and emotional awareness.
 
Our Values as an Educational Com
munity
 
 
As educators we all believe:
 

 
Students leaving our schools will demonstrate respect for themselves, for their peers, adults, and all living 
things, the environment and their school.
 

 
We are all responsible and accountable for our actions.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP]
 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight
 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant co
gnitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or program
s 
of study.

ARK Education Foundation:

profit Education Foundation an
d Parent Group. Harmony Elementary 
School is supported on a continual basis by a network of parent volunteers who assist teachers and staff in and out of the 
classroom. Throughout the year volunteers work tirelessly, raising funds that support many activit
ies and programs for 
the students and teachers at Harmony Elementary School. The ARK Education Foundation is also invaluable for their 
ongoing support to Harmony Elementary School. Harmony Union School District always welcomes and appreciates our 
large com
munity of parent volunteers.
 
 
School Site Council/Charter Advisory Board:
 
The Site Council/Charter Advisory Board serves as the school community representative body for determining the focus 
of the school's academic instructional program and all related ca
tegorical resources. The Legislative intent for the 
formation of school site council is that individuals who are most affected by the operation of the school should have a 
major role in the decisions regarding how a school functions. Education should be a 
joint effort of parents, teachers, 
administrators and other school staff; all who share the common goal in making sure our students are successful. Harmony 
Union School District's Site Council is also the district's Charter Advisory Board. This group meets
 
once a month and
