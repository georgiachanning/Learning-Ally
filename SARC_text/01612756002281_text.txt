School Description
 
Beach School first opened its doors to students in 1912 in Piedmont, a city of about 11,000 
residents, nestled in the hills above the San Francisco Bay Area.  The school is one of three 
elementary schools in Piedmont and serves around 275 students.
 
 
Beach 
Elementary School is a community of thoughtful learners, experienced educators and 
supportive parents. Our school provides an engaging and well
-
rounded environment, and nurtures 
a variety of learning styles and interests. The educational programs at the sc
hool are tailored to be 
both relevant and challenging.  Beach School is proud of its comprehensive supplemental 
instruction, including both vocal and instrumental music, computer science, art, library, and a full 
physical education program.  Beach School c
ollectively ensures the learning and well
-
being of every 
student.
 
 

 
 
Warmth Opens Minds 

 
Warmth is creating an environment where students, teachers and parents 
feel welcome, invited and included. People who are available for learning are people
 
who are happy 
to be where they are. When students are comfortable, their minds are open to new opportunities 
and new ideas.
 
 
Support Students to Help Them to Find Their Strength 

 
Children who receive a lot of support in a 
multiple dimensions will find a 
strength. Starting points and learning rates vary between students 

through carefully designed instruction. We want to develop intrinsic motivation where learnin
g can 
be student
-
driven but teacher
-
directed.
 
 
Engaged Parents mean Engaged Students 

 
We strive to keep parents informed of class curricula 
and school happenings through many media: weekly school and classroom newsletters, regular 
packages of student fini
shed work for review, recommended activities to deepen learning at home, 

education produce engaged learners.

Parent Partnership 

 
Parent co
nferences in the beginning of the year seek to 

be.  Open communication about progress or concerns is a hallmark of cooperation and will take the 
form of e
mails, semi
-
annual conferences and ad hoc meetings.
 
 
Understand then Understood

Higher Order Thinking Skills 

 
Success is not simply students who remember, understand or even 
apply what they have learned.  Our goal is mastery where they can analyze, evaluate and create 
using their newly minted skills.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card
 
(SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Pla
n (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For 
more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

PUSD staff members build their knowledge of curriculum and their repertoire of instructional 
strategies by participating in various types of professional 
learning: local and national conferences, on and off

site workshops, coaching cycles, and as members of professional learning communities. In addition 
to two dedicated professional development da
ys on August 9 and 10, 2018, PUSD has instituted a flexible professional development program, which 
allows all certificated staff to select the professional learning topic and structure that best fit their learning needs.  So
me examples of professional 
dev
elopment selected by tri
-
school elementary teachers are as follows: response to intervention, differentiated math instruction, teaching reading in 
small groups, integrated learning, and social emotional learning. Currently, the professional development pro
gram includes a combination of dedicated 
professional development days and a flexible program.
 
 
New teachers participate in a full day professional development orientation and are assigned a mentor as part of the Teacher 
Induction Program (TIP) or 
may part
icipate with Teachers Engaged in Active Mentoring (TEAM).  Tenured teachers can also participate in coaching by participating
 
in Teachers 
Engaged in Active Mentoring (TEAM).
