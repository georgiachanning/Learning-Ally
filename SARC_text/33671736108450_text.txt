School Description
 
The Sunny Sands School community is dedicated to providing an outstanding elementary program 
that will enable all children to realize their maximum potential in order to lead productive lives as 
responsible, informed citizens.  We will provide a safe, nurt
uring environment that inspires 
individual excellence and integrates the strengths of our diverse community.
 
 
Our goal is to prepare each student to master their grade level California Common Core Standards, 
and to develop proficiency in the English Langua
ge by providing an educational program based on 
the California State Frameworks, current educational research, and best practices.
 
 
Sunny Sands Elementary School and the Palm Springs Unified School District worked cooperatively 
in creating Units of Study, 
benchmark assessments, as well as developing regulations and 
procedures in
-
line with the Education Code and California Department of Education guidelines.  
Both Sunny Sands Elementary School and the Palm Springs Unified School District will work 
cooperativ
ely to monitor and revise the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) annually so 
that it is designed to meet the needs of all Sunny Sands students.
 
 
Sunny Sands Elementary School is in Cathedral City, California, a community in the Coachella Valley 
loc
ated within Riverside County.  Sunny Sands is one of sixteen elementary schools in the Palm 
Springs Unified School District.  Sunny Sands is a school that serves appropriately 720 students 
Transitional kindergarten through fifth grade.  Our dedicated staff
 
enjoys teaching and working 
with a diverse student population.  We have children who speak many languages with Spanish being 
the most dominant.   A little over fifty percent of our students are English Language Learners and 
we offer our ELL students daily
 
English Language Development lessons and Spanish support as 
needed. All Sunny Sands students are provided with a free Breakfast and Lunch each date.  Sunny 
Sands has an attendance rate of approximately 96%. The Sunny Sands staff believes in strong home 
to
 
school communication and we strive to work in partnership with our families.
 
 
Assessment results are made available to parents during parent conferences, through progress 
reports, and annual State Testing results are mailed to parents.  The State Test res
ults are reviewed 
with parents during parent conferences each school year.
 
 
Monitoring comments and data are added to the SPSA throughout the school year to evaluate the 
effectiveness of Sunny Sands' school plan.  Revisions to the SPSA, and subsequent Boar
d approval, 
will occur if there are substantial budget and/or material changes during the school year.
 
 
Our school will evaluate the effectiveness of our SPSA shortly after State Test Results are released 
and/or after  Benchmark Assessments are given.  The
 
School Site Council and other leadership 
groups have had the opportunity to review all student achievement data. The School Plan for 
Student Achievement is updated annually by the Sunny Sands School Site Council.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Each year we have designed professional learning based on student achievement data, research of best practices and discussion
s with teachers and 
principals. The specific approaches vary by content area. For ELA, in 2017
-
18, the focus was on aligning instru
ction to Smarter Balanced Assessments, 
depth of knowledge, and deeper understanding of the Reading Targets in Claim 1. In 2018
-
19 the focus was on the gradual release model, and 2019
-
20 
was an extension of the previous two years. The professional developme
nt in these areas was provided by the Schoolhouse Project. In 2018
-
19 the 

ceptual understanding. 
The training will take place over 
the course of three years.  During Year 1 (2018
-
19) the focus was on developing strategies to support number sense by 
implementing mental math routines and highlight the landscape of learning in mathematics. During Year 2 (2019
-
20) the focus is on strength
ening mental 
math routines, identifying the math goal of a lesson, and planning for and implementing a three
-
part lesson (Launch, Explore, Summarize). This 
professional development also supports teachers with the implementation of the district
-
adopted math
 
program (Bridges in Mathematics and Number 
Corner).
 
The numbers in the chart above represent 12 days of ELA training in 2017
-
18. For both 2018
-
19 and 2019
-
20 there are 6 days per year of training for ELA. 
The remaining number of days in 2018
-
19 and 2019
-
2
0 are full days of professional learning for math.
