School Description
 
 
Principal's Message
 
It is my pleasure to welcome you to Valley View's Elementary School Annual Accountability Report 
Card.  Valley View is home of the Mustangs and our vibrant community of learners.  Valley View is 
located in the eastern region of Pleasanton and serves studen
ts in transitional kindergarten through 
fifth grade following a traditional calendar.  At the beginning of the 2019
-
2020 school year, 667 
students were enrolled.  The English Only (EO) and Spanish Dual Immersion (DI) programs here at 
Valley View each serve
 
approximately half our school's population and are strongly committed to 
equitable learning, academic excellence, and social development for all students.  Our experienced 
and fully credentialed staff meets the needs of ALL of our students through MTSS, m
ulti
-
tiered 
systems of supports.  Tier 1 includes interventions and enrichment in the classroom, Tier II supports 
are offered during our Universal Access time and Tier III supports are offered through our Special 
Education department.  The curriculums used
 
for both our DI and EO programs are aligned with the 
California State Standards and frameworks, and state compliance criteria.
 
 
Honored in 2003 with the CABE (California Association of Bilingual Education) Seal of Excellence 
and in 2006 as a California Di
stinguished School, Valley View continues to stand out as a school that 
is student
-
centered focused on academic achievement for all children.  Our dedicated staff 
continually reassesses our academic outcomes and refines our teaching and learning practices 
around student success.
 
 
Valley View and all schools in Pleasanton Unified set very high expectations for student 
achievement and continue to implement Best Practices in Teaching with California State Standards.  
The California Standards aim to prepare all
 
students for college and career readiness and as 21st 
Century Learners who will think critically and at deeper levels, and collaborate with others to 

Better Wo

 
 
Our faculty, School Site Council (SSC) comprised of teachers, staff, and parents, and English Learners 
Advisory Committee (ELAC); regularly reviews site assessment data to develop the 
School Plan
 
for 
Student Achievement (SPSA) each year.  Our main f
ocus this year will be equity for all learners and 
the narrowing of the achievement gap that exists for our diverse student population especially our 
ELL (English Language Learners).
 
 
Mission: We are a child
-
centered, forward thinking, learning community, 
educating each of our 
students in an individually appropriate manner within an environment of personal safety and 
mutual respect to become well
-
informed, productive, and socially responsible citizens.

We Believe...
 

 
All students are unique, can learn and deserve a 
challenging and enriching curriculum.
 

 
Collaboration and open communication support a positive teaching and learning environment
 

 
Working as a team leads to high levels of achievement and character development for students and staff
 

 
Parents play a vital role
 
in their child's education and are valued partners in this effort
 

 
Maintaining a safe environment, physically and emotionally, creates a positive place for students to learn and staff to work
 

 
Having a sense of humor and pursuing the joy of learning creates
 
a positive school culture and climate
 
 
Our school community benefits from active parent and community participation in regular and extracurricular school activities
.  Many 
other positive school activities rely and depend on parent volunteers who help with
 
school fairs, school beautification projects, and other 

-
round fundraising to foster school and community efforts that support powerful 
teaching and learning.  Friends and families are always invited to b

with that same enthusiasm and pride that we say to you, "Welcome to the View!"
 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every
 
school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all loc
al educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Addi
tionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For addition
al information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Instructional Materials
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Valley View Elementary School are currently being aligned to the California Stat
e Standards.  Instructional 
mat
erials are selected from the state's most recent list of standards
-
based materials and adopted by the State Board of Education.  The district follows 
the State Board of Education's six
-
year adoption cycle for core content materials (English/language arts, 
math, science, and social science).
 
 
On Tuesday, September 24, 2019, the Pleasanton Unified School District's Board of Trustees held a public hearing to certify t
he extent to which textbooks 
and instructional materials have been provided to students.  The 
Board of Trustees adopted Resolution 2019
-
2020.004 which certifies as required by 
Education Code §60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional materials were provided to all students, including English learner
s, in the district to the extent 
that each pupil 
has a textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient textbooks and instru
ctional materials 
were provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and
 
consistent with the cycles and content 
of the curriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English/language arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional
 
materials used for their visual/performing 
arts curricula.  During the 2019
-
20 school year, Pleasanton Unified School District provided each student, including English learners, enrolled in a 
visual/performing arts class with a textbook or instructional m
aterials to use in class and to take home.  These materials complied with the state's content 
standards and curriculum frameworks.

State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.
