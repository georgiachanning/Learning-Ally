About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental 
Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
A  very active parent group supports Jordan th
rough their involvement in the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) , School Site Council (SSC), and the English 
Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) . PTA offers family activities including movie nights, Stoves on Strikes fundraisers at loc
al restaurants,  famil
y STEM 
challenges, and fun run.   SSC and ELAC meetings are held on a regular basis throughout the year.  In addition to participati
on is these groups, parents 
volunteer in classrooms, the school library, and assist with special events. Jordan Elementary s
chool has partnered with a local non
-
profit group, Hope 
Heals Hearts, in providing clothing to families in need.
 
 
Parents are kept informed of school events and opportunities for involvement through the school website, weekly phone message
s that go out in 
English 
and Spanish, calendars, notices, and the school marquee. In addition, the Jordan PTA keeps parents informed with weekly email
s and social media via 
Facebook. Any parents wishing to become involved may also contact the school office.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides 
the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Staff at Jordan Elementary  believe that in ord
er for students to learn they must feel safe at school. To ensure student safety, Jordan Elementary  has in 
place a school
-
wide discipline plan, a disaster preparedness plan, and a comprehensive school safety plan. School rules and behavior standar
ds are c
learly 
communicated to students at the beginning of the year. Upon returning from Winter Break, students attend a brief assembly to 
review these 
expectations. The principal is responsible for making sure the school
-
wide discipline plan is fairly and consis
tently enforced. The staff regularly reviews 
the school wide discipline plan at staff meetings throughout the year.
 
 
The disaster preparedness plan is designed to cover emergencies such as fires, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. The 
plan is review
ed annually 
with staff so all persons are aware of their roles in the event of a disaster. In addition, the school holds regular fire and
 
earthquake drills so students and 
staff are familiar with procedures covering both potential events.
