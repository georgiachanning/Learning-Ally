By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Oak Creek Elementary School opened in September 2002 to serve the students within the Oak Creek community. Our 
attend
ance area includes all Oak Creek as well as the newer residential developments in the Spectrum community. Student 
enrollment typically fluctuates between 900
-
930 students in grades Kindergarten through Six. The Oak Creek Elementary 
campus also hosts a regi
onal Autism Specific Program and on
-
campus child care facility (CDC) for students in all grades. 
Our beautiful campus is nestled within the residential area of Oak Creek which is composed of single dwelling homes, 
condominiums, and apartments. Our building
s and grounds are well
-
maintained, and boast desirable features such as 
ample natural light and square footage, shared collaborative spaces, and state of the art educational technologies. 
 
 
Our school and community at large are characterized by great pride
, spirit, and diversity. This is evident at our many family 
events throughout the year, including Movie Night, International Food Faire, Jog
-
a
-
thon, Open House and Spring Fling. 
Throughout the year, we enjoy a high level of parent involvement, including da
ily volunteerism, special event planning, 
and participation in regular Parent Teacher Association, English Language Advisory Committee and School Site Council 
meetings.
 
 
Like all IUSD schools, Oak Creek prides itself on fostering high levels of academic ac

physical, social, and emotional growth. As a staff of lifelong learners, we are committed to serving our school community 
in four main areas:
 
 
CULTURE
 
We strive to create a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment t
hat supports the needs of our diverse learners while 
simultaneously encouraging our students to explore, experiment, and take risks in problem solving and learning.
 

 
Our campus community is dedicated to providing supports for all students' academic, behavio
ral, and 
social/emotional needs.
 

 
We embrace differences and celebrate each student's unique qualities by recognizing success and achievement 
in multiple ways.
 

 
We work to understand the varying needs of our students and dissolve barriers to success.
 
COLLABO
RATION (PLC)
 
We work collaboratively based on common goals to ensure that all students feel valued and are supported.
 

 
Teachers meet regularly to analyze student data, monitor progress, refine instructional practices, create 
common assessments, and identify
 
learning targets.
 

 
We align goals, resources, and learning targets in support of all students.
 

 
We communicate across grade levels to ensure continuity of instruction and provide an equitable learning 
environment in each classroom.
 

 
We proactively collaborat
e as a staff across campus in support of all students' social/emotional well
-
being.
 
CURRICULUM & INSTRUCTION
 
We implement an equitable instructional program that promotes active engagement and reflective problem solving. Our 
teaching practices are intentio
nal, flexible, and responsive to the needs of our students. We utilize:

We promote and facilitate open communication 
with parents and families.
 

 
We value opportunities for parents, families, and our community to be involved and engaged within our school.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Oak Creek Elementary School opened in September 2002.
  
Our school boasts a highly functional and desirable layout 
wherein most classrooms are oriented around a common collaborative area, referred to as a "pod." In addition, the central 
hub of our campus is the media center, which is used for student and staf
f collaboration, as well as accessing online and 
print resources. Another critical feature of our campus is the multipurpose room, and adjoining classrooms.  These areas 

nd physical education. All campus 
spaces feature abundant natural light, courtesy of tinted windows and skylights.
 
 
All of our common areas, classrooms and offices feature wired and wireless connectivity, as well as mechanisms for display 
of digital resour
ces (via LCD projectors and televisions). Our school and district continue to invest in our infrastructure to 

 
 
Our recreation area features a
 
mix of open space and designated play equipment that our students enjoy during recess 
and structured physical education times. Our exterior areas are maintained daily by site custodial staff and weekly by 
District maintenance crews.
 
 
Our interior faciliti
es are impressively maintained, according to annual reviews by District personnel. Our custodial staff 
consists of a full
-
time day custodian, a 4
-
hour evening custodian who attends to trash and restrooms each night, and an 
8
-
hour evening custodian who atte
nds to vacuuming and other deep cleaning every other day.
 
 
Routine maintenance needs are supported by District personnel in a timely manner, and our long
-
term facility needs will 
be addressed via upcoming projects to be funded by the voter
-
approved initiat
ive Measure E. This will result in the creation 
of a new, all
-
weather lunch area shelter, as well as a sizable new building to support music instruction.
 
 
The safety of our campus is attended to via completion of and adherence to our annually
-
revised Compr
ehensive School 
Safety Plan. From a facilities standpoint, the plan calls for the securing of our front gates each day, and the requirement 
of all visitors to enter campus through the front office. In the front office, all visitors must present valid ID, w
hich allows 
them to be screened through an electronic database of known offenders. All staff, including playground supervisors, are 
trained to approach and redirect anyone not wearing a volunteer ID badge during school hours, and most doors on campus 
are k
ept locked and secured while students are present. Procedures for safe ingress and egress of students are also 
published annually for students and parents. These support the orderly flow of pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular traffic on 
and adjacent to campu
s.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achie
vement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alter
nate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achieveme
nt standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

At Oak Creek, we encourage and
 
appreciate family and community participation and involvement throughout the school 
year. Beginning with the first day of school at our Welcome Breakfast, our Family Movie Night in the fall, the Jog
-
a
-
thon 
in early spring, our Spring Fling & Open House in
 
May, and everything in between, we provide a variety of social functions 
and Oak Creek community events with fun for the entire family.
 
 
We strongly encourage all parents to join and participate in the Parent Teacher Association (PTA). Through information
al 
meetings, fundraisers, and other school
-
wide events, programs, and assemblies, our PTA enhances the student experience 
here at Oak Creek.
 
 
Parent Volunteers are paramount to the success of students and staff alike in support of our school

wide mission t
o 
provide the highest quality learning experience we can envision.  Their time in classrooms working with small groups of 
students, enables our teachers to provide targeted instruction in smaller teacher to student ratios.  Parents that are not 
able to vol
unteer on a regular basis  can assist with field trips, and/or help coordinate classroom events and activities.
 
 
In addition to participation in PTA and classroom assistance, parents serve on various school

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Oak Creek Elementary School is a P.B.I.S. 
school which positively and consistently reinforces desirable student behavior 
with praise and incentives. Each student learns the expectations for Oak Creek student behavior at the beginning of the 
school year through classroom orientations and school tou
rs. During this time, students are shown the W.I.S.E. OWL way 
to behave as well as behavior that is not the W.I.S.E. OWL Way. W.I.S.E. is our acronym to help students remember our 
school
-
wide expectations: Winning Attitude, Integrity, Show Respect & Respon
sibility, and Encourage Others.
 
 
2018
-

When students exhibit W.I.S.E. behavior, they are praised by staff members and positively reinforced with W.I.S.E. Owl 
tickets. In addition to tickets for small deeds, teachers award a predetermined number of W.I.S.E. Owl c
ertificates each 
month to students observed demonstrating desirable behaviors in a way that benefits themselves and others. We are now 
in our tenth year of collectively motivating and recognizing students through our school
-
wide program.
 
 
Another element o
f the program is the discipline referral procedure. As a staff, we have identified major and minor 
behaviors that must be addressed. We monitor this data on our behavior citations and office referral forms through an 
online database in order to implement p
roactive measures to better support our students. We have seen a significant 
improvement each year in student conduct since implementing P.B.I.S. at Oak Creek.
 
 
As a staff, we also conduct annual parent and student surveys regarding school climate and safe
ty. Based on the 
recommendations from these surveys, as well those from Student Supervision Staff, practices are refined and problematic 
areas are addressed.
 
 

 
the privilege of having all 
of our IUSD campuses open to the community and free from fencing or major security measures. With this freedom, 
however, comes the additional responsibility of maintaining heightened vigilance to ensure that students stay on ca
mpus 
and strangers stay off campus. Our playground staff and teachers work together to ensure that students are well
-
supervised from the time they are dropped off in the morning until the time they reunite with their parents in the 
afternoon. Parent volunt
eers must check in through the office and wear an identifying Volunteer sticker that includes 
detailed information throughout their visit to Oak Creek. In addition, we have installed a remote notification system at 
the gate near the entrance to CDC. This i
s intended to decrease incidents of unidentified adults and vendors on campus 
during school hours.
 
 
School
-
wide Fire, Disaster, and Lock down drills are regularly conducted throughout the year. Further, we work with 
students, parents, city officials and IP
D to address matters of student safety to and from school in a proactive manner. 
Through our school
-
wide Walk to School Wednesdays Program, we encourage non
-
vehicular commute and healthy 
physical activity.
 
 
These are the Goals and Objectives we will focus 
on for the 2019
-
20 school year:
 
1. Ensure the prompt and regular attendance of Oak Creek students through implementing a variety of proactive and 
reactive measures.
 
2. Ensure that our W.I.S.E. Owl behavioral expectations are promoted and reinforced with fi
delity across all settings and 
grade levels.
 
3. Execute a variety of drills throughout the year that test the capacity of our school community to respond in an organized 
and efficient manner to a variety of emergency scenarios.
 
4. Maintain a safe, secure, 
and closed campus during school hours.

to school districts.  In 
place of more than 40 specific funding categories, the new model has established three sources of state funding with 
increased local discretion to determine how best to spend those funds in the service of students.  All districts 
receive a 
BASE of per
-
student funding that varies slightly depending on grade level.  All districts also receive SUPPLEMENTAL 
funding.  IUSD has used BASE and SUPPLEMENTAL funding to support the following programs:
 
 
Site Programs and Services:  1) Support 
professional learning and teacher coaching through induction program, content 
TOSAs and teacher mentor program , 2) provide summer school and summer athletic programs, 3) Allocating site funding 
and staffing to support student achievement through support o
f Professional Learning Communities (PLC) and site PLC 
coaches, 4) Elementary P.E. paraprofessionals, 5) Support for English language learners, 6) Elementary science, music, and 
art programs, 7) Purchase textbooks and instructional materials, 8) Develop a 
technology rich learning environment 
including; Technology matching programs, Technology Maintenance fund and site technology support staff, 9) Maintain 
previously implemented class
-
size reduction, 10) Additional secondary sections to reduce class size, 11
) Middle school 
zero period program, 12) Maintain positive behavioral intervention and support program, 13) Maintain site staffing with 
full
-
time assistant principals, 14) 450:1 counseling ratio, support for large elementary schools and elementary classroo
m 
aides, 15) Support interventions and supplemental programs impacting English learners, low income and foster youth, 16) 
Continue to build Career
-
Technical Education pathways and blended 0n
-
line learning opportunities for students, 17) 
Develop mental heal
th and wellness programs and hire district and site based staff including support for the Irvine Family 
Resource Center.
 
 
Finally, CONCENTRATION grant funding equal to 50 percent of the base is provided to districts in which English
-
learners, 
low
-
income st
udents and foster youth exceed 55 percent of the total enrollment.  Irvine Unified School District is not 
eligible for concentration funding because its enrollment does not exceed the 55 percent threshold.

At Oak Creek, our staff development plan is developed utilizing our school site plan in an effort to ensure that we achieve 
site  goals for student achievement. To that end, our plan includes a focus on Response to Instruction
 
(RTI), Professional 
Learning Communities (PLC), Restorative Practices and Positive Behavior Intervention & Support (PBIS), Educational 
Technology, and Health/Safety. Our professional development is delivered in four six
-
hour days and three two
-
hour 
aftern
oon sessions. Ongoing support of implementation after professional development occurs through principal 
feedback during classroom visitations, collaboration with grade level teams and collaboration among site leadership team 
members.
