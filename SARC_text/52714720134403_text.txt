One size does not fit all!
 
Students and parents need educational opportunities. In communities, small and large,
 
too many 
students are forced to conform to an educational model that does not fit their learning styles. This 
problem is often greatest in smaller towns where there are fewer schools from which to choose. 
The leadership team for this charter recognizes th
at this must change in our area. Our mission is to 
provide students and their parents with an academically challenging educational experience that 
has relevance to 21st Century Learners. We will strive to create an environment that offers choice, 
variety, 
and hands
-
on learning. We believe that students learn best when freed of the constraints 
of the regimented practices of the past. By employing inquiry
-
based, thematic units of study and 
hands
-
on fieldwork opportunities, our school will allow students to pr
ogress at a rate that is 
commensurate with their skills, and interests. Furthermore, our model allows for students to 

 
 
LAVA Charter School will strive to develop a culture t
hat allows students to acquire the skills and 
knowledge that will motivate them to become lifelong learners. It is our goal to transition each 
student successfully to higher education or the workplace, and become a productive member of a 
democratic society
 
that allows all students equal opportunity and access to this process.
 
 
LAVA Charter School is located approximately 130 miles north of Sacramento in the city of Red 
Bluff. We are a 5th
-
8th grade middle school in the Antelope Elementary School District. L
AVA 
Charter School opened in August of 2016. The enrollment for 2018
-
2019 was 100 students.
 
 
LAVA offers hybrid and traditional Independent Study Programs. Our hybrid students attend 3
-
5 
days each week. Students may choose to attend core classes only 
(math, English, Spanish, science, 
and social science) from the hours of 8:30
-
12:30. Most, however, attend afternoon classes that 

required to complete 80% of all
 

Traditional ISP students are required to attend, by appointment, a minimum of once per week with 
the assigned teacher. Traditional ISP students are required to complete 80% of all assigned wor

LAVA Charter School has a unique relationship with Lassen Volcanic National Park. Through our 
agreement, we have access to the park, its rangers and instructors, and its resources that few 
schools can off
er. LAVA students travel to the park several times per year to learn natural sciences 
from experts in their respective fields. Furthermore, Lassen Volcanic National Park has 

 
 

s identified as 71.74% White (NON
-
HISPANIC), 22.8% 
Hispanic or Latino, 1 .06% African American and 3.26% Multi
-
ethnic (NON
-
HISPANIC). LAVA is 
designed to meet each child's physical, intellectual, emotional and social needs in a safe and 
comfortable setting
. The school structure is flexible and adaptable allowing students to attend Â½ 
or full days. The schools climate, like learning, is a continually changing process, and one that we 
try to keep evolving using the latest educational theories and research as w
ell as some of the more 
traditional views of education. Technology is an integral facet of learning at LAVA Charter School. 
Students have 1

developing 21st century digital lear
ning skills.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

nistration. Each year, a 
parent volunteer is solicited to be a part of
 
our board. This parent serves as a liaison between families and LAVA Charter School.
 
Parents are required to meet with the school staff once every 4 weeks to review and sign work records and attendance reports.
 
Parents are welcome and encouraged to attend
 
district level board meetings and LCAP Meetings.
 
Parents are also encouraged to get involved in our many learning opportunities we experience at Lassen Volcanic Park.
