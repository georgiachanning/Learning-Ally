By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in
 
good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority. The Maintenance Department responds to our needs in a timely manner. The di
strict governing 
board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the school
 
office and at the district office. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedul
es to ensure 
a clean and safe school. The custodial staff cleans restrooms and classrooms daily as inspected by the site administration 
on a weekly basis.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The staff of 
William Anderson School believes that the education of its students is a responsibility shared with parents. 
Parents shall have the responsibility and opportunity to work with the school in a mutually supportive and respectful 
partnership with the goal of 
helping their children succeed in school.
 

 
Each year in September parents shall be invited to attend an annual Title 1 meeting on the rights of parents to 

eeting 
to accommodate parent schedules.
 

 
Written notice of the meeting and information on Parent Involvement and our School
-
Parent Compact will be 
reviewed and updated at that meeting each year. Once policy and compact are approved and revised, they will 
be
 
posted on our school website and copies will be sent home to all families.
 

 
Communication in both English and Spanish will be conducted via the Blackboard system along with dual 
language flyers sent home with students to inform parents of ongoing opportuni
ties to be involved in activities 
at school.
 

 
All parents are encouraged to function as active members of our PTA, ELAC committee, and our School Site 
Council which all meet on a monthly basis.
 

 
William Anderson has an on
-
staff parent/community liaison to in
crease parent communication and participation 
and provide support to families in need.
 

 
Parents will be kept informed regarding the progress of students in the core academic program, along with 
student support programs, classroom activities and school event
s.
 

 
We will use the results of an annually administered Parent Needs Assessment Survey to plan for informational 
meetings and workshops to address topics requested and needed by parents.
 

 
A school committee addressing Parent Engagement Topics will meet month
ly to develop topics, venues, and 
activities to encourage and support parent involvement at our school both during and before and after school.
 

 
We will train and support parents in leadership roles to effectively serve on the PTA, School Site Council, and 
ELAC committee.
 

 
William Anderson School, to the extent practical, shall provide parents with limited English proficiency 
opportunities to fully participate in school sponsored activities by using translation at all meetings and 
workshops and by sending wri
tten notices and reports in a language (to the extent possible) that parents 
understand.

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
To keep students safe on school grounds before, during, and after the school day, we have instituted several safety 
programs.  We have varied the entry and exit routes that are known and practiced daily. We have two gates where 
stud
ents may enter school and and four gates where students exit school.  Additionally, we post an adult there to ensure 
that students are safe. At the end of the day, teachers walk all students out to the front or back gates. All personnel wear 
badges and stu
dents know and report any adult on campus who is not wearing a badge. To get on the campus during the 
day, adults must check in at the office and are given a visitor sticker to wear, so the students know that this person has 
entered the school with permiss
ion.
 
 
Student safety has been further enhanced by the introduction of a school wide behavior expectations as well as behavior 
assemblies to teach appropriate behavior.
 
 
A Comprehensive School Safety Plan was adopted in February 2007. We have reviewed it ev
ery year since with the School 
Site Council and Anderson Staff to make sure that it is still viable. The Safety Plan was last discussed with all staff on 
October 15, 2019. The key components of the plan include three different drills and the chain of comma
nd in the case of 
an emergency. In addition, the plan details what chemical and poisons are prohibited at school. Also lists the various safe 
practices for students inside and out of classroom. Universal bell schedules were implemented in 2004 so that emer
gency 
bell signals are the same at all schools. Each classroom has a safety backpack which stays with the teacher during 
emergencies. Emergency drills for fire, lock down/lock out, earthquake, and other emergencies are held on a regular basis.

The LESD Education Services team in collaboration with the Language Arts Specialists, Math TOSAs, English Language 
Instructional Resource Teachers and Principals have designed a 
comprehensive system for monthly professional 
development.  All district professional development occurs on Thursdays after school following an early release day.   
Topics are selected based on expressed teacher need and identified student deficiencies.  A
ll professional development in 
the LESD focuses on meaningful collaboration, developing teacher capacity and the implementation of research based 
practices to support student achievement.
 
 
Professional development focuses on the instructional shifts needed
 
to meet the rigorous demands of the Common Core 
State Standards and the need to support development of academic discourse for all students, with an emphasis on English 
language learners.  All TK
-
5th grade teachers receive professional development support 
in the areas of social
-
emotional 
learning, Math warm
-
ups, and integrated ELD. Collaboration time is spent on data analysis and planning in the areas of 
English Language Arts, Math, and ELD. Teachers receive professional development in structured cycles tha
t afford them 
the opportunity to learn about a new concept, plan for implementation with their colleagues, practice their learning with 
students, and then come back with their colleagues to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of their instructional 
implem
entation of the new skill.
 
 
Feedback about the effectiveness of the professional development is regularly collected to assess the effectiveness of the 
program and make changes as needed.  Additionally, site staff members and Educational Services team membe
rs regularly 
visit classrooms to determine the level of implementation of the professional development focus.
