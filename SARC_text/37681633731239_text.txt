of
 
each

every
 
school

required
 
by
 
state
 
law
 
to
 
publish
 
a
 
School
 
Accountability
 
Report
 
Card
 
(SARC).
 
The
 
SARC
 
contains
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
condition
 
and
 
performance
 
of
 
each
 
California
 
public

Formula
 
(LCFF)
 
all

are
 
required
 
to
 
prepare
 
a
 
Local
 
Control
 
and
 
Accountability
 
Plan
 
(LCAP),
 
which
 
describes
 
how
 
they
 
intend
 
to
 
meet
 
annual
 
school-specific
 
goals
 
for
 
all
 
pupils,
 
with
 
specific
 
activities
 
to
 
address
 
state
 
and
 
local
 
priorities.
 
Additionally,
 
data
 
reported
 
in
 
an

Description
 
and
 
Mission
 
Statement
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
JCS
 
LIVE
 
is
 
the
 
latest
 
venture
 
in
 
the
 
JCS
 
family
 
of
 
schools.
 
JCS
 
LIVE
 
(Lifelong
 
Independent
 
Virtual
 
Education)
 
was
 
established
 
in
 
the
 
2019
 
Œ
 
2020
 
school
 
year
 
as
 
a
 
fully
 
online
 
program.
 
JCS
 
LIVE
 
is
 
sponsored
 
by
 
the
 
Julian
 
Union
 
School
 
District.
 
Unlike
 
the
 
other
 
family
 
of
 
schools,
 
JCS
 
LIVE
 
does
 
not
 
have
 
a
 
campus
 
or
 
academy
 
classes.
  
Students
 
work
 
with
 
their
 
teachers
 
through
 
an
 
online
 
platform
 
and
 
participate
 
in
 
activities
 
online.
 
During
 
the
 
pilot
 
year,
 
JCS
 
LIVE
 
will
 
serve
 
between
 
25
 
and
 
50
 
students.
 
JCS
 
LIVE
 
will
 
serve
 
students
 
in
 
grades
 
6-12
 
the
 
first
 
year,
 
integrating
 
the
 
vetted
 
online
 
curriculum
 
to
 
include
 
a
 
Career
 
and
 
Technical
 
(CTE)
 
focus.
  
During
 
the
 
first
 
year,
 
there
 
will
 
be
 
(2)
 
pathways
 
from
 
which
 
students
 
can
 
choose:
 
(1)
 
business
 
and
 
(2)
 
information
 
technology.
 
Students
 
desiring
 
a
 
different
 
pathway
 
will
 
be
 
given
 
the
 
opportunity
 
through
 
Odysseyware
 
Online
 
or
 
our
 
partners
 
at
 
the
 
local
 
community
 
college.
 
The
 
mission
 
of
 
JCS
 
LIVE
 
is
 
to
 
provide
 
an
 
alternative
 
classroom
 
setting
 
tailored
 
for
 
students
 
who
 
desire
 
a
 
synchronous,
 
online,
 
personalized
 
environment
 
focused
 
on
 
Career
 
and
 
Technical
 
Education.
