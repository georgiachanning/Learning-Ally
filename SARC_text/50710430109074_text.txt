Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month
 
in which data were collected:
 
2019/10
 
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 12, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursua
nt to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take ho
me.
 
 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all
 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption.
 
 
The table displays inform
ation collected in August, 2019 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
We moved in to the new school facility in January 2006.  Construction for four additional portable classrooms were started 
in the summer of 
2006 and occupied in January 2007.    The field was seeded, moved the bike racks, and also the the 
kindergarten playground was completed.  The 1
-
6 grade playground was finished in November 2008.
 
 
Administration meets regularly with the head custodian on th
e condition of the grounds, buildings, and restrooms.  We 
provide a checklist for the District Safety Committee four times a year.   Twice a year we receive a site visit from the dist
rict 
office on the condition of the school.  The last visit we received a
 
score of 9 out of 10.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., 
California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/
literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California St
ate University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
A team of staff members called the PAWS Team meet on a monthly basis.  This team is focusing on the works of the 
Hannigan's.    We have identified common areas for the site and have written procedure
s which have been communicated 
to staff and taught to the students.   These include drop off and pick up of students, use of restrooms, playground, 
cafeteria, and coming to and from the classrooms, etc.   A survey on school safety was given in the spring t
o staff, students, 
and parents. The PAWS Team meets monthly to review current data, address concerns, and make recommendations for 
corrections.   The School Safety Plan was approved by the School Site Council in January of 2020.     An area of focus for 
th
e upcoming year will be get students engaged in more structured play activities during recess.  The goal is to target 
specific social skills during this time.

In  the 2017
-
2018 school year, the school site has planned 10 collaboration/early release days and 5 professional 
development days.   In the 2018
-
2019 school year,

Staff development is a critical component to teacher and student success, and Ceres Unified School District is dedicated 
to a variety of professional development opportunities for staff.  There is dedicated time approximately once a week for 
Pr
ofessional Learning Communities to meet in order for staff to: collaborate, learn strategies, and develop action plans to 
meet identified student needs.
 
 
The district participates in the induction program for new teachers and other county and state approve
d formal training 
programs dedicated to improving teacher quality.  In addition, the district fully supports classroom teachers with full time 
Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA's) who can assist with the implementation of curriculum and strategies. Scho
ol 
sites must include a professional development plan and budget in their school site plan.  Activities can include attendance 
at summer institutes, after school or Saturday workshops, teacher release days to attend conferences, and grade level or 
departme
nt release days for in depth professional development.  All professional development is aligned to the district 
road map plan and district strategic plan.    The goal of all professional development is to increase student achievement.
 
 
Teacher release days
 
as well as district provided training's are offered to staff on a regular basis.  Staff have the option to 
be out of the classroom for up to 6 days to participate in these activities.  Activities chosen are typically teacher driven 
with admin input/recomm
endations.
