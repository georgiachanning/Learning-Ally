By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Inspire, Empower, Take Action is our motto at Orangewood Elementary School.
 
 
Reflecting Southern California's rich, multicultural heritage, Orangewood Elementary is a diverse transitional kindergart
en 
through grade 5 learning community serving 632 students. Recognizing the power of the IB programmes, West Covina 
Unified School District established the International World Schools of West Covina 
-
 
a TK through grade 12 continuum. In 
July 2017, Orangewo
od Elementary earned World School authorization in the Primary Years Programme, taking its place 
as the starting point for that continuum.
 
 
Students who read, write, think, and communicate in two languages are best prepared for college, career, and the glo
bal 
economy. Dual immersion not only provides students with the advantage of bi
-
literacy, but it also cultivates cognitive 
flexibility and international mindedness. At Orangewood, families have the choice of enrolling their child in a Spanish or 
Mandarin d
ual
-
immersion pathway. Students who continue their language studies in WCUSD will be eligible to earn the 
California Seal of Biliteracy with their high school diploma.
 
 
As part of Orangewood's commitment to providing a well
-
rounded curriculum, we incorpora
te technology and the arts. 
To enhance learning through 21st
-
century skills, we introduce the use of 1:1 tech devices beginning with iPads in 
kindergarten and Chromebooks in grade 2. Coding and robotics are studied by all Orangewood students, serving as an
 
early bridge to our district Career Technical Education pathway. Additionally, weekly dance lessons allow all students to 
explore, study, and perform throughout elementary school.
 
 
Ultimately, the strength of Orangewood Elementary lies in our wholehearted
 
approach to creating a principled, caring 


 
involvement of our 

collaborative projects undertaken in our Learning Garden and the broader community.Students in need of specialized 
inst
ruction are mainstreamed as much as possible into the general education setting per their IEP goals. The Special 
Education Teacher works collaboratively with the general education teachers to plan instructional opportunities aligned 
with the core curriculu
m. Modifications are made to make the core curriculum accessible to students. In addition, as 
appropriate, our special education students attend an Extended School Year (ESY) program in the summer to help maintain 
the knowledge learned during the regular s
chool year. The Foster Youth Liaison has welcome meetings with foster youth 
to ensure they have all the necessary resources to be successful.
 
 
Mission Statement:
 
"Orangewood Elementary is dedicated to developing globally
-
minded problem solvers. We 
enhance learning by inspiring 
students to inquire through transdisciplinary units while empowering them to take action using the attributes of the 
Learner Profile."

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are cle
an, safe, and functional through proper facilities 

maintenance and campus improvements ensure facilities remain up to date and provide adequa
te space for students and 
staff. In summer 2019, the district added two new portables. The district conducted a wireless upgrade and network 
upgrade (network cabinets, switches, and battery backups) by December 2019. Network improvements and new 
telephone 
systems are anticipated to be installed by the summer of 2020. District maintenance and site custodial staff 
ensure that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good condition are completed in a timely manner.  Every morning, 
the custodian inspects fac
ilities for safety hazards or other conditions that need attention prior to students and staff 
entering school grounds. One day
-
custodian and one evening custodian are assigned to Orangewood Elementary School. 
The day custodian is responsible for: Cafeteri
a setup/cleanup, Light grounds keeping, and Restroom cleaning
--
Restrooms 
are checked regularly throughout the day for cleanliness and subsequently cleaned as needed. The evening custodian is 
responsible for: Classroom cleaning, Office area cleaning, and Re
stroom cleaning. The principal communicates with 
custodial staff daily concerning maintenance and school safety issues.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
Orangewood Elementary School receives federal and state categorical funding for special programs, including the 
following:
 
 
English Learners: English Learners (EL), identified by home language 
surveys and results of their English Language 
Proficiency Assessment for California (ELPAC), participate in 30 minutes of English Language Development (ELD) daily, in 
addition to structured English immersion. Teachers employ SDAIE (Specially Designed Acade
mic Instruction in English) 
strategies throughout the day to assist English Learners in accessing the curriculum.
 
 
Special Education:  Students with special needs are accommodated with a variety of options and in the least restrictive 
environment (LRE).  S
tudents are identified through the testing process, and an Individualized Education Plan is created 
for each qualifying student.  Students are supported through their IEPs and any other designated instructional services 
they require such as speech and lang
uage services, occupational therapy, DIS counseling, assistive technology, adapted 
physical education, etc.  Students in need of specialized instruction are mainstreamed as much as possible into the general 
education setting per their IEP goals. The specia
l education teachers work collaboratively with the general education 
teachers to plan instructional opportunities aligned with the core curriculum.  The IB curriculum allows students to express 
their learning through different modalities.  Lunchtime social
 
skills support is provided for students during lunch by the 
principal and TOSA.
 
 
Foster Youth and Homeless:  After a foster youth or homeless student enrolls, our liaison meets with the family as soon 
as possible to welcome them and provide support.  Thes
e students are monitored monthly to ensure their success.  
Counseling, school supplies, and outside resources are a few areas in which we support these students.  Moreover, the 
TOSA and principal monitor these students' academic progress and social
-
emotion
al needs and recommends intervention 
as needed to help address any achievement gaps.  Lunchtime social skills support is provided for students during lunch by 
the principal and TOSA.
 
 
Intervention: Additional support is provided to students who are not yet
 
meeting grade
-
level standards. In addition to 
small group instruction during the regular school day, intensive reading intervention is provided by reading teachers.  A 
hands
-
on approach for struggling readers is provided 4 times a week in the reading room
.

Expo.
 
 
10%

the summer.  Title 1 funds are provided for parental involvement.  In addition, our PTA works tirelessly to raise funds for 
our school throu
gh fundraisers and membership dues.  These funds have been used to support student field trips and 
assemblies for our students among other gifts.  Teachers may also apply for classroom grants through the Rotary Club and 
Garden Grants.
