By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Midland Elementary School, a No Excuses University, we believe it is our moral imperative to prepare our students to 
become productive members of our global society.
 
 
The vision of college and career readiness has become a living
, 
breathing facet of all that we believe for children, and plays a significant role in our school culture.
 
 
College and career 
readiness is the belief that we must prepare all students to have a full range of post
-
secondary education and training 
options a
vailable to them after high school.
 
 
The skill set for a successful future mirrors the skill set required to gain 
entrance into college; and at the elementary school level, this vision translates to working toward ensuring that each 
student meets and/or ex
ceeds proficiency of grade level standards through our organization through six systems to include 
Universal Culture of Achievement, Standards Alignment, Collaboration, Assessment, and Data Analysis.
 
 
Some of the 
college and career readiness activities at 
this No Excuses University include, but are not limited to:
 
 
wearing college 
clothing every Friday to set the tone for a great week of academic learning; adopting a four
-
year college or university in 



 
 
Midland Elementary School, home of the Rattlers, is the oldest school in the Po
way Unified School District and was 
established in 1925.  We moved into a new facility in March, 2006.  We serve approximately 630 kindergarten through 
fifth grade students from the east side of the Poway Unified School District, which is located in northe
rn San Diego County. 
One of the most notable features of our instructional program is the attention we devote to each student through SMART 
Goal data analysis, and the intensive array of targeted interventions which we implement to address student needs.  
These 
targeted interventions include, but are not limited to:  IMPACT teachers pulling small groups of students to provide 
targeted support based on formative assessment data;  daily targeted instruction English Learners; cross
-
age tutors; 
counseling; and 
after school programs. Midland is proud to be the 100th school in the nation to be inducted into the No 
Excuses University (NEU) Network.  The NEU Network is an organization made up of over 150 schools in 22 states serving 
over 70,000 students, most of who
m live at or below the poverty line, whose passion is to promote college readiness to 
all students and in doing so change the cycle of poverty for generations to come.
 
 
Our student population is composed of children from richly diverse cultural, ethnic, li
nguistic, religious, and socioeconomic 
backgrounds. Approximately 40% of our students qualify for free/reduced meals, and Title I support. Our racial/ethnic 
student population breaks down in the following way: 3% African
-
American, 7% Asian, 4% Filipino, 32
% Hispanic, 50% 
Caucasian, and 3% other.  English Learners (ELs) comprise roughly 35% of our student population. There are more than 20 
different languages represented on our campus, with Spanish being the most predominant behind English. Our Spanish 
speak
ing population has risen steadily over the past few years, and our EL population has more than doubled over the last 
15 years.  We have made accommodations and modifications in our teaching in order to provide instruction that aligns 
with our EL students' 
unique needs, and we have bridged our home
-
school communication with our Spanish
-
speaking 
families through the addition of a bilingual parent liaison.

Parents and community members volunteer in classrooms and throughout the school on a daily basis. Parent
 
representatives are involved in goal and budget development through our School Site Council.  We are fortunate to have 
two very active and supportive parent organizations at Midland 
-
 
our Parent Teacher Association (PTA) and the Midland 
Educational Founda
tion (MEF) 
-
 
both of whom offer many opportunities for parents to become involved in fundraising 
events to support school programs.
 
 
At Midland we offer a variety of options to assist parents in cultivating a strong home
-
school partnership. These options i
nclude, but are not limited to: before and after school child care; on
-
site parenting 
classes; monthly newsletters; family
-
fun events, and numerous Family Nights centered on academics, cultural diversity, 
and building community.
 
 
Academic achievement for e

scores demonstrate that we have made excellent progress toward our vision. The majority of Midland students 
demonstrated proficiency on the California State Standar
ds in both Math and English/Language Arts. Moving forward in 
the new federal and state standards and blended learning environments, our emphasis will be focused on helping students 
know their strengths, interests, and passions 
-
 
to continue to move student
s toward a promising future. We believe our 
vision will be achieved through a strong implementation of the California State Standards and targeted instruction that 
engages all students in relevant and meaningful learning experiences that develop habits of 
mind that will ensure future 
success for all students.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Poway Unified School District ensures that students attend clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the 
District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each of its schools is maintained in good repair.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the hig
hest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and well maintained.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A night cus
todial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms and offices daily.  
The district has adopted cleaning standards for all schools.  A summary of these standards is available at the district offic
es.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

several committees, including but not limited to our: School Site Council, English Learner Advisory Committee, Parent 
Teacher Association, and the Midland Educatio
nal Foundation.  In addition, our parents serve as Midland representatives

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Midland places strong emphasis on the safety of all students and staff. The campus is exceptionally secure during school 
hours.  Visitors to the school must enter through the main office, sign in through a compute
r system where they must 
declare the location being visited, and wear a  badge/sticker if they wish to enter our campus. Security chimes have been 
added to the office and Extended Student Services (ESS) buildings. Disaster drills are planned throughout the
 
year, where 
a different drill is conducted so that every staff member and student is aware of the procedures for each situation to 
include evacuation, earthquake procedures, lockdown processes, active shooter and disaster preparation with student 
release 
simulations. Students consecutively learn and practice drills for simulations of fire, earthquakes, lock
-
down, 
shelter
-
in
-
place and disasters. The School Safety Plan is reviewed and updated regularly, and annual training procedures 
are provided to staff. M
aintenance staff work with a scheduled preventive program to offset costly repairs. Extended 
Student Services is available to students for before and after school childcare. We have established a classroom on campus 
named the Student Center, staffed with a
dults to support the social and/or emotional needs of students and to provide 
students more options to develop their own ability to manage feelings. A full time counselor and part time student services 
assistant provided lessons on social and peer skills t
hrough individual or small group support, and offer supervised 
alternative activities during recess and lunchtimes.
 
 
Updates to our site security include shade screens added to our back 
perimeter fence that separates our campus to neighboring homes to offe
r more privacy to our students while on our 
playground throughout the day.

Research supports the unquestionable effects professional learning has on building teacher capacity, which results in 
positively impacting student learning. All teaching staff are afforded the opportunity to participate in district and site 
sponsored profe
ssional development.  Workshops within the Teaching and Learning Cooperative are presented in a 
semester or year
-
long series and support a wide variety of professional development in alignment and support of 
California State Standards. These include the us
e of effective instructional strategies, implementing the use of technology 
in teaching and learning, critical reading, writing and mathematics strategies, effective use of assessments, positive 
discipline in
-
services, and multicultural training. Teachers 
and administrators are actively involved in professional 
development activities at the school, district, state, and national level. The Poway Professional Assistance Program (PPAP) 
provides support for new teachers. Teachers are encouraged to participate i
n the National Board Certification process and 
are recognized by the Poway Unified School District when they earn NBCT status.
 
 
Examples of professional development 
provided to our staff include Teaching with Love & Logic, Student Engagement Strategies, Pe
rsonalized Learning, and 
Zones of Regulation.
