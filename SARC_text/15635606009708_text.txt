By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and 
Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Year and month in which data were collected:
 
August 19, 2019
 
 
Lamont School District sets a high priority on ensuring that sufficient and current textbooks and materials are available to 

nstructional program and provides students with their own textbooks in the core subject areas. 
Lamont School District held a Public Hearing on November, 2016, and determined that each school within the district has 
sufficient and good quality textbooks or 
instructional materials, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of 
California.
 
 
All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional 
materials, or both, in core subjects for use
 
in the classroom and to take home. All textbooks and instructional materials 
used within the district are aligned with the California Common Core State Standards and have been approved by the 
Board of Trustees. Textbooks and supplementary materials are ad
opted according to a cycle developed by the California 
Department of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available.
 
 
Supplementary materials provide enrichment and extension activities, while instructional techniques and str
ategies are 
utilized in all grade levels. We are also using the Accelerated Math, Accelerated Reading, Common Core Standards 
Plus,programs in our classrooms as needed. Textbooks continue to be purchased on a yearly basis according to the 
adoption cycle and
 
grade level needs. The table displays information collected in August 2017 about the quality, currency, 
and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Our school is a source of pride within our community. In order to facilitate learning in a safe environment: Our 24 
classrooms are always clean and are kept in outstanding condition.
 
 
A maintenance supervisor and four maintenance staff members keep our caf
eteria and classroom facilities well
-
maintained. Two maintenance staff members work during the day to take care of daily needs and two work in the evenings 
to ensure clean classrooms for the subsequent school day.
 
 
Our school is painted regularly and graff
iti is removed immediately for all areas.
 
 
Our school is fully fenced and gates are locked during school and evening to ensure a safe and orderly campus. In addition; 
all classrooms are locked during instructional time.  All visitors must sign in at the of
fice and wear Roadrunner Name Tags 
to identify them as authorized visitors. Yard duty staff monitors student behavior before school and at lunch, at times 
assisted by parent volunteers. Teachers also supervise students at recess and after school to ensure 
campus safety.
 
 
Student safety on the bus is always a concern. School bus safety is monitored by our bus drivers, and tickets are issued to 
students who do not follow the rules for safety. Depending on the infraction, parents are notified and students may 
receive 
a warning and be removed from the bus for 10 days or permanently.
 
 
After school safety is also provided via our After School Program. Our After School Program runs until 6 p.m. and is staffed 
by Boys and Girls trained tutors and supported by a 
lead teacher and an Academic Interventions Coach.
 
 
Myrtle Avenue takes pride in supporting students in a safe and orderly environment. An interruption to the safe 
environment is addressed quickly. Our Safe School Plan is re
-
written/edited and updated every
 
year. We also have a 
behavior specialist who works with students who are potential behavioral risks to the overall positive social environment 
of our students.   The motto at our school is to prevent escalation of student to student conflict before they a
rise.  We 
implement the PBIS framework to ensure and provide positive reinforcement for our students.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic

students and programs. Parents help plan and evaluate programs and school  
improvements. They elect School Site 
Council and English Language Advisory Committee representatives. Parents review curriculum improvement plans and 
supplemental material to support improvements. Programs that help children improve regular school attendan
ce and 
prepare for high school are important concerns to parents and are discussed at parent meetings. Throughout the year 
parents are given the opportunity to attend the various academic, music and athletic assemblies as we recognize student 
progress and 
participation.
 
 
Parents are invited to attend different activities throughout the school year.  Five times a year, parents are invited to hav
e 
coffee and pastries with the principal in an informal setting that is parent
-
oriented. Each meeting has a specifi
c theme 
that is addressed depending on the community and student needs but community members are encouraged to discuss 
any concerns or ideas that may arise. Parents are always invited to help in our classrooms, with playground supervision, 
fund raising act
ivities or athletic events and practices.
 
 
Parent Educational Nights are tailored to assist parents in helping their students obtain academic success. These meetings 
are offered  at least four times during the school year. The meetings focus on core subjec
ts such as language arts and math 
as well as discipline and emergency guidelines and the end of the year state assessment. Through these meetings parents 
gain expertise on how to better assist their students at home. AVID Walkthroughs help parents to see h
ow these strategies 
are implemented in the classrooms.
 
 
Parents, staff and community members are active participants in developing and monitoring our action plan to improve 
our school. Over 90% of our parents attend Parent/Teacher Conferences. Parents atte
nd student programs and support 
fund raisers. Through these activities, parents support their children and help improve the quality of curriculum and 
instruction in our school.

The district provides opportunities for professional development throughout the school year. For the past three years the 
district has provided two all
-
day staff development days each year. Sessions can go for a full day covering topics such as 
transition 
to Common Core and Professional Learning Communities to specific learning strategies. In recent years, the 
district has been emphasizing professional development on educational technology and reading foundational skills.  In 
addition, this year the distric
t is providing an overview of ELD standards in relation to Designated/Integrated Time.
 
 
The need for targeted staff development in reading became evident after  reviewing district benchmarks and ELPAC 
reading data.   We have been providing reading staff de
velopment throughout the year with an emphasis on English 
Language Development.   Also, throughout the year, teachers are encouraged to attend workshops addressing areas such 
as math and reading strategies, special education, GATE and AVID. These professio
nal developments include two
-
Way 
conferences, CABE conferences, SST overview training, PBIS Trainings and school visits, LETRS training, Numbers, (Math), 
training, NGSS overview, and AVID Summer Institute. This is supported by our 
School Plan
 
for Student A
chievement (SPSA). 
Our para
-
professionals are also encouraged to attend workshops or in
-
services that will provide them with additional 
support and strategies.  Our staff is supported in the implementation of strategies by in
-
class coaching, teacher
-
princi
pal 
meetings and data of student performance.
 
 
Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) planning time is held bi
-
monthly to analyze data, plan instruction/focus 
calendars, monitor student progress and evaluate program effectiveness in teaching the Language
 
Arts, ELD, and 
Mathematics standards. The district instituted Professional Learning Communities with teams of teachers who have the 
same students. Teams meet at least once a week for an hour to support each other and collaborate about test scores, 
student
 
achievement, instructional practices, etc. The school has already experience much success with this system.
