School Description
 
Principal's Message
 

of the William Orr staff, it gives me pleasure to share information with our parents and community 

t, materials, and facilities.
 
 
William Orr Elementary is located in Norwalk and has approximately 400 students attending 
transitional kindergarten through fifth grade.  Most of our students will continue their education 
at Lakeside Middle School, also a pa
rt of Little Lake City School District.  We are a community school, 
relying on parent, community, and local business support to ensure our students receive a top 
notch education and support services.  Parent involvement is a priority at Orr as evidenced in
 
our 
numerous opportunities for parents, including our Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), School Site 
Council (SSC), English Learners Advisory Committee (ELAC), and many other school events.  Based 
on a 2018
-
2019 parent survey, 96% of our parents were sati
sfied with William Orr.
 
 
William Orr Elementary is committed to the belief that every student will learn. The mission of 
William Orr Elementary School as a learning community, in partnership with families, is to develop 
all children into 
responsible, academically prepared citizens through the efforts of a skilled staff 
implementing a rigorous curriculum, rich in the diversity of a constantly changing world.  We strive 
to provide a positive learning environment that supports high expectatio
ns for student 
achievement and behavior. A balanced educational program is implemented, which recognizes the 
need for growth in academic, social, physical, and technological skills. At William Orr, we use 
evidence based teaching strategies to improve the r
eading, writing, and math skills of all students.
 
 
William Orr has been recognized numerous times both at the state and national level for academic 
excellence. In 2010, Orr was the first school within the Little Lake City School District to be 
recognized a
s a National Blue Ribbon School.  Moreover, William Orr was also recognized in 2010 
as a California Distinguished School and a Title 1 Achieving School.  We have also been recognized 
as a California Business for Education Excellence Star School multiple ti
mes (2009, 2010, 2012, 
2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018).  In addition, William Orr was named a 2016 Gold Ribbon 
School and a Title I Academic Achieving School.  Most recently, Orr was recognized by the California 
PBIS Coalition with a Silver Level I
mplementation Award for our fidelity in implementing Tier 1 of 
the PBIS framework in both 2018 and 2019.  It is with great pride that Orr has accepted these 
recognitions and has continued to improve student achievement.
 
 
In our longstanding tradition of ex
cellence, we maintain our commitment to students, parents, 
community members, and staff to provide the best educational experience possible. We renew this 
commitment annually in hopes that together we will continue to improve our effectiveness in 
educating
 
our students and preparing them to become productive citizens.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
William Orr Elementary School has 22 regular classrooms, 4 portable classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library, and an admini
stration building. The 
main campus was 
constructed in 1955. Additions were constructed in 2000. Our facilities are in good working condition and accommodate our stu
dent 
population. Our office building was completely restored following a fire. Outdoor lighting and wireless internet was placed t
h
roughout campus.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the
 
Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings:
 
their structural integrity, electrical systems, heating and ventilation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good
 
repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment
 
identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for this assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the si

We have many ways you can get involved at William Orr.
 
 
1.
 
Become a PTO member.  PTO is responsible for many wonderful student programs at Orr.  Some examples include transportation fo
r field trips, 
our Spring C
arnival, Muffins with Mom, Donuts with Dads, and 5th grade end of the year activities to name just a few.  We are always look
ing 
for parents to join our PTO Board, chair a committee, or simply come and volunteer at some of our many events.  Meetings are 
he
ld monthly 
and are open to the public, so come and join in!
 
 
2.
 
Other important parent groups are our School Site Council (SSC) and English Learners Advisory Committee (ELAC).  These groups
 
are comprised 
of school staff and parents.  We meet as one unit a min
imum of five times during the year to discuss important school policies and procedures 
as well as our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement.  All members are nominated and elected for a two year term, however, our meetings are 
always open to the public.
 
 
3.
 
We 
offer different parent and community events throughout the year in an effort to educate our parents in ways that will help to
 
increase 
student achievement and well being as well as to foster a positive relationship with our community.  The topics/themes of
 
these events change 
yearly depending on the needs of our community and students.  Flyers and telephone notifications are sent home in advance to 
publicize these 
events.  These events are made possible through Supplemental Concentration LCAP funds.
 
 
4.
 
In con
junction with PTO, we also host a Coffee Club each month.  This is a chance for parents to come and volunteer their time to h
elp teachers 
prepare materials (i.e. stapling, cutting, etc.) for the classroom.  It is also a chance for the community to get to k
now each other and for PTO to 
share upcoming events and news.  As a sign of appreciation, snacks are provided by the school staff.  Flyers are sent home in
 
advance to 
publicize these dates.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension
 
rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The principal, teachers, and supervisory staff monitor the school grounds before, during, and after school. We follow a close
d campus policy at all time
s 

 
have monthly fire drills as well 
as earthquake and lock down drills throughout the year.
 
 
We revise our School Safety Plan annua
lly; it was last updated September 2019. The plan includes procedures for emergencies, entering and exiting the 
school, child
-
abuse reporting, sexual harassment policy, dress code, and school discipline.   William Orr implements Positive Behavioral In
terve
ntions and 
Supports (PBIS) to reinforce student behavior and reduce school suspensions.  School and community resources, such as our ele
mentary counselor, 
Turning Point trainees, and a partnership with The Whole Child, allow us to support students emotiona
lly and socially.   Based on our 2018
-
2019 parent 
survey, 96% of parents agreed that the school
-
wide discipline policy was effective and 96% of parents acknowledged that the school provides a safe 
environment for students.  Moreover, 92% of fifth grade stu
dents taking our Healthy Kids Survey reported that they feel safe at school.
 
 
Our School Safety Plan also includes information regarding our anti
-
bullying program.  All school staff, both certificated and classified, have been trained 
in our "No Bully" pro
gram  and students have been taught the definition of bullying, the difference between bullying and conflict, and strategies 
to stop 
bullying.  William Orr's "No Bully" program includes four levels with the goal being to stop bullying at the lowest level o
f our program.  At the first level, 
all staff and students have been trained to prevent and interrupt any instances of bullying that are observed.  The second le
vel includes a staff member 
checking in with the target and notifying a trained Solution Coach 
and the principal. In the third level, a  Solution Team may be convened and/or 
progressive discipline may be implemented.  Lastly, an Empathy Building Action Plan may be developed and implemented.  Our an
ti
-
bullying program is 
included in detail on our sch
ool's website, williamorr.llcsd.net.

Teachers take some time 
each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach.   A portion of our LCAP 
7 
funds are set aside to allow grade level teams to meet over the course of the school year to collaborate on English Language 
Arts
 
and Math units of study, 
pacing guides, and assessments that would support student achievement and prepare students for the SBAC.  Necessary supplemen
tary materials and 
resources were identified and purchased to support the units of study.  District coach
es and TOSAs are available to provide assistance and support for 
teachers in the areas of ELA, math, science, and technology, including grade level specific professional development and vert
ical articulation in Math.  In 
addition to multiple opportunities 
of professional development offered by the district (i.e. Integrated ELD, Thinking Maps, and ongoing training for our 
Student Achievement Leadership Team (SALT) and PBIS team).  LCAP 7 also funds select teachers to attend outside professional 
conferences. 
 
Newly 
acquired knowledge and teaching strategies from these conferences are shared with staff at the school site.  At the site leve
l, professional development 
is conducted as needed through site staff meetings and data reflection sessions.  In particular,
 
in the 2019
-
2020 school year, staff were trained in close 
reading strategies, guided reading, and strategies to solve math application problems.   In addition, every elementary teache
r received two days of 
training on Next Generation Science Standards thr
ough UCLA Science Project funded by the district.

Types of Services Funded
 
The Little Lake City School District provides additional services for students using federal funds (Title I, Title III, Title
 
IV) and LCAP funds.  Title I funds are 
primarily used to support all students using a Response to Intervention (RtI) model.  At th
e elementary sites, Interventionists are funded to provide 
differentiated instruction to meet the needs of all learners within the RtI model in ELA and mathematics during the school da
y.  At the middle schools, 
Interventionists monitor student academic pro
gress and determine placement for intervention based on student needs.  Title I funds are also used to 
support parent involvement at both the site and district level.  Title III is used to provide supplemental services to all En
glish Learners including add
itional 
tutoring beyond the school day, and professional development for EL Coordinators.  Title IV funds provide students with a wel
l
-
rounded education and 
supports using phenomena in NGSS
-
designed lessons through the creation of NGSS kits.  In addition, 
these funds support safe and healthy students 
through the implementation of a social emotional learning program, Second Step, which is a proactive approach to building ess
ential social and behavioral 
skills.  LCAP Funds are used to supplement services for 
English learners, low income students, and homeless/foster students.  Some actions and services 
include additional counselors, professional development for teachers, supplemental materials, parent engagement opportunities
, and student 
motivation activities
.
