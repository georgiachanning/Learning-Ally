By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Safety Plan is revised and updated annually, with the most recent revision in January 2020. The 
school's disaster 
preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster, including a comprehensive crisis 
plan. Fire Drills, lockdown, earthquake drills, and bus evacuation are practiced routinely.
 
 
To ensure student safe
ty, staff members supervise students at all times before and after school and during recesses and 
lunch. Staff members are equipped with walkie
-
talkies to be able to inform the office of any emergency.
 
 
All visitors to the campus are required to check in a
t the school office and must wear the proper identification badge at 
all times.  Selma Unified utilizes a digital visitor management system titled Raptor Technologies, which screens for all 
visitors, including sex offenders, custody issues, and banned visi
tors. The system scans the visitor's ID card to monitor who 
is in the building and notes purpose for the visit, location of the visit, and who the visitor is visiting.

Selma Unified utilizes SPRIGEO at every school site. SPRIGEO is an electronic platform 
that gives students and their parents 
the tool to report bullying and other safety concerns anonymously through a link on the school website. All students 
should feel safe at school and in their community. This program provides children and parents a confi
dential reporting 
option, in addition to our open
-
door policy to report concerns of bullying. SPRIGEO notifies administrators through emails 
and texts to alert them of reported incidents. This program also stores the incident report in a secure online data
base, 
which provides school organizations with an efficient method of tracking and analyzing reports.
 
 
Garfield students have received antibullying support training via an assembly titled Boxout Bullying, which also included a 
student survey 
component.
 
 
Statistics show that nearly 75% of students experience bullying on a daily basis, and about 65% of bullying incidents go 
unreported. 160,000 students in America skip school on a daily basis because they don't feel safe. We continue to partner 
w
ith our district and community to address bullying. Garfield implements a bully prevention curriculum, Expect Respect. 
We teach and review school
-
wide behavior expectations, provide student and staff training, and provide anti
-
bullying 
assemblies to contin
ue to support our students and staff in this area.

Selma Unified has focused on developing the four PLC Pillars, Vision, Mission, Values, and Goals, for the past five years.  
Throughout this process, site administration has received training and participated in development of the district vision, 
mission, and values.  Site administrators then lead this process at the site level to develop site vision, mission, and value
s. 
For t
he 2018
-
2019 school year, we have relaunched our instructional leadership teams (ILTs) to continue this work, as 
Teacher Leaders connect this visionary work back to the classrooms through professional learning communities.  Selma 
Unified School District su
pports and builds teacher capacity throughout the year through various structures.  Our primary 
Professional Learning support is through site
-
based, weekly Professional Learning Communities, where grade level/spans 
of teachers collaborate for an hour weekl
y during the school day. Teachers work to address the 4  PLC questions: What do 
we expect our students to learn?  How will we know each student has learned it? How will we respond when some 
students have not learned it?  How can we extend and enrich the le
arning for students who have demonstrated 
proficiency? Teachers review their teacher work and student work, then collectively share knowledge, struggles, and 
solutions to answer these four questions in the areas of social, emotional, and academic learning.
  
Formative and 
summative data are used to monitor progress toward student, teacher, and site goals and adjustments are made as 
needed.
 
 
The 2019
-
2020 PLC Pillar Focus is Goals, as we continue to build coherence across our campus and district in this work.
  
We continue to lead this work through our instructional leadership teams/professional learning communities.  Our site
-
based academic coaching model allows for job
-
embedded professional learning for both administration and teachers.  
Garfield teachers hav
e committed to NGSS training from 2018
-
2020. We have added a Math intervention teacher through 
a push
-
in model, allowing for students services as well as professional learning for our teachers through collaboration with 
our math expert. Our Math Interventi
onist and site Academic Coach have provided site
-
based professional learning 
sessions on the following topics: Number Talks, Guided Reading, and "Who's Doing the Work?".  Support is provided to 
teachers through weekly professional learning community design
ated time, after school professional learning sessions, 
coaching support, peer observations, teacher presentations, objective setting conferences with administration and 
progress checks, and via training and dissemination of information by instructional le
adership teams.
 
 
In addition, Selma Unified School District supports and builds teacher capacity throughout the year through a Site Based 
Coaching model.  This model allows for job embedded Professional learning by implementing the tenets of the Profession
al 
Learning Community framework. The district maintains a ELA/ELD, Math and Science coaching team that in turn support 
and provide instructional support for our site level coaching team. In collaboration with both teams, professional learning 
for teachers 
is provided to assist all students in achieving the State academic standards, with an emphasis on addressing 
and supporting  student groups requiring additional resources; groups such as Foster Youth, English Learners, and 
Students 
with Disabilities.
 
 
The 
District also provides all teachers with three professional learning days throughout the year.  These are non
-
student 
days that are planned and facilitated by site leaders and site coaches.  For the last couple of years, these days focus on 
allowing teache
rs time for instructional planning as they apply to the California Standards for the Teacher Profession 
(CSTPs 3, 4, & 5).
