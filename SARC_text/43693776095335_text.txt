By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability R
eport 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accounta
bility Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SA
RC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the L
CFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the sch
ool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains addition
al information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enroll
ments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public l
ocations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a work
station, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General: The district places a strong emphasis on ensuring that all schools are safe, clean, environmentally friendly, 
mechanically functional and
 
inviting for stud
ents, staff members, and the community. To assist in this effort, the district 
utilizes Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC and local operations department developed 
inspection survey methods to keep f
acilities in compl
iance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. The 
district regularly inspects and reviews the condition of the school facilities and surrounding grounds. The district places 
the highest priority on those safeguards that 
impact the fire, l
ife and safety protection of the students, staff, and school 
buildings. Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students 
are provided with a clean, safe, and functional learnin
g environment.
 
 
Ag
e of School Buildings: Brooktree was opened in 1975. This school has 22 regular classrooms, a multipurpose room, a 
library, and an administration building. In addition to the main building, there are six portable classrooms that have 
been 
added to accommod
ate class size reduction and instructional programs for the Santa Clara County Office of Education.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working o
rder are completed in 
a timely manner. A work order system process is used to ensure efficient service and 

in good working order. Inte
rior and exterior ligh
ting upgrades were completed through Prop. 39 initiatives in identified 
areas throughout the campus.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule: The district has developed cleaning standards and schedules for all schools in the district. 
A summar
y of these standards a
nd schedules is available at the school or the Maintenance & Operations office. The 
principal, with the guidance of the maintenance supervisor works daily with the custodial team to ensure that the cleaning 
standards are met, and that
 
classrooms, restrooms
, and campus grounds are kept clean, safe, and well
-
maintained.
 
 
Modernization Projects: During the 2018 summer period, local bond funds (Measure L) were used to complete various 
modernization projects. These projects included install
ation of new flooring,
 
replacement classroom furniture, painting of 
identified interior spaces throughout the campus, installation of new AV equipment and the construction of a Flexible 
Instructional Space. All work described was completed by the end of th
e 2018/19 school year.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to th
e State priorit
y: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education popula
tion and the 
Ca
lifornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are ali
gned with alter
nate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the 
requirements fo
r entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Individual school sites offer Supplemental Instruction (SI) to students who are below grade level. It is up to 
each individual 
school sit e to identify the students who need extra support based upon district benchmarks or te
acher recommendations. 
Each school site selects certificated and classified staff to teach these SI classes, usually after school (1 

 
3 days a
 
week). 
Each school also identifies the curriculum that will be used. The majority of the school sites select com

programs w here students can work independently at their current academic level. Some schools provide this time to 
receive help on
 
their homework.

Professional Development this school year occurred on many different levels 

 
before school started (summer of 2019) 
and ongoing 
throughout the 2019 

 
2020 sc
hool year.  The district office working with our site principals and curriculum 
leadership teams developed the scope/sequence of the professional development.  Leadership teams reviewed student 
data produced from benchmark test
s, ELPAC, and SBAC data, as w
ell as staff feedback when developing the scope and 
sequence.
 
 
At the beginning of the school year, all certificated and classified staff participated in two days of professional 
development aligned to their instructional role 
and needs.  TK

5 teachers rec
eived training on providing effective Tier 1 
instruction in math and ELA.  Special education staff, social workers and psychologists received training on topics pertinent
 
to their needs such as All Learning is Social Emotional,
 
TCI De

Escalation, Instructi
onal Scaffolding to Assist and Support 
Student , and Data Collection and Behavior Management.  Middle school staff received specialized training related to the 
content they teach, that focused on the social emotional element of
 
learning as well as recently
 
adopted curriculum.  All 
middle school teachers participated in a workshop on understanding gender.  Training for new teachers focused on 

ipated in some sessions with 
their 
certificated colleagues in order to have the opportunity to collaborate while learning.  They also attended other sessions 
designed to meet their specific professional needs.
 
 
During the school year middle school, science
 
teachers were released up to
 
three days to collaborate on implementation 
of the new science program.  Middle school math and writing teachers scored and/or analyze student benchmarks during 
release days for each grade.  7th grade science teachers were rel

Througho
ut the school year, we offered monthly professional development sessions in which all teachers participated (1.5 
hours on 10 early release Thursday afternoons).  Principals and district office administrators chose the topics fo
r the 2019
-
2020 school year i
n alignment with the District focus on developing a multi
-
tiered system of support.
 
 
The Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL) program was implemented at six of our ten elementary schools in grades TK
-
3.  The schools included 
were Cherrywood, Laneview, Su
mmerdale, Brooktree, Toyon and Vinci Park.   Teachers in the first 
two years of implementation received three two
-
day training modules each followed by a day of unit planning.  Teachers 
in the third and fourth year of implement
ation participated in three d
ays of unit planning.  Contracted SEAL experts 
provided the module training sessions and three district instructional coaches facilitated the follow up planning PD 
sessions.  Teachers were released from their classrooms for all
 
of these PD days.
 
 
Four inst
ructional coaches provided BTSA induction training for all teachers who qualified to receive BTSA training and 
support. Additionally, BUSD teachers provide PAR assistance to teachers who are in need of additional assistance.  A
ll 
teachers have access to an
 
instructional coach so that they can receive follow up support on implementing new learning 
attended through professional development.
 
 
An MTSS committee and Differentiated Assistance Team received 3
-
5 days of training on chan
ge management facilitated 
by 
WestEd and the Santa Clara County Office of Education.  Some members also participated in 3 training sessions of 
equity.  Team members then trained principals during monthly professional development meetings.   The focus of bot
h 
teams aligned with the dist
rict goal of developing multi
-
tiered systems of support at each site.
