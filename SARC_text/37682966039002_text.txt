By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Built in 1960, Pomerado Elementary School has proudly served generations of Poway families. The school currently serves 
approximately 400 students in transitional 
kindergarten
 
through fifth grade, in addition to one State
-
funded 6
-
hour 
preschool
 
class. 
 
Two Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) preschool classes service special education preschool students and 
typical peers, along with two Academic ASD classes that serve TK
-
 
5th grades. Pomerado Elementary is a whole
-
school 
Federally Funded Title 1 scho
ol.
 
 
 
Pomerado is proud to be a part of the nation
-
wide No Excuses University network.
 
 
We believe in setting high expectations 
for each of our students and remain focused on creating a safe, supportive learning environment where all students can 
be succes
sful in meeting their goals. Staff and students see their learning through the lens of a growth mindset and learn 
to persevere through challenges.
 
 
All students have signed a pledge on display in our Multi
-
Purpose Room to Work Hard, 
Be Kind, and let No Exc
use stand in their way.
 
 
 
 
 
Staff is highly dedicated and passionate about using the very best teaching strategies and resources.
 
 
Staff collaborates 
on a regular basis within and between grade level teams, and as a whole staff.
 
 
Staff attends a variety of
 
district and site 
based professional development opportunities, and is eager to implement research
-
based programs that focus on specific 
student needs. Technology is used to support learning and student engagement, and staff is trained on how to best 
inco
rporate technology into their instruction.
 
 
 
Pomerado is part of a district Voyager program, which provides bi
-
weekly 
coaching support for teachers as they focus on personalizing learning for each student.
 
 
The blended learning that is 
occurring allows our
 
students to have voice and choice in how they learn, and how they show their learning.
 
 
We guide 
students in discovering their strengths, values, and interests to help them find their own best pathway to college and/or 
career.
  
 
 
 
We provide a wide array 
of academic support programs for children who require special assistance in mastering academic 
standards. Our Resource Specialist Program (RSP) provides specialized academic instruction, and two speech and language 
pathologists work with students with IEP 
speech and language goals.
 
 
Our English Language Learner program assists 
students who need extra support with language acquisition and educational support.
 
 
An ELL Instructional Aide is part of 
this program and works with small groups on targeted skills.
 
 
 
We also employ a part
-
time Spanish
-
speaking Bilingual Parent Liaison who provides translation for school documents and 
on
-
site translation services to support communication between teachers, staff, and parents.
 
 
 
 
Our academic support program also 
includes part
-
time trained Impact Teachers who work with groups of students on 
specific and targeted skills.
 
 
These groups are flexible, programs used are research
-
based, and data is tracked on a regular 
basis.
 
 
Our after 
 
 
school program
 
 
(Homework Club) extends the learning day for students in need of academic interventions, homework help and/or time 
on computers.

Challenges and higher level thinking activities are also in place for our students who are excelling and moving beyond 
proficiency.
 
 
These include our Math Olympiad Club and our Book Club; both focus on using critical thinking skills and more 
advanced problems and books.
 
 
In addition, students can be identified for our Gifted and Talented Educational Program 
(GATE) startin
g in second grade through our district qualification process.
  
 
 
For students who need some extra support with social/emotional needs, Pomerado has a counselor on site 5 days a week 
and a Student Services Aide. Both see small groups, meet with students one
 
on one, and teach classroom lessons on 
empathy, friendship, and other social skills.
 
 
We incorporate Restorative Justice Practices, along with strategies from the 
Positive Behavior Intervention System.
 
During our monthly Kind Cats lessons each student hea
rs and discusses the same 
book.
 
 
Books focus on kindness and allow us to have a common
 
 
language and strategies for solving problems with peers.
  
 
 
 
An emphasis on personalizing learning for students has resulted in the use of flexible seating, blended lea
rning, and 
innovative learning spaces.
 
 
These innovative learning spaces include our new Launch Lab, where students participate in 
lessons that
 
 
include coding and robotics, video production, research and marketing, and a Maker Space.
 
 
Activities are 
integ
rated with our Benchmark Language Arts themes and the RIASEC or Holland Code, so that students can discover 
strengths and interests within specific career areas.
 
 
We continue to build connections with our local middle and high 
school and career professiona
ls to enable students to see potential career pathways.
  
 
 
 
We take pride in creating a safe environment where students are engaged in using higher level thinking skills as they 
master California State Standards.
 
 
Our Wildcats help each other, show kindnes
s to others, persevere with school work, 
and are ready to take on any challenge as they prepare themselves for college and careers.
  
 
 
 
SITE NO EXCUSES UNIVERSITY (NEU) STATEMENT
 
 
 
Pomerado's staff believes that each of our Wildcats deserves a safe learnin
g environment that will empower and motivate 
him/her to achieve or move beyond proficiency.
 
 
Each staff member commits to providing this environment and will let 
No Excuse stand in our way.
 
 
Each day we focus on creating a culture of universal achievement 
and building exceptional 
systems that form a firm foundation for student learning.
 
 
We pledge to keep expectations high, hold each other 
accountable, and keep our students firmly on the path to college and career readiness.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The 
Poway Unified School District ensures that students attend clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each o
f its schools is maintained in good repair.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well main
tained.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and well maintained.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A night custodial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms and offices daily.  
The district has adopted cleaning standards for a
ll schools.  A summary of these standards is available at the district offices.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight
 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant co
gnitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or program

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Pomerado places strong emphasis on safety for students and staff. Emergency plans are reviewed frequently. Annual 
training on procedures and drills for various disaster scenarios
 
including earthquake, fire, lock down,
 
and bus evacuation 
are held every Augu
st, with follow up training during staff meetings throughout the school year as needed. Students and 
staff participate in monthly drills as required by PUSD.
 
 
Our Site Safety Plan contains both a physical and social climate 
goal to ensure we are meeting th
e varied needs of the whole child.
 
 
New goals are set each year and approved by our Site 
Safety Committee and School Site Council.
 
 
Current goals focus on safety options training and strengthening the social and 
emotional skills of our students. Our social
 
climate goal focused on the teaching of kindness and empathy with common 
language throughout the school. Each first Friday of the month, teachers deliver a Kind Cats lesson which focuses on social 
emotional skills.
 
 
 
Our school also works closely with our
 
School Resource Officer to assure that we are up
-
to
-
date with procedures such as 
lock
-
downs, and that we have all documents readily available.
 
 
Our SRO visits the school and is visible to students during 
visits.
  
 
 
Maintenance staff work with a scheduled 
preventive program to offset costly repairs and ensure student safety. The 
school has an up
-
to
-
date Asbestos Plan. Extended Student Services is available to students for before and after school 
childcare.
 
 
Our school is a closed campus, requiring visitors 
to check in at the main office and to display badges before entering the 
campus.
 
 
Ingress and egress are carefully monitored by staff.
 
 
Safety is our first priority.

Research supports the positive effects professional development has on increasing student learning. All staff is afforded 
the opportunity to participate in 
district and site sponsored professional development. Four full days and two partial days 
allow teachers and staff to continue to grow professionally and improve instruction.
 
 
Topics include the use of effective 
instructional strategies, CCSS implementatio
n in math and English Language Arts, implementing the use of technology in 
teaching and learning, critical reading, writing and mathematics strategies, effective use of assessments, positive disciplin
e 
in
-
services, Response to Intervention, and multicultur
al training. Staff meetings include time for professional learning, and 
staff participates in district planned training on Professional Growth Days.
 
 
Grade level teams meet regularly (before or 
after school and during site X
-
Ploration/Collaboration times) 
and focus on discussing and implementing best strategies for 
instruction and assessment, analyzing data, and meeting the needs of students.
 
 
Many teachers also take advantage of 
teacher led workshops (TLC's) throughout the school year.
 
 
Teachers and the ad
ministrator are encouraged to attend local 
conferences that focus on topics aligned with site and district goals, and then bring information back to the site to share 
with others (e.g. No Excuses University, Rehab Seminars, CABE Conference for ELL).
 
 
Pomer
ado also participates in the 
District's Voyager program, which brings bi
-
weekly coaching that focuses on blended learning and incorporating 
technology into student learning.
 
 
Staff have continued to implement No Excuses University work on campus. The desig
n 
and development of the Launch Lab places emphasis on student strengths, passions and interests, and gives all students 
an opportunity to explore possible career paths. Staff continues to work on personalizing learning experiences through 
voice and choice
 
in the classroom activities and seating. Pomerado educators strive to incorporate blended learning 
opportunities into learning experiences through the Voyager program, and through various 
online education
 
platforms.
 
 
 
 
The Poway Professional Assistance Program (PPAP) provides support for new teachers.
 
 
The Administrator and staff have 
been trained in the district's Teacher Professional Learning and Effectiveness System (TPLES), which allows for 
collaborative coaching to
 
guide professional learning.
 
 
Teachers are
 
 
also encouraged to participate in the National Board 
Certification process and are recognized by the Poway Unified School District when they earn NBCT status.
 
 
 
In 2018
-
19, our PLL (Professional Learning Leaders
) have continued to support site teachers in the focus on the California 
State Standards for English Language Arts, math, and Next Generation Science Standards.
