About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

We choose our textbooks f
rom lists that have already been approved by state education officials.  We use a district
-
wide adoption process that includes 
teachers, parents, students and administrators.
 
 
We have also reported about our textbooks called for by the Williams legislation
 
of 2004.  We report to the board in September and four times a year 
about the sufficiency of our textbooks as well as any complaints.  This online report shows whether we had a textbook for eac
h student in each core 
course during the 2017
-
18 school year a
nd whether those textbooks covered the California Content Standards.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Redding School District makes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. In 2016 the Distr
ict and the Board of Trustees 
authorized a Facilities Needs Assessment in order to identify our facility's needs over the next deca
de. To support the assessment effort, in 2018 the 
community passed a $28 million facilities bond to repair, renovate, and modernize all District schools. Since the bond passed
 
in 2018 the District has used 
the Facilities Needs Assessment to plan out the Bo
nd Initiatives.
 
 
In addition to the local bond, the District is seeking any State Modernization matching funds on a percentage basis, to assis
t with the expenditures for 
any major planned modernization work projects.
 
 
The District's Grounds and Maintenance
 
staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a 
timely manner, while the Operations staff ensures that the schools are kept clean. A work order process through a program cal
led "Akita Box" is
 
used to 
ensure efficient service; emergency repairs are given the highest priority. In addition to responding to emergency repairs, t
he maintenance department 

 
 
Bonny View Elementary school has a beautiful campus.  Bonny View was built in the early 1950s, expanded in the 1970s, and rem
odeled between 1995 
and 1997. In 1998, a 10,000 square foot addition was completed that houses seven classrooms, the school office,
 
and support space. Additional parking 
and a separate bus and car loops were also added. Our updated facilities include 17 classrooms; a learning lab; school psycho
logist, speech, health, 
technology, and music facilities; a new after school program room; a
 
multipurpose room with a cafeteria and stage; and a library. A walking/jogging path 
runs the perimeter of the playfield.
 
 
The school is staffed with one day, and one night custodian to provide a clean and hazard
-
free environment. The Principal, along with
 
the maintenance 
staff, works with the custodians to develop cleaning schedules to ensure clean and safe schools. The custodial staff follows 

standards, which are available at the District Office. In addition, on a monthly basis, th
e lead custodian uses a facility survey instrument developed by 
the Northern California Schools Insurance to evaluate the conditions of the school's facility. These reports are sent to the 
District Facilities Department 
who then does an annual evaluation f
or the site.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

are required to report to the school office before entering the campus. Emergency
 
procedures are posted in each room and monthly emergency 
evacuation, and neighborhood lockdown drills are practiced campus wide. Our video surveillance, scanning, and recording syste

organizational 
procedures required to minimize the effects of natural disasters, major accidents and incidents that can strike without warni
ng.

Evaluating and Improving Teachers
 
Bonny View teachers
 
are experienced and committed professionals. All of our teachers possess the appropriate credentials to teach in their design
ated 
subject areas. Administrators evaluate our teachers according to district protocol, which includes frequent observations and 
dialogue between teachers 
and administrators. We evaluate teachers each year during their first two years of employment. Beginning in their third year,
 
we evaluate teachers every 
three years.
 
 
Substitute Teachers
 
In order to maintain the stability and exce
llence of our instructional programs, we make every effort to hire a suitable number of the highest
-
caliber 
substitute teachers. Bonny View is fortunate to be able to attract and maintain qualified substitute teachers.

Types of Services Funded
 
Bonny View uses many funding sources to sustain the many intervention programs that support student learning with a focus on 
English Language Arts 
and Math.  Our school demographics allow us to receive Title 1 funding from the federal government to support
 
growth in ELA, Math, and a positive 
school climate. Our Parent Club also raises money to support our school. We have received donations from a variety of busines
ses and individuals, all of 
which we're using to upgrade school technology, beautify the campu
s, support field trips, and buy classroom materials. Bonny View is the recipient of an 
After School Education and Safety (ASES) grant, which funds our successful after school program.  Our current focus (2019
-
2020) is to create a "Culture 
of Readers".  We 
are doing this by building robust classroom libraries and increasing our school library selection.  We are also providing num
erous ways 
to allow students and staff to share the love of reading.
