Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

stimulating environment where students are actively involved in learning academics as well as positive values.  Students 
receive a standards

on the individual needs of the 
students.  In keeping with the District LCAP goal students at Oak Hill Elementary School will be challenged and supported 
to achieve academic success in a clean, safe environment.  Oak Hill Elementary School provides Title 1 
intervention for 
students in grades 1st
-
6th in English/Language Arts and Math.  In grades 4
-
6, GATE students are given the opportunity to 
attend after school  challenge activities.  This year GATE students were able to create videos for the SEVA Awards and
 
participate in the Nature Bowl.  Oak Hill Elementary supports the English Learners with a certificated teacher and two 
instructional assistants.  For those English Learners that have been in the school system for more than 5 years, Oak Hill 
Elementary pro

offered at Oak Hill Elementary School include Yearbook Club, Garden Club, Safe School Am
bassadors, Spirit Squad, Tech 
Club, Student Council, and Green Beret.  Our Green Beret program is designed to teach students how to solve conflict 
peacefully.  Students in the 5th grade go through a one day training to learn skills such as listening, using
 
"I" messages, 
and understanding body language.   Selected students act as "Green Beret" conflict managers who assist students in 
solving conflicts.
 
 
Oak Hill Elementary School's Mission Statement reads:  It is our Mission at Oak Hill Elementary to empower
 
ALL students 
to achieve their full potential.

Professional Development (Most Recent Three Years)
 
 
Decisions concerning the selection of staff development topics are performed by the Curriculum and Instruction office, 
the site administration, and site staff.  These decisions are based on state assessment 
results, data analysis and teacher 
input.
 
 
Weekly collaboration time is used to allow teachers to review and discuss student work samples.  Teachers are then able 
to discuss teaching strategies that they may implement to improve student learning in their cl
assrooms.  A portion of the 
weekly collaboration time is used for the Cadre teachers to share out what they have learned at the district and for 
teachers to practice those strategies.
