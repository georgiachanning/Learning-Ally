By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or
 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
pr
incipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Although 

growing school population and diverse program needs.  During the 2016 school year, local bonds were used to renovate 
existing facilities including our 
nurse's bathroom as well as two student bathrooms. New flooring was also placed in three 
of our classrooms.
 
 
The Alum Rock School District maintenance staff, in conjunction with day and night custodians, ensure the school buildings 
and grounds are safe, cl
ean, and in good repair. Rigorous daily custodial schedules ensure that classrooms, lavatories, 
serving kitchens, eating areas, offices, and playgrounds are clean for both student and staff use. Regular oversight by 
district maintenance crews ensures that 

grounds and play areas are safe for use.
 
 
All of the classrooms have new technology including
 
LCD projectors, Promethean Boards, new wiring, and installation to 
support the technology.  All second through fifth grade classrooms now have Activotes, Active Expressions, or iPods that 
allow students to interact with the Promethean Boards and give the 
teachers immediate feedback on how the students 
are learning the content and standards.
 
 
A water filtration system was installed in our cafeteria.  It is in use so the students can have access to clean, fresh water
 
to go along with our increase in water an
d decrease in sugary drinks program.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Ryan School has a very detailed, comprehensive school safety plan that outlines protocols, 
systems, and procedures in the 
event of any/all emergencies.  The plan also contains the yearly safety goals as determined by the students, staff, and 
parents.  The plan is discussed with the School Site Council in December of each school year.  The plan w
as last updated 
during the 2019/2020 school year, and is continuously reviewed with staff.  Safety alerts are shared with all staff as needed
 
throughout the school year.  In addition, all required drills are calendared and completed, and the results are sh
ared with 
the staff.  Staff also share feedback after our drills in the form of discussions and surveys.
 
 
Our safety plan has a comprehensive, enforceable, and continuous behavior policy, set of rules and regulations, dress 
code policy, set of protocols fo
r safety/emergency drills, tardy policy, attendance policy, referral policy, non
-
discriminatory 
policy on student rights and responsibilities, campus security policy, harassment policy, Internet safety policy, and an 
intervention policy.
 
 
The grounds are m
onitored by the principal, teachers, custodians, and parents, and the office staff has radios to 
communicate in case of any emergency.  The back gates are locked during the day to keep the campus closed.  All visitors 
must enter the office and receive a pa
ss if they are to remain on campus and check out when they leave.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
At Ryan STEAM Academy, there are many programs available to support, assist, and monitor student achievement. 
 
As a 
school, we offer many extracurricular activities such as art classes, after school interventions, mouse squad, and robotics 
club.  Our community liaison as well as teachers provide the after school activities.  In January
-
February, after
-
school state
 
testing prep classes were offered to at
-
risk students scoring below proficiency levels in reading language arts. We were 
able to hold two sessions for 6 weeks which are offered to all students in 3rd
-
5th grade.  Throughout the year, students 
in transition
al kindergarten through fifth grade engage in a STEAM program that provides all students with hands
-
on 
learning and exposure to academic language connected to the engineering design progress.
 
 
In addition to the programs offered to students, we ensure that
 
our staff is trained and knowledgeable on the common 
core state standards.  The Ryan staff receives training in guided reading and standards
-
based workshop centers by 
attending trainings and purchasing materials to support classroom instruction and profes
sional growth.  Teachers also 
have access to our STEAM curriculum and have release time to backwards plan the content.
 
 
As a staff, we continuously monitor student achievement.  We hold full day Student Success Team meetings to provide 
supports for student
s who are achieving below grade level.  Our instructional coach and classroom teachers also make 
sure that students are making yearly progress on the ELPAC assessment and continue to monitor students for two years 
once they are reclassified.
 
 
A full time i
nstructional coach (.5 is funded by our district) assists in the full implementation of the current curriculum and 
in differentiated instruction using modeled lessons to ensure all teachers are teaching the program with fidelity. The 
instructional coach al
so releases teachers using substitutes so they can visit other classrooms or schools to improve their 
practice.

Staff has been trained in common core through on
-
site, district, and county professional development. Our focus for the 
past two years has been on guided reading and small group instruction in ELA and math.   During staff meetings and grade 
level collabora
tions, our staff utilizes data to drive instruction including iready scores and data from the level screeners.  
As a staff, we have agreed to monitor student reading behaviors through anecdotal notes. Optional professional 
development is offered at least t
wice a month on Thursday afternoons. That staff also receives optional PD in the areas of 
technology, classroom management, and blended learning.
 
 
As a school we also have opportunities to work with our instructional coach during weekly coaching cycles.  O
ur 
instructional coach also provides planning support to individual teachers and grade levels.  Our principal completes regular 
walkthroughs in all classrooms and attends a monthly Instructional Leadership professional learning community.
 
 
Staff are also i
nvited to attend conferences and workshops throughout the year.  In the past years, we have sent staff to 
the STEAM symposium as well as the writer's workshop conference.
