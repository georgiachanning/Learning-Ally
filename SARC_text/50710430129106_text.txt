By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a 
School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Loc
al Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with 
data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more 
information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members
 
should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
2019/10
 
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 12, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or scie
nce lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the 
classroom and to take home.
 
 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the S
tate 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption.

he table displays information collected in August, 2019 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

inspection occurs by a team composed of site and district personnel to identify future areas to address and 
prioritize 
facility needs.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The 
SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative As
sessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate
 
in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who
 
have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
