School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of 
this survey are included within this report. The results of this survey are available at the district office and on the inter
net 
at 
mcs4kids.com.
 
 
In order to maintain a safe school, all visitors are required to report to the front office and register their visit. Before 
school 
supervision is provided by yard duty supervisors from 8:10 until 8:40 each morning. Morning and afternoon rec
esses are 
supervised by up to two yard duty supervisors. During lunch recess, there are three to five yard duty supervisors on the 
school playground.  A cafeteria supervisor oversees lunch in the cafeteria. The principal is often assisting in supervision 
d
uring all of these times.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which

are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

Professional development in MCS is data driven using research
-
based best practices to 
ensure our students receive 
guaranteed and viable curriculum in every grade, in every school.    We use formative and summative data to drive our 
instructional decisions and focus for professional development.  To this end, we utilize multiple structures  
to provide 
high
-
quality professional development to our staff including:  summer training, preservice
-
days, district wide professional 
development days, after school workshops, Saturday workshops, substitute
-
release days, instructional coaching, a BTSA 
and
 
PAR program,  and most recently a 0.5% compensation package for those who choose to complete an extra 6 hours 
of professional development.
 
 
MCS has prioritized our focus on mathematics, literacy across grades and content areas, collaboration, welcoming 
sc
hools/customer service, and building our capacity as professionals.  This has been in addition to the needed training in 
new adoptions, curriculum and standard updates and the like.  The professional development is sustained through site 
administration, di
strict and site level instructional coaches, and intervention specialists.  In the 2019
-
202 academic year, 
a new division was also created in order to increase the quality and quantity of professional development provided to 
classified, certificated, and m
anagers alike.
