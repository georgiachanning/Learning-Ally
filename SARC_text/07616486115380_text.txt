Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
This school has 27 classrooms, a multi
-
purpose room, a library and an administration building.  In addition, there are 4 
portables on the site.  The school was constructed in 1998. The school opened in 1998.
 
 
The District takes great efforts to ensure that
 
all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the LEA 
uses the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the Office of Public School Construction. The results of this survey are
 
available at the school office, at the LEA office,
 
or on the internet at https://www.antiochschools.net/SARC.  Additionally, 
select school site staff have access to iServiceDesk to submit work requests.  The Maintenance and Operations Department 
receives the iServiceDesk requests, reviews, and creates wor
k orders in TMA which in turn are assigned to field personnel 
to address the actual issues.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System,

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and gra
de eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive 
disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stu

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety 
Plan was reviewed by the School Leadership Team and School Site Council in August and September 
2019.  The Safety Committee, as part of School Site Council, adopted the plan on September 30, 2019.  The Safety Plan 
includes disaster and emergency procedures
 
as well as daily school safety procedures for the entire school community.  
Procedures are implemented daily for a safe and orderly environment at all times.  Fire drills occur on a monthly basis and 
disaster drills are planned throughout the school year.
 
Grant Elementary is a PBIS school, with a focus on teaching each 
student to Be Responsible, Be Respectful and Be Safe. Student behaviors that are unsafe, irresponsible, or disrespectful 
are tracked in the school Aeries system. The school counselor and cla
ssroom teachers have taught all students the "Tools" 
for handling conflict and making positive choices through the "Toolbox" program.  All teachers have been trained to use 
Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures in daily lessons, to promote student collabor
ation and engagement in the learning 
task.  Staff analyzes behavior data and provides interventions to groups or individual students as warranted. All 
suspensions and serious discipline are reported to the California Safe Schools Assessment. AUSD has a zer
o
-
tolerance 
policy for weapons on campuses. The staff requires all guests to sign in at the school office upon arrival to campus.

In the spring of 2019 teachers and administrators were involved in a collaborative process to redesign the content and 
delivery system of our three 
professional development days for the 2019
-
20 school year (August 5, 2019, November 1, 
2019, January 6, 2020). As a result, the delivery system changed from prescriptive to a conference style, teacher choice 
format. The content for each learning session is
 
organized into three domains: Academic Content, Social and Emotional 
Learning, and Technology. All certificated employees in the Antioch Unified School District participate in each of the three 
days of training. The first day included over 50 sessions for
 
teachers to select from based on their identify area of interest 
or need. The second day was a blended approach with both a variety of sessions offered by the district and site selected 
and delivered sessions. The final day in January was hosted at the si
te level and a variety of resources were provided to
