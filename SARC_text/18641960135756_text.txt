School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical

As a charter school, 
Thompson Peak Charter School is founded on parent involvement.  Parents are integral in the 
development of each student's learning plan.  The Resource Center has a Parent
-
Teacher

by parent members and meets monthly.  The PTSA
's purpose is to involve and empower parents in the learning community 
and support the efforts of student and staff.  There is also an Advisory Council with elected members; this group reviews 
grant budgets, safety plans, and other State and Federal docume
nts.  Additionally, there are opportunities for volunteering

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The comprehensive school safety plan was last reviewed and updated in September 2019; this update was expressly to 
reflect the new school information.  Prior to that date, a more comprehensive update was adopted by the governing board 
in April 2019.  The s
chool's Advisory Council is scheduled for its annual review on 1/16/2020.  This committee is comprised 
of faculty, parents, and a student member.  The Safety Plan will then be sent to the governing board in February 2020.
 
 
The plan is compliant with the components outlined in Education Code 32281.  These sections include Child Abuse 
Reporting, Disaster Procedures, Guidelines for Suspension and Expulsion, Sexual harassment Policies, Dress Code, 
Procedures for Ingress & Egress
, Safe & Orderly Conduct, School Discipline Rules & Consequences, Hate Crime procedures, 
and the Review, Evaluation, and Amendment procedures.

Annually, the plan for staff development is determined by both the needs assessment engaged in during the Local Control 
Accountability Plan (LCAP) process and a survey administered to staff.  Schoolwide initiatives include improving 
mathematics and writing
, mastery
-
based learning, and increasing opportunities for hands
-
on or project based learning.  
Staff indicate which initiatives and areas they need more support.  In general, the school shares information in an assembly 
format with the staff as a whole gr
oup.  The support is then personalized based on individual needs and progress.  Staff 
members may choose from using a coach from Better Lesson, engaging in one
-
on
-
one video discussions; mentor support; 
principal
-
teacher conversations; and twice monthly col
legial conversations to discuss results and student performance 
data.
