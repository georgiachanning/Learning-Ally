By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Buttonwillow is preparing students to be academically succ
essful and productive citizens by providing opportunities that 
will allow them to embrace challenges and develop a passion for lifelong learning.
 
 
Thank you for taking the time to become familiar with the Buttonwillow Elementary School Accountability Repor
t Card 

students, and staff. The information presented is intended to clarify school goals, describe school improvement efforts, 
and gauge st
udent achievement progress. Buttonwillow School is dedicated to promoting a climate where students and 
staff members believe all students can and will succeed. As we continue in an era of local control funding and school 
accountability, we have so much to 
look forward to at our school. The local control funding along with staff and community 
input is providing a direction for our school and our students. Through the alignment of Common Core instruction and the 
integration of our teaching and curriculum, we 
will continue to see opportunities opened up to our students. Some of 
these additional opportunities include our After School programs and clubs, STEM Girls Mentoring Program, and college 
field trips. Over the past several years, referrals and suspensions 
have dropped by over 85 percent. Our school
-
wide 
intervention program is paying dividends as data indicates performance is significantly increasing. With so much to offer, 
we encourage parents and families to be involved in the opportunities presented to o
ur students on a daily basis. We 
strive for the success of everyone at Buttonwillow Union School District.

Buttonwillow Union School District adheres to the state adoption cycle for textbook purchasing for all core subjects. 
Teacher, parent, and trustee representatives are actively involved in the selection of texts and curricular materials. 
Textbook committees are formed and meet to examine publisher samples and to narrow down the number of texts to be 
seriously considered by
 
the board for adoption. Prior to the final selection, the core texts being considered are made 
available for public view and comment. The board of trustees adopts all core texts after considering the recommendations 
of the textbook committees. Each pupil 
has access to his or her own copy of the standards
-
aligned textbooks (approved 
by the State Board of Education) and instructional materials in the core curriculum areas of reading/language arts, math, 
science, and history/social science to use in class and

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Buttonwillow School has 28 classrooms, including t
hree relocatable classrooms, and serves approximately 350 students 
in grades Pre
-
K
-
8th. The design capacity of the school is for 550 students. The original classroom buildings for Buttonwillow 
School were built in 1928 with additional classrooms and other 
school buildings built between 1937 and 1949. Major 
facility projects took place from 2003
-
11 and provided for modernized classrooms, restrooms, a gym, roofing, grounds, 
play areas, water and sewer lines, and sprinkler systems. The modernized campus is ful
ly ADA compliant and asbestos 

-
campus library, a 
community meeting room, and a modernized computer lab were completed in 2010. Junior high classrooms were 
mo
dernized in 1989, and the gymnasium, built in 1957, was modernized during the summer of 2007. A cafeteria building 
was completed in 1939 and modernized in 1955 and again in 1996. Five classrooms are dedicated for special
-
education 
classes, including a Reso
urce Specialist Program (RSP), four Special Day Classes (two mild/moderate and two 
moderate/severe), and a designated instruction and services (DIS) speech class. Athletic facilities include the modernized 
gym for indoor sports, and well
-
kept fields and a 
track for outdoor sports. The school has a kindergarten playground and 
an elementary playground, both of which were modernized during the fall of 2006. A multipurpose room with a stage is 
used regularly for student performances, parent meetings, and other 
school activities and community functions. Two 
classrooms were fully upgraded with technology, flooring, and wall coverings in preparation for class size reduction that 
promoted more classroom space. Additionally, the interior of the gym and the cafeteria 
were all completed in the summer 
of 2014. During the 15 
-
 
16 school year, air conditioners were upgraded on the Junior High classrooms as well as outside 
lighting added across the campus. The maintenance staff works diligently to maintain a safe and clean 
school campus. 
Work schedules provide daily cleaning of classrooms, restrooms, the cafeteria, and other areas on campus. Trash 
receptacles are placed strategically throughout the campus, and students are regularly reminded to pick up after 
themselves in th
e classrooms, the cafeteria, and throughout campus.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
