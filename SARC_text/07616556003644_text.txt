School Description
 
 
Message From 
Principal
 
At Brentwood Elementary School, students, parents, staff and community work together to ensure 
that each student receives a rigorous, comprehensive, balanced and integrated educational 
program in a safe and caring environment. This year we have c
ontinued our focus on improving 
student achievement in Language Arts and Math. Our goal is for all students to meet or exceed the 
California Content Standards. The Brentwood staff is dedicated to the academic success of each of 
our students. Each student h
as access to a standards based curriculum in language arts, 
mathematics, science and social science. We also know that each child is unique and we celebrate 
the diversity of our school and community.
 
 
We welcome parent involvement as an important element o
f student achievement. A safe and 
orderly school environment and high expectations and standards for behavior establish Brentwood 
Elementary School as a caring community where students are safe to learn and grow. The 
Brentwood staff knows that good teachin
g is the most important factor influencing student 
achievement. The skilled staff is committed to ongoing professional growth focused on our goal of 
improved student achievement in reading and writing. We analyze assessment data and meet 
regularly as teams
 
to examine the effectiveness of our teaching practices. Here at Brentwood 
Elementary we are very proud to be a part of a learning community with an on going tradition of 
academic excellence.

utilize a Parent/Student/Teacher contract that outlines the 
expectations and commitment for students, families and the school. Goals are reviewed regularly 
as students learn to become responsible for their own learning. This is just one example of the lev
el 
of commitment shown by all members of our school community to help our students become the 
best they can be.

District Mission Statement
 
The Brentwood Union School District will provide an exemplary education to all children in a safe, student centered 
environment designed 
to nurture the whole child and partner with families to prepare globally productive citizens.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is 
required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (
LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported i
n an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa
/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members shoul
d contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Brentwood Union Elementary held a public hearing on Sept. 11, 2019, and determined that each school 
within the district had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of Californ
ia. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual st
andards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making th
e textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teache
rs and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommend
ed materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. The table displays information collected in Sept. 
11, 2019 about the quality, 
currency, and availability of the standards

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of the Brentwood Union School District.  The district and schools are in co
mpliance with all laws, rules, 
and regulations 
pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The School Site Safety plan was last reviewed and updated 3
/1/2019 
by the School Safety Committee. All revisions were communicated to the both the classified and certificated staff.  The sch

plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a regu
lar basis throughout the school 
year.  Lockdown and Lockout drills are held twice a year. Students are 
supervised before and after school and during lunch by certificated and classified 
staff and the principal. Parent volunteers help with supervision during lunch and break periods. There is a designated area f
or student drop off and pick 
up. All visitors ar
e required to check in at the office upon arrival and before departing from the school campus.  Visitor badges are issued at 
the time of 
check
-
in and are to be worn throughout the visit.  All visitors are scanned by our Raptor Visitor system.
 
 
Discipline &
 
Climate for Learning
 

: All student will have a safe 
school culture, climate and learning environment in order to support student p
hysical, mental and emotional health.  All sites have implemented best 
practices for character education, bullying prevention, diversity appreciation programs, and social media education.  In addi
tion, students in the 
Brentwood Union Elementary School Dist
rict are guided by specific rules and classroom expectations that promote respect, cooperation, courtesy and 
acceptance of others. Parents and students are informed of school rules and discipline policies through the (Parent/Student a
nd book/newsletters/Fr
iday 
folders) which are sent home throughout the school year.
 
 
The Suspensions and Expulsions table illustrates total cases for the last three years, as well as a percentage of enrollment.
 
Expulsions occur only when 
required by law or when all other means 
of correction have failed.
