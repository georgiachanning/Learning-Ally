School Description
 
 
Rosebank is a Kindergarten through grade 6 school that was built in 1952. It is located in the 
northwestern section of Chula Vista and is one of 49 
schools in the Chula Vista Elementary School 
District, including charters. The Rosebank community appreciates its rich diversity, both culturally 
and economically. Its attendance boundaries contain a wide range of housing that includes several 
large apartm
ent complexes. 
 
 
The administration and staff work together with the community to coordinate the school's 
resources, materials, and support personnel. Our goal is to provide the best education possible for 
all students. Rosebank has a 
significant number of zone and inter
-
district transfers. Parent and 
community volunteers are an integral part of Rosebank's success. The countless hours that our 
parents, teachers, and staff donate help create an exemplary school. The quest for excellence 
is 
demonstrated by our outstanding teaching and support staff, supportive parents, community, and 
wonderful students.
 
 
WE BELIEVE ALL STUDENTS CAN LEARN
 
 
During the 2019
-
2020 school year, we took time to create a common vision:
 
 
At Rosebank Elementary, car
ing teachers work together to provide purposeful instruction to meet 
the needs and talents of each student academically, behaviorally, socially and emotionally by 
fostering:
 
 

 
Confidence
 

 
Creativity 
 

 
Consistent expectations
 

 
21st century skills
 
 
We nurture me
aningful relationships with the Rosebank Family Community through open 
communication with students, parents and the community at large.
 
 
*Our Mission*
 
 
The staff, students and parents of Rosebank believe that all students can learn and achieve, 
regardless 
of their past academic performance, family background, socio
-
economic status, race, 
and gender. We believe that our school's purpose is to:
 

 
Educate all students to high levels of academic performance
 

 
Emphasize the 4 C's: Collaboration, Communication, Creat
ivity, & Critical Thinking
 

 
Foster positive growth in social/emotional behaviors and attitude
 
 
We accept the responsibility to work together so that all students can attain their maximum 
educational potential.

*To Fulfill Our Mission*
 
 
We will provide a comprehensive kindergarten through sixth grade program that models the importance of responsibility, respec
t, and 
emphasizes equal educational opportunities. To ensure successful learning, our program will include high expectations of kno
wledge, 
skills and attitudes. Our teachers regularly monitor student data to inform their instruction. 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By Feb
ruary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fun
ding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state
 
and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the s
chool, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Research shows a high correlation between parent involvement and effective schools.  We encourage parents to visit and become
 
active in our school.
 
 
Parents are 
highly encouraged to be active members of our Parent Teacher Association (PTA).  This proactive group provides numerous activ
ities, 
experiences, materials, and equipment that benefit the welfare of our children. DUring the 2019
-
2020 school year, we had a r
ecord number of parents 
attending PTA meetings, and our PTA conducted our most highly attended community festivals in the history of the school.
 
 
Another parent group is our English Learner Advisory Committee, or ELAC.  Because of the steady number of inco
ming English learners at Rosebank, we 
want to ensure that the academic and social needs of this target group are being met.  Every effort is being made to increase
 
the parent participation in 
this group, which has the potential to add great value to our sc
hool and community.
 
 
Four Rosebank parents are members of our School Site Council.  They play an integral role in assuring our educational program
 
is driven by student needs.  
At each monthly meeting we review and revise our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achieve
ment and advise on our budget expenditures.

During the 2016 
-
 
17 school year, professional development has been centered around closing the achievement gap that was evident in the data fr
om 
last year's end of year assessments.  Rosebank's ILT has lead the professional development
 
recently in deciding for the school which ELD standard to 
focus on and develop strategies to improve student achievement.  Also, based on the previous year's data, Rosebank's staff ha
s focused on improving 
the math unit planning, scope and sequence, and e
nd of quarter assessments using a backwards mapping approach.  During the 2017 
-
 
2018 school year 
professional development has been centered around math problem solving, problem situations, and math talks.  The Rosebank sta
ff has begun to 
familiarize thems
elves with the Next Generation Science Standards in preparation for the start of state testing in science in the 5th grade.  
Lastly, we 
have continued our focus on using GLAD strategies this year tied to our new Benchmark curriculum.   During the 2018 
-
 
20
19 school year professional 
development has centered around social emotional learning, PBIS, and high impact language strategies for both ELA and math. O
ur cohort PDs have been 
focused on math instruction and strategies to promote collaborative conversatio
ns, such as number talks, 3 reads, why/justify, and creating success 
criteria for each math unit.  During the 2019
-
2020 school year, professional development has been centered around teacher well
-
being, belief in students' 
abilities to succeed and language
 
development.  The school is examining its literacy practicesand student access to rigorous curriculum.
