Principal's Message
 
W
elcome to Oakmont Outdoor School. We invite you to view our School Accountability Report 
Card. In accordance with Proposition 98 and to fulfill state and federal disclosure requirements, 
every 
school in California is required to issue an annual School Accountability Report Card.  Parents 
and community members will find valuable information about our academic achievement, 
professional staff, curricular programs, instructional materials, safety pr
ocedures, classroom 
environment, and condition of facilities.
 
 
We are unique in that we run a thematic outdoor program in the Claremont Unified School District. 
Oakmont Outdoor School is located on the corner of Arrow Hwy. and College Ave. Our picturesque 
campus features beautiful trees, gardens and murals, as well as a large playground with multiple 
play structures and plenty of field play space. Our small size, approximately 300 students, is one of 
our main features, as we offer a personal education that 
focuses on the individual needs of each 
student.
 
 
We are an AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) Elementary School specializing in 
delivering the Common Core State Standards using the world's biomes as a thematic setting where 
students participa
te in a variety of outdoor field study experiences. Each grade level (TK
-
6) studies 
one of the world's biomes and has a culminating trip to that biome which includes overnight travel 
for our fourth to sixth grade students. There are many exciting events th
at occur over the school 
year that, added to exceptional classroom instruction, provide a state
-
of
-
the
-
art educational and 
family setting. Oakmont Outdoor School emphasizes high expectations for students, staff and 
families. Home and school relations are a
 
high priority in order to work together as a unified team 
for the good of all students. We encourage our parents to get involved and there are many 
opportunities such as: School Site Council, Parent Faculty Association (PFA), English Language 
Learner Advi
sory Committee (ELAC), classroom volunteers, chaperoning, etc. Our parent groups 
are active and offer a variety of experiences. Together we have developed a mission statement that 
guides our decision making for the future.
 
 
Mission Statement

r School builds strong, successful citizens through academic and outdoor

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instruction
al Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Oakmont Outdoor School are currently being aligned to the California State Stand
ards. Instructional materials 
are selected from the state's most recent list of standards
-
based 
materials and adopted by the State Board of Education. The district follows the State 
Board of Education's adoption cycle for core content materials (English language arts, math, science, and social science).
 
 
On Thursday, October 17, 2019, the Claremont U
nified School District's Board of Education held a public hearing to certify the extent to which textbooks 
and instructional materials have been provided to students. The Board of Education adopted Resolution #06
-
2020 which certifies as required by Educati
on 
Code ยง60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional materials were provided to all students, including English learners, in the 
district to the extent that each 
pupil has a textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to take home, and
 
(2) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials were 
provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with 
the cycles and content of 
the curriculum frameworks in math, science, hi
story
-
social science, and English language arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materia
ls used for their visual/performing 
arts curricula. During the 2018
-
19 
school year, Claremont Unified School District provided each student, including English learners, enrolled in a 
visual/performing arts class with a textbook or instructional materials to use in class and to take home. These materials com
plied with the stat
e's content 
standards and curriculum frameworks.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and 
functional through proper facilities maintenance and campus supervision. 
Oakmont Outdoor School's original facilities were built in 1954; ongoing maintenance and campus improvements ensure facilitie
s remain up to date and 
provide adequate space for student
s and staff. District maintenance and site custodial staff ensure that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good 
condition are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used by school and district staff to communicate non
-
routine mainten
ance requests. 
Emergency repairs are given the highest priority..
 
 
Every morning before school begins, the custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards or other conditions that need attent
ion prior to students and staff 
entering school grounds. Two day
 
custodians (one full
-
time and one part
-
time) and one part
-
time evening custodian are assigned to Oakmont Outdoor 
School. The day custodians are responsible for: 
 

 
Classroom cleaning
 

 
General grounds maintenance
 

 
Lunch area setup/cleanup
 

 
Restroom cleaning

Restrooms are checked throughout the day for cleanliness and subsequently cleaned as needed. The evening custodian is respons
ible for: 
 

 
Classroom cleaning
 

 
Common use area cleaning

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the S
tate priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
