Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Gravenstein Union School District is a Transitional Kindergarten through
 
8th
-
grade school district with an enrollment of 
approximately 750 students, most of whom come from English speaking homes with a variety of socio
-
economic 
backgrounds. The district is located in the western rural section of Sebastopol in Western Sonoma Co
unty. The District 
serves a primarily rural population in an area of limited growth. Approximately ninety
-
four percent of the property located 

 
classification also affects the number of students living within the district.
 
 
There are four schools in the district. Gravenstein Elementary School is a TK
-
5 charter school with the exception of some 
first
-
grade classes (called Gravenstein First School)
. Hillcrest Middle School is a 6th 
-
 
8th
-
grade middle school which is a 
charter school, and the district also has a Community Day School. The District is a TK
-
8 Magnet Program due to the ENRICH! 
program.
 
 
The sites reflect the rural nature of the community
. The relatively low teacher: student ratio at each site, excellent staff, 
and very involved parents have worked together to establish a student body that has achieved some of the highest 
standardized test scores in Sonoma County for the last 15 years.
 
 
Al
l classes TK
-
5 are self
-
contained. Primary classes (TK
-
3) have an approximate ratio of 20
-
1 and middle grades average an 
approximate ratio of 25
-
1. Instructional support assistants, paid by categorical monies, are utilized in Grades TK
-
8 
according to need 
in the classroom. Instructional assistants work in conjunction with the Special Education Teachers to 
instruct in Learning Labs at both campuses. The Learning Labs are operated through combining categorical funding to 
serve students who need intervention o
r tutoring. Students are provided service according to their need 

 
regardless of 
whether they qualify for special education or not. This setting provides additional services in the areas of 
Reading/Language Arts and Math to identified and/or below
-
grade
-
l
evel students. Other services available to Gravenstein 
Union School District students (on both campuses) include the Speech and Language Program, an academic counselor, 
and a school psychologist. The same services are available at the middle school campus.
 
 
Students in grades TK through 3 receive music instruction one day per week and students in grades 4 and 5 receive music 
instruction twice a week. Visual art is also part of the Gravenstein School program and all students receive weekly art 
instruction.  
Hillcrest Middle School has a variety of scheduled music, art and drama programs. All grade levels participate 
in regular field trips and enrichment classes.
 
 
The school district utilizes a social
-
emotional learning program (SEL) entitled Second Step.  Emp
athy, Emotion 
Management, Impulse Control, Problem Solving, and Anger Management are some of the topics covered.
 
 
Thank you for your interest in our schools.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
This school has 16 classrooms, a performing 
arts/gymnasium, and an administration building. Within two campuses, the 
district employs three full
-
time custodial and maintenance professionals. The district works proactively to provide safe, 
clean, and adequate facilities. Deferred Maintenance projects
 
are continually planned and executed (such as replacement 
of student restroom stalls, tiolets, and tile as needed on both campuses. Classroom carpet replacement, painting, blacktop 
and striping of parking lots are just a few of the other ongoing projects.
 
 
We have had a modernization or new building project (to remove and replace old modular units) at one of the campuses 
every summer for the last several years. In 2012 the district passed a General Obligation Bond for a new building project 
at the Hillcres
t Middle School campus and modernization project at Gravenstein Elementary. The new building project at 
Hillcrest was completed during the summer of 2015. Phase 1, which was completed in August of 2015, included new 
roofing, sidewalks, and ADA compliance c
onstruction. Phase 2 of the modernization began in June of 2016. This part of 
the modernization includes a complete renovation of the student restrooms, heating and lighting in most classrooms, and 
changes to the district and school offices. Phase 2 was co
mpleted at the start of the 2017
-
18 year. Phase 3 on the 
Gravenstein Elementary campus is scheduled to begin in the summer of 2018, and includes remodeling the multi
-
purpose 
room, staff bathrooms, and learning lab classroom with new flooring, lighting, and
 
heating system. Phase 4 began on 
Hillcrest campus the summer of 2018, and includes the following: new energy efficient lighting; parking lot cover with 
solar array; ADA access to the lower field, and a new switch gear and transformer. Phase 4 is completed
 
for Hillcrest.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative 
Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participa
te in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students w
ho have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
