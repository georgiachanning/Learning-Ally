By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
 
The District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the Di
strict 
uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. This survey was 
completed on 05/01/2019 and is available at the Facilities, Maintenance and Operations office.
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and 
the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Facilities Description
 
This school has 18 permanent classrooms, 20 portable classrooms, a library, a multipurpose room, and an administration 
bu
ilding. The main campus was built in 1960 and modernized in 1996. Five relocatable classrooms were added in 2015.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.

Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The school is cleaned every other night by a district cleaning crew. Work perfo
rmed includes: sweeping, vacuuming, and 
mopping floors, emptying trash, cleaning sinks, filling dispensers, and dusting rooms, as scheduled. Grounds are 
maintained by District groundskeeping staff. There is one full
-
time day custodian. The day custodian is
 
responsible for 
daily restroom cleaning, cleaning eating and food preparation areas, daily grounds clean up, minor facility repairs, and 
special emergency clean ups. Carpets are shampooed and tile flooring is cleaned and refinished every winter, spring, a
nd 
summer break. A thorough deep cleaning of all areas is done every summer. District administration works daily with 
custodial and grounds supervisors to ensure a clean, safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The District allocates funds for completion
 
of deferred maintenance projects which consists of major repair or 
replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, 
electrical systems, interior or exterior paint, and floor systems
.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information 
relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general ed
ucation population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs
 
items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses tha
t satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Each year, teachers and support staff participate in Professional 
Learning, as indicated in the Comprehensive School Plan 
for Student Achievement (SPSA), the Local Education Agency Plan and Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP). Priorities 
for professional learning are established for teacher and staff training using 
student achievement data, teacher needs 
assessment surveys, and observations of instruction. In response to these priorities, sessions are developed to support 
classroom implementation. Teachers requiring additional certifications to meet student needs are
 
enrolled in appropriate 
programs.
 

 
Certificated and support staff participate in workshops offered within the District (in person and online), offered 
by the San Diego County Office of Education, local universities or outside vendors as appropriate.
