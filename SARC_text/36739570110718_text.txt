By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019

Principal's Message
 
I'd like to welcome you to Vista Verde AVID Elementary School's Annual School Accountability Report Card. In accordance 
with Proposition 98, every sc
hool in California is required to issue an annual School Accountability Report Card that fulfills 
state and federal disclosure requirements. Parents will find valuable information about our academic achievement, 
professional staff, curricular programs, ins
tructional materials, safety procedures, classroom environment, and condition 
of facilities.
 
 
Vista Verde AVID Elementary School provides a safe, nurturing learning environment where scholars are actively involved 
in learning academics, as well as positive
 
character values. Scholars receive a standards
-
based, challenging curriculum 
based on their individual needs by dedicated professional staff. Ongoing evaluation of scholar progress and achievement 
assists us in refining the instructional program so schola
rs can achieve academic proficiency. We have made a commitment 
to provide the best educational program possible for Vista Verde AVID Elementary School's scholars. We welcome any 
suggestions or questions you may have about the information contained in this 
report or about the school.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
Do Your Best and Forget the Rest!
 
 
School Profile
 
At Vista Verde AVID Elementary, we strive to work
 
within professional learning communities to help every scholar achieve 
their learning goals. Learning targets have been established and parents know exactly how their scholar is performing 
each week. Common Core State Standards and 21st Century Learning S
kills demand high levels of comprehension and the 
ability to transfer important skills to real life. Our scholars strive to be better readers, writers, mathematicians, and 
scientists in order to figure out what they want to be when they grow up.
 
The 
AVID binder system has increased parent involvement in their scholar's educational journey with 99% returned 
binders with parent/guardian signatures daily.  We have experienced parent participation at levels not seen in our school 
district this school year
.  Muffins with Moms (and aunts, sisters, grandmothers, foster parents) and Donuts with Dads (and 
uncles, brothers, grandfathers, foster parents), monthly Family Education Nights, and regular School Site Council meetings 
are just a few ways parents and gua
rdians feel connected to our school community.
 
 
Positive attendance is a goal for our school and the scholars we serve.  We offer Saturday STEAM Academies each month 
to help scholars improve their attendance.The class within each grade level with the highe
st attendance percentage earns 

attendance has their college flag flown on the flagpole in front of the school. In addition, students thrive
 
on our PBIS 
efforts of positively rewarding students with Viper Buck$.Our school earned PLATINUM recognition level within the 
California State PBIS system during the 2018/19 school year! The Viper Store program encourages students to follow the 
4 B's
-
 
Be 
Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Safe, and just Be Kind.  All staff members pay students Buck$ for exhibiting these 
expected behaviors as students purchase events that focus on building trusting relationships with adults on campus. As 
part of our PBIS effort
s we also hold bi
-
weekly assemblies in which students can add their Viper Buck$ to a random drawing 
for a chance to win small prizes. In addition to PBIS efforts, we have trained all classified and certificated staff in the u
se 
of Restorative Practices, a 
proactive, daily gathering that focuses on conflict resolution, classmate relationships, and the 
use of healthy social skills. New this year is our Expect Respect response system to eliminate bullying behavior, empower 
bystanders, and ensure learning envir
onments are physically and emotionally safe.  The smiles that are shared throughout 
the school are priceless!

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 10, 2019
 
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum are aligned to the California Content Standards and F
rameworks. Instructional 
materials are selected from the state's most recent list of standards
-
based materials and adopted by the State Board of 
Education. The district follows the State Board of Education's six
-
year adoption cycle for core content materia
ls 
(English/language arts, math, science, and social science).
 
 
On Tuesday, September 11, 2018  the Snowline Joint Unified School District's Board of Education held a public hearing to 
certify the extent to which textbooks and instructional materials have 
been provided to students. The Board of Education 
adopted Resolution #19
-
1352 which certifies as required by Education Code §60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional 
materials were provided to all students, including English learners, in the district to 
the extent that each pupil has a 
textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient textbooks and instructiona
l 
materials were provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the aca
demic content standards 
and consistent with the cycles and content of the curriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and 
English/language arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the s
ufficiency of instructional materials 
used for their visual/performing arts curricula. During the 2018
-
19 school year, Snowline Joint Unified School District 
provided each student, including English learners, enrolled in a visual/performing arts class with
 
a textbook or instructional 
materials to use in class and to take home. These materials complied with the state's content standards and curriculum 
frameworks.

Although the current history/social science 
materials are not from the most recent state 
adoption, our district has determined they 
are similarly 
aligned to the state standards. 
The teachers use supplemental units and 
materials to fill any gaps. Our math teams 
continue to meet collaboratively around 
essential standard instruction, learning, and 
assessment.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, a
nd functional through proper facilities 
maintenance and campus supervision. Ongoing maintenance and campus improvements ensure facilities remain up to 
date and provide adequate space for students and staff. District maintenance and site custodial staff ens
ure that the 
repairs necessary to keep the school in good condition are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used by 
school and district staff to communicate non
-
routine maintenance requests. 
 
 
Every morning before school begins, the 
custodian and campus monitors inspect facilities for safety hazards or other 
conditions that need attention prior to students and staff entering school grounds. The custodians monitor the facilities 
throughout the day to ensure students and staff are safe 
during and after school. Two
-
day custodians and four evening 
custodians are assigned to Baldy Mesa Elementary School. The day custodians are responsible for: 
 

 
Cafeteria setup/cleanup
 

 
Office area cleaning
 

 
Restroom cleaning
 

 
General cleaning of classrooms
 

 
Spe
cial event preparation
 
The day custodian checks restrooms throughout the day for cleanliness and subsequently cleans restrooms as needed. 
The evening custodians are responsible for thoroughly cleaning restrooms and classrooms. The principal communicates 
wi
th custodial staff daily concerning maintenance and school safety issues.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance 
 
Vista Verde Elementary School participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides dollar
-
for
-
dollar matching funds to assist school d
istricts with major repairs or replacement of existing school building components. 
Deferred maintenance projects generally include roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, 
interior/exterior painting, and floor systems. During the 2
018
-
19 school year, Vista Verde Elementary School received 
$61,232.09 in deferred maintenance funds for the repair and/or maintenance of asphalt, plumbing, HVAC, carpet, fire 
alarm system, and district wide wall system.
 
 
For the 2019
-
20 school year, the district has budgeted $750,000 for the deferred maintenance program. This represents 
0.865% of the Snowline Joint Unified School District general fund budget.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

scores.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Vista Verde AVID Elementary focused on the AVID system in which parents know exactly how their child is doing in school 
by looking at their personal AVID binder.  Parents are informed daily of their scholar's in class behavior through the use of
 
the AVID b
inder that each TK
-
5 grade scholar brings home and returns each day. All homework, reading logs, Reflex Math 
logins and other important school paperwork is stored neatly in the AVID binder for parents and guardians to access and 
review with their scholar d
aily at home.
 
 
Parents are encouraged to remain involved in their child's learning environment by volunteering in the classroom, 
participating in a decision
-
making group, or simply attending school events.
 
 
Parents stay informed of upcoming events and scho
ol activities through the AVID binder,  traditional flyers, School 
Messenger calls, newsletters, and weekly teacher newsletters.  Our teaching staff utilizes Class Dojo, a user
-
friendly app 
which communicates student behavior, work ethic, and academic succ
ess for parents who are on the go.  Parents often 
use the Class Dojo app to discuss their child's day at school, while focusing on the positive aspects each day brings.
 
All school forms are provided in English and Spanish.  Oral Spanish translation is avai
lable during school hours in the front 
office.   Contact school office staff at (760) 662
-
5650 for more information on how to become involved in your child's 
learning environment!
 
 
Parent conferences are planned for first trimester to communicate each scho
lars' academic progress.  Spanish translation 
is available at all conferences as applicable.
 
 
 
Opportunities to Be Involved at Home:
 
Check AVID binder daily
 
Communicate with classroom teacher using AVID binder
 
Discuss progress on Learning Targets and sign 
the form
 
Discuss daily learning opportunities with students at home using Class Dojo

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan was developed for Vista Verde Elementary School in collaboration with local 
agencies and the district office to fulfill Senate Bill 187 requirements. Components of this plan include child abuse 
reporting procedures
, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for 
safe arrival and departure from school, sexual harassment policy, and dress code policy. The school's most recent school 
safety plan was reviewed, updated, a
nd discussed with school staff in September 2019.   Lock blocks have been installed 
on all classroom doors to allow students to come and go throughout the day while the door remains locked. In case of a 
lock down, the teacher simply closes the lock block a
nd shuts the door while remaining inside the classroom.

Professional development over the past three years has included a sustained focus on the Common Core State Standards 
(CCSS) in both English language arts (ELA) and mathematics. Student 
achievement data clearly shows that both the former 
and the latter need significant attention in regards to instructional practices and intervention. Additionally, teachers are 
being provided textbook adoption training in the areas of math (TK
-
8) and histo
ry/social science (6
-
12) to ensure 
effectiveness and fidelity when it comes to using the new curricular materials. The Next Generation Science Standards 
(NGSS) Transition Team, composed of elementary and secondary teachers, continues to learn and build its
 
capacity in 
efforts to coach and support colleagues at their respective campuses. Tier I and upper tier Positive Behavior Interventions 
and Supports (PBIS) forums offer PBIS coaches and administrators training and collaboration opportunities intended to 
e
nhance PBIS systems across the district. The New Teacher Academy supports both teachers who are new to the 
profession as well as veteran teachers who are new to Snowline. This school year, all Snowline teachers will participate in 
the first of five Kagan C
ooperative Learning trainings, which are designed to show educators how to raise the level of 
student engagement and, in turn, increase student achievement. The importance of ensuring quality professional 
development for our instructional paraprofessionals
 
is also a priority. Training days on how to properly assess literacy and 
support students with special needs are facilitated.
 
 
The following are the number of professional development days (full school days) allocated to specific areas of need over 
the co

A vast majority of professional development occurs in
-
district during the school day. Substitute coverage for participating
 
teachers is coordinated through the Student Learning and Support Services department. The training 
sessions are
 
generally facilitated by district and site administrators and teachers.
 
 
Professional Learning Communities (PLC), supported by site administrators and district personnel, are the primary vehicles 
utilized to evaluate student academic data and 
classroom teaching practices. Snowline has moved towards greater 
consistency in regards to assessments used across the district. All students in grades 3
-
8 and 11 participate in the Interim 
Assessment Blocks (IAB), which align with the California Assessmen
t of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) and 
is an accurate performance predictor for the same. Principals and other site administrators conduct classroom visitations 
and provide specific feedback to teachers that validates strong teaching practices 
and/or brings attention to areas in need 
of growth. Teachers have a great deal of access when it comes to obtaining the specific professional development they 
need in order to maximize their effectiveness and increase the level of learning among their stud
ents.
