School Description
 
Healdsburg Elementary School is a TK
-
5 school on two campuses. Healdsburg Elementary School 
(HES) serves students in transitional kindergarten through second grade and Fitch Mountain 
Campus (FMC) serves students in grades third through f
ifth. Both sites are centrally located and 
accessible to residents and to the community at large.
 
 
The Blended Learning program is the primary instructional method for students in grades 1
-
5 at 
HES.  Blended Learning at HES utilizes a station rotation mode
l where students rotate through 
learning stations working in small groups, both individually and teacher directed to provide a 
personalized approach that is differentiated for each student.  Students utilize technology daily 
through adaptive software and a
s a tool for their research and projects. The program emphasizes 

projects and the personalization the model provides.  All students have two teachers; o
ne 
Humanities Specialist and one STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) 
Specialist. The Humanities teacher focuses on language arts and social studies and the STEM 
teacher primarily focuses on math and science with technology and engineeri
ng infused in the 
curriculum.
 
 
As a Title I School, we receive additional funding to provide targeted supports for students to ensure 
they are meeting rigorous academic standards. Each student uses Lexia, a computer
-
based program 
to build reading skills, t
o ensure they are reaching grade level standards as they progress through 
our school. Students who complete Lexia, utilize Reading Plus for adaptive reading comprehension 
and fluency skills. We also have intervention teachers who provide pull
-
out reading s
upport for 
those students who are more than a year behind in their reading skills.
 
 
Both school facilities include libraries, computer labs, large play areas, and multipurpose rooms. 
Students in both schools have modern Learning Labs for 21st 
Century exploration and access to 
iPads and Chromebooks in every classroom. With the support of the Healdsburg Education 
Foundation, all students are able to take a variety of in
-
school enrichment classes including chess, 
art, robotics, physical education,
 
interactive science, garden, music, and yoga.
 
 
Families are offered parent education opportunities throughout the year which include: Family 
Math Night and Family Reading Night as well as parent workshops in such topics as understanding 
the reclassificati
on process, preparing for parent
-
teacher conferences and helping students with 
their math at home. We use social
-
emotional curriculum from Second Step and Toolbox from 
Dovetail Learning to help children navigate a complicated world. HES also has a school p
sychologist 
and district behavioral specialist to help support students.
 
 
A preschool, run by North Bay Children's Center, is located at FMC and serves approximately 45 
students that feed into the Healdsburg Unified School District (HUSD). The HUSD, in par
tnership 
with the City of Healdsburg, offers the After School Education and Safety program to provide after 
school enrichment and academic support to K
-
8 students. An additional program (21st Century 
Community Learning Center) is also available to offer be
fore and after school care. The program is 
located at the Boys and Girls Club and on campus at HES and FMC. The local Boys and Girls Club of 
Healdsburg is located within walking distance of HES and shuttle distance of FMC. Additional after
-
school care is a
lso available to students through the Fitch Mountain Day Camp program at  FMC.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Plan
ned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Healdsburg Elementary School (HES) was built in 1935 and modernized in 1986. The school is a historic mission
-
style building with approximately 190 
students in grades K
-
2. A bond was passed in 2003, which allowed for 
the construction of a brand new kindergarten wing in 2006 and an upgrade to the 

or. The new kindergarten 
classrooms and adjacent en
larged kindergarten playground opened in August 2007. There is a plan to renovate about half of the classrooms in the main 
building during the summer of 2016. ALso, plumbing lines and drinking fountains throughout the main building will be replaced
.
 
 
In th
e summer of 2013, the interior common areas of Healdsburg Elementary School were upgraded with a new design. The new, more we
lcoming site 
creates an inviting space for our youngest students, their parents and our staff and community volunteers.
 
 
Fitch Moun
tain Campus (FMC) was built in 2005 in a mission
-
style, complimentary to the K
-
2 campus. The building incorporates energy efficient features, 
systems, and design. All classrooms are in excellent condition and are well maintained.  Two stand out features of
 
this campus are the large multipurpose 
room and welcoming library. The multipurpose room has a stage for performances, basketball hoops for activities, and a connec
ted kitchen for food 
service. The library is large, bright, and inviting. The playground co
nsists of a large blacktop area, play structure, and grass field.
 
 
Both campuses are clean, well maintained, and in good repair.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Sma
rter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligibl
e students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

school communication are published 
in English and Spanish.
 
 
Our active and involved Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) holds monthly meetings to coordinate fundraising
 
events, enrichment activities, assemblies, 
and other school events. Our PTO is a great support in the classroom as well. Many parents volunteer in the classroom and at 
school events to support 
student learning.
 
 
Our joint ELAC committee also meets regular
ly to discuss topics related to English Learners, bringing in outside speakers to teach parents how to support 
students and be involved in school.
 
 
Both campuses share a full time Parent Outreach & Education Coordinator whose primary goal in to increase sc
hool
-
home connectivity. In addition to 
hosting Family Reading and Math Nights, she hosts a series of workshops based on parent interest to engage parents in their s
tudent's schooling including 
how to prepare for parent

addresses the safety of students and staff in case of an emergency. It includes the ability to communicate with the district 
office 
and outside agencies for ongoing support services through a strong network of city, county, state and federal communication 
services. Our 
comprehensive site safety plans include monthly fire, earthquake and/or active threat drills. All site staff have been assign
ed tasks in our incident 
command charts and have received training on their roles and responsibilities.  Staff know w
here onsite and offsite reunification sites have been 
established.
 
 
Key elements of the plan include: implementing a process to better identify the individual needs of students, ensuring the sa
fety of students, staff training 
in first aid and disaster resp
onse. In addition, our plan includes implementation of Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) and the Toolbox 
program to address conflict resolution, anger management, impulse control, drug prevention, bullying and harassment preventio
n.

going professional development of staff is an important part of improving our 
school programs and student achievement.  Teachers have weekly 
collaboration time and at least 3 paid non

pupil professional development days throughout the school year and are encouraged to attend workshops 
and conferences both during the school year and 
during the summer months, paid for by HUSD.  Professional Development at Healdsburg Elementary 
School is currently focused on: math instructional practices, supporting English Language Learners, implementation of new sta
ndards and related 
curriculum, class
room management strategies that increase student engagement, technology integration including adaptive software and a Learnin
g 
Management System, administering and using Benchmark data to inform instruction.  Teachers participate in trainings to suppor
t so
cial

emotional 
learning, including Restorative Practices and Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports.  HUSD contracts with an external c
oaches to provide job

embedded coaching to support English Language Development and Blended Learning.
 
 
Our staff dev
elopment program focuses on the needs of our staff and the district goals as identified through the HUSD Local Control Accoun
tability Plan 
(LCAP) and the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA). For teachers and paraprofessionals, we emphasize instructi
onal strategies for diverse 
learners with a wide range of abilities. We bring presenters to the site for all staff and also allocate funding so that staf
f members can attend workshops 
or visit sites that fulfill a particular need specific for staff or the 
needs of the school.
