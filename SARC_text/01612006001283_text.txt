By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

This 2019
-
20 school year, we are continuing to implement our social
-
emotional learning program, Choose Love, focusing 
on characteristics of courage, gratitude, forgiveness and compassion. We are strengthening our 
school wide expectations 
of being a Stingray STAR: Be Scholarly, Be Trustworthy, Be Accepting, and Be Responsible. We are explicitly teaching 
students expectations of behavior in all areas of the campus (hallways, office, makerspace, library, kid connectio
n, 
classroom, playground, lunch room, etc). We have weekly Wednesday morning meetings to celebrate students, build 
school spirit, reinforce expectations, and reinforce Choose Love characteristics (Courage, Gratitude, Forgiveness and 
Compassion). 
 
 
Jackson 
Avenue began a new procedure for lunches this year. In reviewing our data from last year, we found a lot of 
students hurrying to eat so they could leave to play, lots of food was being wasted, and increased behaviors in the 
lunchroom. Our teacher leaders a
nd administration looked into the research of students playing and then eating. Articles 
published in the National Education Association and the New York Times talk about the benefits of playing before eating. 
A study by the Journal of Child Nutrition and 
Management (2006) indicates that schools who schedule recess before lunch 
found students eat more fruits and vegetables, waste less food, and are better behaved on the playground, in the 
lunchroom, and in the classroom. Nurses also reported a decrease in s
tudents complaining of headaches and 
stomachaches. We instituted "play and then eat" program so our students are hungry when they sit down to eat and then 
are in a calmer place to go back to class.
 
 
We began our work with Advancement Via Individual Determi
nation (AVID). This year, we are focusing on goal setting and 
writing strategies. We are piloting this is in a few classes (3rd and 5th grade). We are showcasing various colleges and 
careers to inspire students of what they want to aspire to do when they a
re adults. We will be expanding this program 
next school year. AVID complements similar work we are doing around personalized learning. Jackson Avenue Elementary 
School received a grant for over $25,000 from Silicon Schools to continue our work on supporti
ng student agency and 
personalized learning. We have focused on developing student agency, specifically in goal setting, tracking and planning 
for success as well as student choice in work tasks. We also changed our classroom environments to include flexib
le seating 
(standing desks, hokki stools, stadium chairs, etc.). 
 
 
We have created two additional learning environments for students. Our Makerspace is a place for students to build, 
create art, and learn to use a variety of digital tools such as bee bots 
for coding and green screens. With the support of 
our Parent Teacher Organization and a grant from Whole Foods, we have an outdoor classroom in our garden with space 
to grow plants in a greenhouse, learn about composting, and use the area for painting and 
exploring. We have a very 
active parent/teacher Green Team that supports our afterschool Garden Club, recycling in our lunch room, and various 
projects around our campus. 
 
 
We screen all our students in reading and then do more specific assessments for tho
se students who have gaps in reading. 
We then provide reading intervention to students 4 days a week. We also are fortunate to have some community 
volunteers who come to our school to support small group or individual students in mathematics. 
 
 
We also rec
eived the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) HealthierUS School Challenge Bronze Award 2015
-
2019 for excellence in nutrition and physical activity. 
 
 
Through a grant from Kaiser Permanente, we have been able to focus on nutritional and physical
 
health of students. We 
were able to install two water
-
filtration systems for students, provide organized physical activities on the playground to 
support students in being active, and nutritional information for students and families. We continue to be su
pported 
through Kaiser grants to support health and wellness programs on our site. We also received a grant from the San Jose 
Earthquakes and Wells Fargo to purchase soccer goal stands. 
 
 
We continue to participate in the Safe Routes to School program. We 
encourage students to walk, bike, or carpool to 
school. We have provided assemblies to students on street safety. We also won the Fire Up Your Feet activity challenge 
two years in a row.

Our Science Specialist implements Project Lead the Way (PLTW). PLTW
 
is a science program that focuses on engineering. 
It provides the opportunity for students to utilize critical
-
thinking, science, and math skills to apply and implement 

ols also offer PLTW programs. 
Jackson Avenue Elementary does whatever it takes to support students in succeeding. We have a team approach 
(Coordination of Services Team, Student Success Teams, and Grade Level Teams) to ensure students receive the additiona
l 
targeted support they may need to grow and excel. We value parent participation, support and input. We also have 
additional counseling opportunities for students going through difficult transitions, offered by Hume Center. We have 
incorporated mindfulnes
s strategies to help support student self
-
regulation, increasing their ability to focus and succeed. 
We also teach students strategies to promote a growth mindset, which will provide a path to being a lifelong learner. 
 
 
Jackson Avenue offers the following
 
programs and opportunities to students: 
 

 
Transitional kindergarten: Prepares younger students (chronologically or developmentally) for success in 
kindergarten for the following school year by using active learning with a focus on science, technology, 
engi
neering and math (STEM). Curriculum includes: Great Explorations in Math and Science (GEMS), Zoo
-
phonics, Handwriting Without Tears, and Math Their Way.
 

 
Kindergarten: We offer an extended
-
day kindergarten (from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.) for all our students.
 

 
Reading Block: Provides opportunities for small
-
group reading instruction across all grade levels. Our reading 
specialist provides direct small
-
group instruction to those students who require more support in developing 
their reading skills.

respect and respect for others. We believe education is a cooperative effort of the school, home, and 
community. Our primary goal is to prepare students to become responsible members of their immediate community and, 
ultimately, the global comm
unity. The years from grades TK
-
5 are a time of uninhibited wonder, enthusiasm for learning, 
and rapid intellectual growth. We take advantage of this unique window to help every child obtain the best possible start 
as a lifelong learner.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Jackson Avenue Elementary School
 
first opened in 1963. The facility has been expanded and remodeled over the past 50 
years. The school completed construction of the rest of the school in September 2008, funded by a local bond. Gates were 
installed enclosing the campus in the 2012
-
13 scho
ol year. There is a new kindergarten playground, two new K
-
5 
playgrounds, and extensive field areas for student play and physical education that were installed in 2018
-
19 thanks to 
the Measure J Bond. 
 
 
All classrooms have networked computers with printers
, a digital projector, sound system and a document camera. The 
library has eight Mac computers to access an electronic card catalog. We have a Chromebook cart in each 1
-
5 grade class. 
Kindergarten shares seven Chromebooks. Many teachers also have iPads for
 
small group or individual work. Many 
classrooms have added technology such as iPads and flat
-
screen TVs through grants. There is also a multipurpose room 
with a stage and a kitchen facility. 
 
 
A head custodian maintains the site from early morning to afte
rnoon, and 1.5 full time equivalent night custodians work 
from afternoon to late night. The custodial staff work to develop cleaning schedules to keep the site clean and safe. 
 
 
We have two gardens on campus. One garden is maintained by parent volunteers a
nd is used as an outside classroom. 
Another garden is maintained by a Girl Scout troop. They grow vegetables to provide to families in need. 
 
 
Measure J supported the installation of a new digital marquee for our school site. We also have recently 
installed solar 
panels in the parking lot and on our blacktop to provide shade during recess and PE. We installed three new playground 
structures through Measure J funding. We also have updated our field. All classrooms have ceiling mounted projectors 
and 
sound systems (installed in 2018
-
19). Security cameras were installed in 2018
-
19 as well.
 
 
Education is a top priority in the community of Livermore, and maintaining a safe and orderly environment maximizes 
student learning. The citizens of Livermore have 
passed three major funding measures targeting school facility needs: 
Measure B in 1975, Measure L in 1999 and, most recently in June 2016, the generous and supportive Livermore community 
passed the Measure J Facilities Bond.

Measure J funds will be used 
to: 
 

 
Modernize classrooms, science labs and educational technology for 21st century instruction
 

 
Repair aging infrastructure: roofs, plumbing, HVAC and electrical systems
 

 
Renovate facilities for advanced science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and 
Career Technical 
Education (CTE) courses
 

 
Improve safety, including security lighting, fencing, fire safety, and other emergency systems
 

 
Upgrade deteriorated hardscapes, physical education facilities, and pick
-
up/drop
-
off zones
 

 
Increase access to school fac
ilities to better accommodate individuals with disabilities
 
Through these bond measures and developer fees, the LVJUSD has been able to renovate, modernize and construct 
newschools following the Facilities Master Plan. 
 
 
Facilities are maintained through t
he diligent efforts of the site custodial crews and the district maintenance staff. The 
LVJUSD Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the LVJUSD. The principal works with the 
custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ma
intain clean and safe schools. District maintenance staff performs the 
repairs necessary to keep the schools in good working order in a timely manner. A work
-
order process is used to ensure 
efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest
 
priority.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State pr

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Livermore Valley Joint 
Unified School District (LVJUSD) values active parent engagement and believes that parent 
involvement is essential to the success of all students. LVJUSD Board Policy 6020(a) states:
 
 


sustained parent involvement in the education of their children contributes greatly to student achievement and a positive 
school environment. The Superintendent or designee shall work with staff and paren
ts/guardians to develop meaningful 
opportunities at all grade levels for parents/guardians to be involved in district and school activities; advisory, decision
-

 
 
Educational research s
uggests that highly effective schools have a number of features in common, including high levels of 

high levels and have more well
-
rounded
 
educational experiences. LVJUSD parents are welcome partners in our school 
community. There are a range of opportunities for parents to engage with schools, including Parent Teacher Associations 
(PTAs), Parent Faculty Associations (PFAs), sports and activ
ity booster clubs, and other supporter groups. On a monthly 

Communication and Information Council (PCIC). This gathering provides an opportu
nity for parent groups to collaborate 
with each other and representatives of the district regarding events, opportunities, and activities for students and families
. 
This is also a time district representatives share new initiatives and current information 
with parent leaders. In addition, 
parents have the opportunity to share general concerns and ask questions directly to the superintendent. Each school also 
has formal advisory groups including School Site Councils (SSCs) and English Learner Advisory Commit
tees (ELACs) who 
represent other parents at the site and are critical in the development and monitoring of the 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement (SPSA). A representative from each SSC serves on the district Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) 
Adviso
ry Committee, and a member of each ELAC serves on the District English Learner Advisory Council (DELAC), which 
also serves as the LCAP English Learner Advisory Committee. Through these two
-
way systems of parent support and 
engagement, parents, district, an
d school staff have open lines of communication and opportunities to engage in 
meaningful ways with the school community.
 
 
Parents are an integral part of our Jackson Avenue Elementary School environment. We have several opportunities for 
parents to become
 
involved and are open to additional ideas and suggestions. We appreciate the dedication of parents 

possible by driving and chaperoning stu
dents.
 
 
Parents participate in our School Site Council (SSC), Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) and English Learner Advisory 
Committee (ELAC) to provide input and support. Our programs are supported through volunteering, fundraising, 
sponsoring, conducting
 
enrichment activities, and participating on committees. The SSC reviews and approves the School 
Plan for Student Achievement. The SSC also makes recommendations and reviews programs, progress, and student 
achievement. Our ELAC committee in partnership wit
h our PTO organizes our annual Multicultural Night, providing a 
variety of homemade food for the community to eat, and a large variety of performances representing many different 
cultures such as Hispanic/Latino, Filipino, Native American, East Indian, Chi
nese, Afghan, Scottish, and more.

We have an extremely active PTO that supports our school programs both financially and through volunteer efforts. They 
have supported our classrooms with supplemental materials. They provided financial support for the cla
ssrooms and field 
trips. Our PTO also supports many community social activities. The PTO organizes our Holiday Gift Store; weekly ice cream 
sales; and a silent auction and carnival in the spring to raise money for additional supplies, enrichment programs, 
assemblies and more. For more information on how to become involved, please contact the executive assistant to the

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Jackson Avenue Elementary School, in conjunction with LVJUSD, provides a safe, comfortable learning environment that 
contributes to student academic success. 
The Safety Committee meets regularly to update and review the Emergency 
Plan. The school safety plan addresses preparedness and response for a variety of possible disasters such as earthquakes, 
fire, and intruders. We have regular practice drills for all t
hree events. The school maintains emergency supplies, which 
are stored away from the main buildings in an emergency storage container. Visitors are all required to sign in and sign 
out in the school office and wear a badge when visiting the campus. All LVJ
USD school personnel are asked to wear their 
district identification tags. Emergency first
-
aid information, emergency kits, and emergency
-
evacuation maps are posted 
in every classroom. Yard supervisors wear orange vests and are equipped with handheld radio
s. They are on campus to 
provide student supervision before and after school, during recess and lunchtime. All yard supervisors and office staff 
have been trained in the use of the EpiPen (epinephrine injection) and automated external defibrillators (AEDs)
 
in case of 
an emergency. At the beginning of the year, the Emergency Plan was reviewed with all staff. The school safety plan was 
last reviewed, updated and discussed with the school faculty in August 2019.
