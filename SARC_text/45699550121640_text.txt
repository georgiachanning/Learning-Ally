By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Cottonwood Creek Charter School is located in the historic town of Cottonwood in Northern California. Cottonwood Creek 
Charter Sc
hool is sponsored by the Cottonwood School District and offers a quality, tuition free education to K 
-
8 students. 
Our family
-
friendly school schedules are independent study based. This allows parents to have the option of 
homeschooling their students or s
ending them to our site based classrooms for a more traditional classroom education. 
This model ensures that each student, whether home schooled or attending site classes, receives a personalized learning 
plan that focuses on his/her educational strengths 
and needs. Our site based classes are small (approximately 24 students 
per class) to optimize learning and teacher/student interaction. Our site classes are held Monday 
-
 
Thursday mornings. In 
the afternoon, students have the option to select electives in 
Music, Art, Foreign Language and Technology. Fridays are 
reserved for field trips. Field trip days provide educational and hands
-
on learning in nature and the community. Our field 
trips have included: skiing, hiking, visiting local museums, Shasta Dam Tour
, Shasta Caverns, and a Community Service 
Day.
 
 
Our Mission Statement:
 
Students at Cottonwood Creek Charter School will become well rounded participants in their community today as well as 
in the future. We will use a blended learning model that combines 
both site based classes and Personalized Learning to 
develop an individualized program of study for every student, melding "handson" educational opportunities through 
technological resources, educational field trips, local experts and a dedicated, committe
d staff of talented teachers and 
parents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Cottonwood Creek Charter leased the East Cottonwo
od School Campus for 5 years and last year Cottonwood Creek 
Charter School purchased the surplussed campus.  The campus currently is comprised of 21 classrooms, a library, a 
computer lab, one staff room, a multipurpose room with a stage, a school office, a
 
playground and and a large soccer field. 
At the time of publication of this SARC, 100% of all bathroooms on campus were in working condition. A full time custodian 
ensures classrooms, restrooms, and campus grounds are kept clean and safe. Cottonwood Creek
 
Charter School 
administers a scheduled maintenance program to ensure that classrooms and facilities are maintained to a degree of 
adequacy that provides a suitable learning environment.  Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep 
the sch
ool in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure 
efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

on and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the re
quirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
