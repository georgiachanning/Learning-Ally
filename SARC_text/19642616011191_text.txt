Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Our school mission statement: Longley Way is committed to developing responsible, empathetic leaders who respect 
others, persevere, and demonstrate student agency in a safe environment.  Our school tagline:  EVERYONE MATTERS, 
EVERYONE HAS A
 
VOICE, EVERYONE CAN BE A LEADER.
 
 
With almost 500 students, Longley Way Elementary School offers a challenging educational program that is closely 
matched with the developmental and educational needs of each child. Instruction is based on rigorous content
, 

learning. Well
-
trained and dedicated professional teachers effectively use high
-
quality instructional materials and 
technology tools to 
convey learning concepts to students.
 
 
All students have equal access to the core curricular and co
-
curricular resources. Students become literate seekers of 
knowledge. We are proud of the opportunities offered for student support and enrichment during the
 
school year, 
including the library/media center, computer lab, English language arts and math intervention programs, Title I tutoring, 
Game Day PE program, Student Council, after school enrichment clubs, assemblies featuring the arts supported through 
our
 
Parent Teacher Association (PTA), and field trips at each grade level.  We are also an AVID Elementary (TK
-
5) and 
Leader in Me Lighthouse School.
 
 
The school environment is nurturing, safe and supportive for all students, staff and families. We offer oppo
rtunities for 
students to develop leadership skills through our Leader in Me program and a school
-
wide positive behavioral support 
system. The Second Step program guides instruction in positive interpersonal skills. Lessons focus on empathy, problem 
solvin
g, and emotion management. Longley Way Elementary School fervently strives to teach the whole child and prepare 
students to be positive, successful, and contributing members of society.  Our staff has also been Restorative Practices 
trained which we implem
ent in our classrooms and throughout our school community.
 
 
Longley Way was named a 2018 California Distinguished School and a 2019 National Blue Ribbon School.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Our school was built in 1951 and had a major renovation in 1996. At that time we updated classrooms, added air 
conditioning and new flooring, and installed electrical upgrades for computers and other technology. Our restro
oms are 
kept clean by our hardworking and dedicated custodians. A gardening service maintains our school grounds on a weekly 
basis, and major landscaping projects have been achieved through the hard work of our local Boy Scout troop, many of 
whose members 
are working on Eagle Scout projects.
 
 
Our district passed a school building/renovation bond in a local election which led to the modernization of our campus, 
which was completed in the summer of 2015. We have new paint and flooring inside 
classrooms, advanced technology in 
every classroom, new exterior fencing, security lighting, new phone and bell systems and a new library/media center. We 
are very grateful to our citizens and to our school district for having a vision of contemporary and 
efficient buildings to 
house excellent educational programs.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Pa
rental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents help teachers prepare materials and volunteer in the classrooms with students. Our PTA is a strong advocate for 
students and raises money for performing arts assemblies, classroom newspapers, 
library books, and various equipment 
needs that we would otherwise be without. PTA parent volunteers also organize Family Fun Nights for our students and 
families, host Back
-
to
-
School Night and Open House, and coordinate many other events for our students 
and teachers 
throughout the year. Our volunteers are a vital part of our school community. We have high expectations not only for our 
students but for our parents too. We expect parents to read with their children, talk to them about their school work, 
enr
ich their experiences outside of school, and be involved in school activities. An especially important activity is student
-
led conferences, which pushes our students to take ownership of their learning and increase their responsibility. For more 
informatio
n about becoming involved at Longley Way, please contact Principal Travis Long at (626) 821

School Safety Plan (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
To safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, a Comprehensive School Safety Plan has been developed by the Safety 
and Disaster Committee, which consists of classified staff, teachers, and the principal. The committee sets goals for the
 
school to continually improve in 3 areas: School Climate (Students, Parents, and Programs), Emergency Preparedness 
(Disasters and Crisis), and School Environment (Facilities and Campus). The plan addresses various safety issues, including 
creating procedu
res that detect and prevent bullying, ensuring appropriate campus supervision, maintaining disaster kits, 
and monitoring emergency procedures. The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is updated each year and approved by the 
School Site Council and the Board o
f Education.  The plan is reviewed with all staff members at the beginning of each 
school year. Safety drills are held on a regular basis; fire drills are held monthly, earthquake drills are held four times a
 
year, and intruder/lockdown drills are held at 
least once a year. Staff members also receive disaster training on a regular 
basis.
 
 
To ensure student safety, teachers, administrators, and school proctors supervise students on campus before and after 
school, and during breaks and lunch. Longley Way Elem
entary School has a closed campus, and permission is always 

office and must wear the proper identification badge at all times.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-

We are a low
-
funded school district and must therefore use our resources wisely. We use both Title I and Title II money 
to fund part
-
time intervention teachers to support students needing additional academic support. California State funds 
based on the Loc
al Control Funding Formula (LCFF) allow us to hire a part
-
time library aide. Our PTA raises around $15,000 
per year to fund performing arts assemblies, purchase library books and specialized equipment, and provide grade levels 
special programs such as the 

students.
 
 
We warmly welcome all newcomers to Longley Way School. Our goal is to create a school climate that is very caring and 
has high expectations for student
 
effort and achievement.  We believe our strong school community makes us unique and 
a great place for kids.

Under the current Local Control Funding Formula, districts like Arcadia Unified School District, with low numbers of 
unduplicated students receive far less ongoing money to implement the California Academic St
andards compared to 

youth).  These high unduplicated count districts receive supplemental and concentration grant monies to purchase 
materials, hire consultants, and pay for hours of professional development for their instructional and student support 
staffs.
 
 
In the Fall of 2013, the Arcadia Unified School District negotiated an interest
-
based solution for California Academic 
Standards
 
implementation with its bargaining units to add three days to the school calendar for two years starting in the 
2014
-
15 school year. Negotiations produced an agreement to spread the three days of additional paid time over seven 
early release days with dev
elopment time of 2.5 hours per day built into the schedule.  Since 2015, AUSD leadership has 
negotiated annual agreements with its bargaining units to continue the additional three days for professional 
development.
 
 
In the Spring of 2014, a committee grew
 

Council (C
-
TAC) with the task of putting legs to the plan. C
-
TAC is a representative group made up of bargaining unit 
members and management team members who were charged with
 
serving as an advisory committee to the District in the 
implementation of the district
-
wide California Academic Standards Collaboration Time supporting TK
-
12 instructional 
programs both vertically and horizontally, as they made dramatic instructional and 
curricular shifts.
 
 
The commitment from both our bargaining units and management was to build research
-
based professional development 
around small collaborative working groups. Each group would be designed intentionally to have a vertical alignment of 
teac
hers from TK
-
12 engaged in the work together.
 
 
In late Spring of 2014, the C
-
TAC committee reached out to all certificated staff to assist with generating ideas for the 
content of the Collaboration Days. The committee, after reviewing and discussing the ma
ny ideas that were submitted 
and looking at survey data, generated a list of themes which became the foundation of the Collaboration Days and assisted 
in guiding the development of a Course Group Catalogue. The planning of the Collaboration Days was resear
ch based, 
focused on meaningful work, teacher choice, flexibility, and ongoing commitment. The Professional Development was 
designed around teacher interests that included creating autonomous choice for teachers and support providers in 
relation to where t
hey felt they could best contribute their training, talents, interests, and education, by participating in 
Small Working Groups (SWaG) and engaging with other professionals to continue the real work of implementing the 
California Academic Standards.  C
-
TAC
 
continues to act as the advisory body for the Collaboration Days, reviewing survey 
data and requests for course offerings, and considering suggestions for improvements to the program.
 
 
Each SWaG is led by a self
-
selected Facilitator from amongst the vario
us stakeholder groups and has been charged with 
collaborating both with colleagues at their own site and with fellow professionals from other district sites. Mentor
-
leaders 
support Facilitators by providing support throughout implementation of this profess
ional development. The crystal
-
clear 
goals of the Collaboration Days include producing a comprehensive and fully articulated Arcadia California Academic 
Standards Core Curriculum in English
-
Language Arts and Mathematics; to research and make recommendation
s for 
curriculum and instructional shifts towards a more personalized approach to learning in the Social Sciences, Sciences, 
Foreign Languages, Physical Education, Electives, Visual and Performing Arts, Character Education, Technology 
implementation, Engli
sh
-
Language Development, Next Generation Science Standards implementation, Project
-
Based 
Learning, Innovative Instruction, Google Classroom and various online and Open Educational Resources, and Special 
Education from a Transitional Kindergarten to Grade 1
2 perspective. Data continues to be collected from the SWaGs 
through group evaluations and is then disaggregated and shared through various modalities to each stakeholder group.

In recent years, additional professional development resources have been 
designated for Mathematics and English
-
Language curriculum development and 21st Century instructional skill development, including National Council of 
Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) conferences, Thinking Maps, and Write From the Beginning, in support of Ca
lifornia 
Academic Standards implementation, Illuminate data and assessment system, AVID, Advanced Placement, and Next 
Generation Science Standards. At the high school level, data indicated that a large segment of potentially college
-
bound 
students were not
 
being provided access and opportunity to pursue honors and college
-
level courses, as their high
-
achieving classmates were. Leadership worked with teachers to engage in professional development around the themes 
of Advanced Placement (AP) open access and e
quity for all students over the past two years. Professional Development 
resources have been designated to send teachers, counselors and leadership to the local and regional College Board/A.P. 
Forums. Continued professional development will be pursued at t
he national level.
 
 
Full implementation of the Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) program continues to be a focus of 
professional development dollars over the past seven years.
 
 
Individual school sites have been tasked with working with the Instructional Coaches to conduct professional development 
around the themes of the California Academic  Standards, including rigor, focus, coherence, instructional strategies, shifts 
in curricu
lum, pacing and instructional materials, writing instruction and problem
-
solving.  Arcadia Instructional Coaches 
have become regional professional development leaders by presenting at conferences and through their instituting the 
San Gabriel Valley Instruc
tional Coaches Consortium.
 
 
Staff development topics from  2012

2018 school years have included effective instruction and critical thinking, 
implementation of the electronic grade book, the California Academic Standards, identification, development and cur
ation 
of online resources, pedagogical shifts, brain research and Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Innovative Instruction.
