School Description
 
Teague Elementary School is a diverse learning environment that is student
-
centered and 
community
-
driven.  Our school belongs to the 
community and all stakeholders work collaboratively 
to provide the optimal academic environment by cultivating a welcoming environment in which 
student success, academic and social, is at the forefront of all school objectives.  Teague is nestled 
in West F
resno and is truly a community hub in which many of our families reside in very close 
proximity to the school.  Following the "Central Way", Teague places great importance in meeting 
students, "where they are" academically.  This is something that the staf
f works diligently towards. 
Our mission is to offer quality instruction in the core subject areas.  Teague has a staff of highly 
qualified teachers who utilize a myriad of instructional strategies to help our students experience 
academic success.  Through 
direct instruction, teachers are able to educate students by sharing 
their expertise.  They effectively differentiate instruction to meet a broader range of the needs that 
students may have.  This helps us obtain the primary goal of creating the optimal ac
ademic 
environment, which in turn allows Teague staff to build and teach the "whole child."
 
 
Central Unified School District has made a commitment to address the socio
-
emotional needs of 
students.  The belief is that students at Teague and throughout the d
istrict, need support that 
expand beyond academics.  We have incorporated a program called Second Step that serves to 
educate students on issues involving being a good citizen, building self
-
worth/self
-
esteem, and 
understanding resilience.  The Second Step
 
program is used within the classroom setting, but it's 
messages address concepts that will benefit students in their lives.  Our students learn about 
empathy, perseverance, bullying prevention, and fair play.
 
 
The staff works to contribute to our students
 
being well
-
rounded and able to compete, 
academically, on a level outside of their community.  The interventions that are in place at Teague 
are geared towards assisting students that may have intense learning deficiencies and challenging 
those students wh
o may be functioning at a higher academic level.  The reading labs at Teague are 
staffed by qualified instructors who are well trained at assessing students and supporting them 
within the regular classroom setting as well as in a pullout program.  Many of 
the teachers at Teague 
participate in tutorial programs that offer tutoring in core subject areas (Math, English Language 
Arts, etc.).  Teague Elementary has a Reading Intervention Program that has been rebuilt to 
accommodate a three
-
tier program. Tier one
 
of the program provides the opportunity for 
certificated teachers to support the reading instruction for students in the classroom by providing 
core instruction to all students.  Tier two is based on F&P scores where students are identified for 
additional
 
reading intervention.   Students two years below grade level receive instruction in a small 
group setting based on their needs.  Support is provided through our site literacy team that 
provides three reading teachers and several Teaching fellows.  Each te
am will push into classrooms 
and support the tier two students. Students identified more than two years below reading levels 
will then be in tier three where students are pulled out into intensive groups of no more than 5 
students at a time. Students will 
receive specialized instruction in reading and literacy skill 
development.
 
 
The commitment to address the needs of English Learners (EL) is evident.  Teachers have a block of 
instructional time per day in which they work to help English learners acquire th
e skills necessary 
for them to be successful academically.   Teague will continue to use the ELPAC test and other 
assessments to determine the learning needs of our EL learners.  Teague is also looking to continue 
with parent classes designed to assist par
ents in English language acquisition as well.

Lastly, the caring and support that staff gives to students is an added bonus.  Our staff, many of which are veterans, take g
reat pride in 
our students.  They have developed a positive rapport with 
families and have a sense of urgency regarding our students academic and 
social success.   This is why our daily saying is to "Take pride in your school, in your education, and in yourselves."
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is requi
red by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs)
 
are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an 
LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should con
tact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Central Unified Schools maintain current and standards
-
aligned instructional materials in good repai
r, for all students. Materials are locally adopted and 
reflect programs currently approved by the State Board of Education. All materials currently adopted reflect the most recent 
SBE adoptions and support 
the current California Frameworks.
 
 
Every student,
 
including English Learners, Special Education, and other special populations have their own textbook. In the case of class se
ts, those sets 
augment individual texts that have been issued to individual students. These class sets are made based on a commitm
ent of the district administration 
and the governing board and are not the product of any state requirement.
 
 
All instructional materials are subject to a school and district review process. Materials may be piloted and all materials t
hat are selected and 
recommended for local adoption are reviewed by teachers, administration, and any parents who wish to review the materials. Th
e Central Unified Board 
of Trustees reviews and adopt based on the recommendation of the district adoption committees and Education
al Services.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Parents associated with Teague are active in the daily ope
rations of our school.  We have staff members who are also parents of Teague students who 
regularly volunteer their time and energy to supporting activities.  Our parent group, known as the Parent Faculty Club (PFC)
, are very active.  They raise 
funds and 
use those funds to contribute to student body, athletics, and teachers.  Parents at Teague are also part of the community cen
ter and Central 
Community Church located across the street from the school.  Parents bring resources from those stakeholders onto c
ampus which translates to more 
success for our students.  Parents are encouraged to join the School Site Council, ELAC, and various events geared towards ma
king Teague a place where 
parents feel welcome and a part of what goes on. Translation and interpret
ation services are provided.
 
 
Parents continue to have opportunities to take parenting classes here at Teague. Classes are tentatively slated to begin at t
he beginning of the second 
semester of the 2019
-
2020 school year.

School Safety Plan
 
Student safety at Teague Elementary School is paramount to the community.   The information provided by our Annual School Saf
ety Survey helps assess 
our safety practices and adjust as 
necessary. Supervision is provided from 7:30 am when the campus opens and concludes at 6:00 pm when the campus 
closes. Staff is strategically posted for duty throughout the day to ensure supervision and safety. Ongoing surveillance of t
he school via securi
ty cameras 
is a definite plus.  These cameras are monitored by administrators. The perimeter of the campus and it's entrance points are 
regularly monitored. All 
visitors check in at the office through a system called "Raptor" and receive a badge to designa
te to all site staff the person has registered in the office. 
The campus is equipped with an intercom system that reaches each classroom as well as the site phone system.
 
 
A school alarm system can be armed with ease and is used for emergency drills as 
well as fire drills, lockdowns, evacuation drills, etc.  These drills are 
practiced monthly.
 
 
Teague's Site Emergency Response Plan entails management, planning, first aid, food/water/supplies, traffic, public informati
on, search and 
accountability, studen
t assembly/shelter and release, grounds and maintenance, bilingual translators. The Site Emergency Response Plan can be acces

The primary focus of staff development continues to be a focus on positive behavior intervention supports (PBIS) using a tier
ed system.  Professional 
development (PD) meetings focus on various strategies geared to 
address the diverse needs of students at Teague Elementary School.  A PBIS team was 
assembled and meets regularly to discuss school
-
wide progress in addressing the needs of at
-
risk students and the student population as a whole.  
Teachers also attend works
hops and conferences outside of school giving them an opportunity to collaborate with other educators dealing with similar 
issues around school culture and climate.  Also, during the 2019
-
2020 school year, all teachers are receiving training on using the S
cience curriculum and 
proper delivery of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Teachers at Teague participate in CGI training regarding math st
rategies and have hosted 
training and provided opportunities for other educators to observe CGI strategies wi
thin the classroom setting at Teague.
 
 
Teachers at Teague are also provided professional development at the district level through district
-
wide grade
-
level collaboration that affords them 
opportunities to address information regarding assessments, BEST pr
actices for effective instruction, differentiation, technology, professional learning 
communities, and planning.  Teachers are supported with substitutes if PD is during the day. Most PD occurs on Wednesdays dur
ing principal days. 
Teachers are also provide
d with subs to meet with the principal for goal
-
setting meetings and data review meetings.

Types of Services Funded
 
The bulk of Teague's funding continues to be in support of providing highly qualified staff (HQ) for the instruction of our s
tudents. Student literacy and a 
commitment to instruction that is differentiated continue to be a primary focal point in 2019
-
2020.  iSchool funding has been made available to teachers 
an opportunity to purchase various items above and beyond the regular classroom materials.  This will a
llow them to have access to needed 
supplementary materials geared towards enhancing student's learning experiences.  Also, other funding has been allotted to sc
hools for the purpose of 
creating incentives for improving attendance as well as rewarding stude
nts for placing emphasis on their education.
 
 
Teague's budget indicates strident use of funds used for incentives geared toward celebrating positive behaviors.  Funds are 
used to support educational 
field trips and to purchase "SWAG!" such as medals, certi
ficates, etc.
