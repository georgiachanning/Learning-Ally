A Message from the Principal:
 
Kennedy Elementary School opened its doors in August 2013 as a Transitional 
Kindergarten 
-
 
6th 
grade elementary school. I invite you to explore the Kennedy Elementary Annual School 
Accountability Report Card, which provides valuable information about our school's instructional 
programs, academic achievement, classroom materials, s
chool safety, facilities, and staff. 
Understanding our educational program, student achievement, and curriculum development can 
assist both our school and the community in ongoing program improvement. Parents will find 
valuable information about our academ
ic achievement, professional staff, curricular programs, 
instructional materials, safety procedures, classroom environment, and condition of facilities. 
Kennedy Elementary provides a warm, stimulating environment where students are actively 
involved in lea
rning academics and positive values. Students receive a standards
-
based, challenging 
curriculum by dedicated professional staff. Instruction is based on the individual needs of the 
students. Ongoing evaluation of student progress and achievement helps us r
efine the instructional 
program so students can achieve academic proficiency. Staff and parents work together to create 
a learning environment that promotes academic and social development, teaches responsibility 
and pride, and models learning as a lifelon
g adventure. We welcome any suggestions or questions 
you may have about the information contained in this report or about the school. Together through 
our hard work, our students will be challenged to reach their maximum potential.

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

State Priority: Parental Involvement

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Our School Site Council, wh
ich includes parent members, and our ELAC provide advice and guidance for the school administration. We encourage parents 
to participate at special events, such as the Read Across America Week, parent nights centered on helping children to be succ
essful in
 
school, parent 
conferences, Eagle Boosters, parent volunteers, field trips, as well as programs and celebrations throughout the school year.
 
We offer various workshops 
for parents ranging from helping with homework, discipline at home, how to navigate par
ent/teacher conferences, and more. We are starting a new 
series of workshops that will be facilitated by parents and teachers. Attending Parenting Partners workshops is a great way t
o stay involved with your 
child's education. In addition to Parenting Part
ners workshops, we have invited all of our Kennedy families to join us monthly for informational sessions 
covering drug awareness, bullying, online libraries for the family, fire safety in the home, positive discipline, reading wit
h children, and math game
s for 
the whole family. These sessions are scheduled one per month in the school library.
 
Our Eagle Boosters Club is a parent driven fundraising group which 
has goals to support students and staff by funding events and activities that are not supported thr
ough the regular school budgets.
 
 
If you would like more information about parent engagement opportunities and events, please contact Mrs. Estrada at (559) 595

School Safety Plan
 
The first goal of Kennedy Elementary is to ensure a safe campus. We have adopted, and are trained in, the district s
afety plan and have modified the 
procedures to meet the needs of the Kennedy campus. The staff and students participate in monthly emergency drills. Administr
ative staff members 
supervise our campus before, during,  and after school. Classified and certifi
cated personnel also supervise during the break and lunch periods. We have 
implemented a Positive Behavior Intervention Supports program identifying how students are expected to behave throughout the 
school.  Kennedy's 
EAGLE expectations are to Eagerly Lea
rn, Act Responsibly, Give Respect, Listen Attentively, and Exhibit Excellence. These expectations are the same for 
staff and students.  The PBIS program shows students what it looks like to  practice those expectations, and has put into pla
ce opportunities
 
for students 
to be recognized  for positive behavior. Kennedy has been recognized by the State of California as a "Gold Medal" school for 
our Positive Discipline 
programs. This year we expect to reach "Platimum" status. Kennedy has  a school
-
wide anti
-
bul
lying policy. The Student Agenda/Handbook includes the 
Positive Behavior expectations, rewards, and the steps to correct inappropriate behavior.
 
 
Kennedy has added a crossing guard to assist students coming to and from school at our busiest 
crosswalk. Staff supervise the pick
-
up area each day 
after school. Our site is fenced and there is one open gate at the front of the campus where all visitors must enter. Classro
om doors are locked during 
the day, and the School Resource Officer is availab
le if needed.
 
 
 
Staff have developed a Code System for emergency response regarding student behavior. Support staff, including the psychologi
st, Special Education 
teachers and staff, County staff (IRC), and administrators are all connected via group text
 
for immediate response in classrooms and on campus when 
necessary. Kennedy has reduced the number of student suspensions significantly over the last 5 years, due to having these pro
cesses in place.
 
 
 
The Kennedy Elementary School Safety Plan is updated 
every year with the input from staff, students, teachers, parents, SSC, and ELAC. It is then approved 
by the School Site Council and the School Board.
