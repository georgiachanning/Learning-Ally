About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Plann
ed Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Public S
chool Construction. The results of this survey are available at the KCUSD Business Office.
 
 
Jefferson Elementary School has 21 classrooms, a library and an administration building. The main campus was built in 1964. A
dditional relocatable 
classrooms were constructed in 1996 and 1998.  A multi
-
purpose room was constructed in 2009. Over the summer of 2018, modernization of the main 
office was completed along with installation of a shade structures and renovation of the 500 building.   In addi
tion, in 2019 solar panels were installed in 
the parking lot and six classrooms were recarpeted in the 100 and 200 wings.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a 
timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The Directo
r of Maintenance, Custodial 
Supervisor, and the site principals work cooperatively with the custodial staff to dev
elop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar f
or dollar basis to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major 
repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern at Jefferson Elementary School. Before, during, and after school, the c
ampus is monitored by 
assigned staff. All visitors must sign in at the office and wear appropriate identification while on campus. 
 
Parent volunteers are also required to complete 
a parent volunteer application.  The comprehensive school safety plan is designed to assist in preparing for emergencies, man
aging emergency response 
efforts, and maintaining a safe school environment. The p
lan requires identification of security needs, development of prevention and intervention 
techniques, evaluation of physical facilities, and communication with staff and students. Components of the plan include: chi
ld abuse reporting 
procedures, procedures
 
for teacher notification of dangerous pupils, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress from schoo
l, 
sexual harassment policies, and suspension and expulsion policies. The safety plan is reviewed annually, updated as needed, a
nd
 
fully compliant with 
federal and state regulations. The plan was last reviewed/updated February 2019 and discussed with staff on August 13, 2019. 
 
An updated copy is 
available to the public at the school office.
