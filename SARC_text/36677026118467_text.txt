By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

John L. Golden Elementary is proud of its high standards regarding campus maintenance and general housekeeping 
practices. Staff and students enjoy the benefits of having a well
-
maintained and beautiful campus.
 
 
School staff and the 
maintenance department work together to ensure playgrounds, classrooms, and campus grounds are 
well
-
maintained. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) oversees a work order process enabling school staff to 
communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repair
s, or special projects. The school secretary is responsible for 
the preparation and submission of work orders to M&O for resolution. Emergency situations are given high priority and 
resolved immediately by site or district custodial staff.
 
 
The principal h
as an open door policy and encourages the custodian and the director of maintenance and operations 
(M&O) to discuss any maintenance related issues associated with campus upkeep, safety, classroom space, equipment, 
upcoming events, work orders (submitted an
d outstanding), and special requests. The director of M&O meets with the 
custodian to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the school site, and a summary of the inspection findings is forwarded 
to the principal.
 
 
Schools are required by state law to condu
ct a formal inspection annually of designated areas and systems and then 
prepare a report of the current condition of facilities.  The School Site Inspection table illustrated in this report identif

time day custodian is responsible for keeping the campus clean and fully 

ca
feteria after meals are served. Every morning before school begins, the day custodian inspects school facilities for safety 
hazards and maintenance issues that require attention before staff and students arrive on campus. Any graffiti or signs of 
vandalism
 
are removed immediately. Restrooms are checked frequently throughout the day as a proactive measure in 
keeping facilities stocked, safe, and sanitary.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil A
chievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California A
lternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achie
vement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance
 
to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parental involvement is 
very important to the Etiwanda School District and John L. Golden Elementary School.  This state 
priority is part of LCAP and is critical for our school to continue to strive for excellence in education.
 
 
Etiwanda School District organized multiple communi
ty forums that allowed parents to participate in discussions with site 
administrators from across the district and district administrators.  During these sessions, parents were provided with a 
presentation by our director of LCAP and communications about L
ocal Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP).  Parents 
then participated in small group discussions to provide feedback.  In August of 2019, the district and each school site 
provided opportunities for parents to provide feedback for the direction of the di
strict and school site.  This was done at 
Back to School Night in an effort to encourage parental involvement through parent surveys that were available 
electronically or paper. Additionally, at John L. Golden Elementary, an additional survey was sent to p
arents in grades 3
-
5 
to provide feedback for direction of after
-
school activities parents and students would be interested in for the current 
school year.  This has helped to shape a variety of new programs we now offer here at Golden.
 
 
Parents are encoura

committees, and volunteering at the school. The staff welcomes parent assistance in the classroom, library, preparing 
classroom materials, and chaperoning fi
eld trips. Back to School Night, Open House, student programs and performances, 
Family Movie Nights, Reindeer Lane, and PTA
-
sponsored activities provide many opportunities for parents to interact with 

 
program. The School Site Council (SSC), English Language Advisory 
Council, Parent Teacher Association (PTA), and African American Parent and Educator Advisory Committee (AAPEAC) 
enable parents to provide oversight and input on the school budget, activitie
s, and educational programs. Parents who 
would like to get more involved or volunteer their time may contact the school secretary (Laura Jordan) or clerk (Lorene 
Lord) at (909) 463
-
9105.
 
 
School
-
to
-
home communication takes place in a variety of formats. Th
e principal issues a bimonthly newsletter to update 
parents on what is happening in school, upcoming events, seasonal topics, PTA meeting dates, health and safety tips, 
fundraising projects, and student recognition. The school website features general info
rmation about the school and its 
activities, programs, and staff. The school marquee, flyers, automated telephone system, classroom newsletters, and 
parent conferences are used to convey important messages, reminders, and announcements concerning students 
and 
school activities. We also post pictures on social media to keep parents involved with student, classroom, and school 
activities.

The Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan was developed for John L. Golden Elementary in collaboration with local 
agencies and district administration to 
fulfill Senate Bill 187 requirements. Components of this plan include child abuse 
reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for 
safe arrival and departure from school, anti
-
bullying p
olicy, sexual harassment policy, and dress code policy. The most 
current school safety plan was reviewed and updated in September.  Parent and staff representatives reviewed and 
approved the School Safety Plan during a School Site Council meeting in Octobe
r.  In addition, the school ELAC parent 
group and our resource officer reviewed and local fire department approved the plan.
