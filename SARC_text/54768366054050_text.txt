About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, eve
ry school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all l
ocal educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Ad
ditionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Our school and district transitioned to the Common Core Sta
te Standards during the 2013
-
14 school year. We have not officially adopted new core 
curriculum since our previous adoptions listed below, with the exception of Grades TK
-
5 in English
-
language arts. We have contracted with our local 
Tulare County Office of
 
Education and developed Units of Study in English
-
language Arts (ELA) and Math. Many grade levels utilize materials from our 
current ELA adoption, and both our previous ELA and History
-
Social Science adoptions for these ELA units. For our math units, we h
ave used materials 
from EngageNY, Georgia Units from the Georgia Department of Education, Illustrative Mathematics, North Carolina Mathematics, 
and YouCubed. In 
2016, we piloted and adopted Wonders (McGraw Hill Education) ELA curriculum for Kindergarten an
d Transitional Kindergarten. Additionally, we 
purchased two supplemental programs from Voyager Sopris Learning in August 2016 for reading intervention: Read Well (Grades K
-
3) and Language! 
Live (Grades 4
-
5). In 2017, we adopted Wonders (McGraw Hill Educati
on) ELA curriculum for Second Grade. In 2018, we adopted Wonders (McGraw Hill 
Education) ELA curriculum for grades 1, 3, 4, and 5. In December of 2019, we adopted Literacy Footprints (Pioneer Valley) Gui
ded Reading materials for 
grades TK

education population and the Californi
a Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate ac
hievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

School Safety Plan
 
A comprehensive School Safety Plan is reviewed and revised annually. We have made adjustments to simplify the safety drill pr
ocess for teachers. We 
have discussed the following four common responses to a given safety issue: 1) Evacuate (Fire) 2) Shelter (E
arthquake) 3) Lockout (Warning) and 4) 
Lockdown (Danger). The plan was reviewed by the Principal and Assistant Principal on August 8, 2019.
 
 
Safety materials were distributed and discussed with faculty at a staff development on August 5, 2019. The safety p
lan was discussed and input was given 
at the School Site Council Meeting on October 30, 2019. The School Safety Plan was approved by School Site Council on October
 
30, 2019. The School 
Safety Plan was brought to School Site Council on December 5, 2019 and 
input was given by a Battalion Chief from the Tulare County Fire Department.
 
 
Key components of the safety plan include: Emergency Plan, Additional Safety Procedures and Strategies, Communication, Annual
 
Review/Testing, and 
Resources/Utilities.

teachers have participated in: Math Lesson Labs (Co

Math Number Talks, Fractions, Tape Diagrams, ELA Units of Study, K
-
2 Literacy 
Centers, Writing Unit pacing, Next Generation Science Standards (4th and 5th grade), and English Language Development (ELD). 
On
-
site professional 
development has been delivered 
through after
-
school Teaching and Learnings from our Academic Coaches and Administration. Topics have included: 
English Language Development, Writing, Guided Reading, Mathematical Practices, Math Fluency Games, Close Reading, Academic Co
nversations, and 
Le
sson Design. Professional Development opportunities have also been provided by our district. These include: Google Training,
