Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

It was determined that each RUSD school had sufficient and good qual
ity textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab 
equipment, where appropriate, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or
 
instructional materials, or both, in core 
subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a 
6
-
year cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making the textbooks used in t
he school the most 
current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to 
the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are 
avai
lable for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption
 
 
Riverside Unified School District adopts instructional materials on a regular schedule based on State adoptions. All 
students receive appropriate, up
-
to
-
date instructional materials for
 
use in the classroom and at home. All materials 
currently in use have been selected by the staff with parent input, and approved by the Board of Education according to 
state adoption requirements. Teachers are provided training in the use of new materials

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP]
 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight
 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant co
gnitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or program
s 
of study.

Note: The number of 
students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number 
of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentage
s are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula

scores.
