By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Description: Pueblo Vista Magnet School is a Dual Immersion/ E
nvironmental Studies school that provides children in 
grades TK
-
5 with a rigorous and engaging program integrating environmental sciences with all areas of the curriculum in 
Spanish and in English.  Assemblies, field trips, and hands
-
on projects provide ex
periences that connect students to their 
community and build a solid academic foundation.  The school garden, culinary kitchen, science lab, library, and computer 
lab provide unique opportunities for student learning.
 
 
The students at Pueblo Vista Magnet S
chool are served by 18 credentialed classroom teachers, science teacher, 
intervention teacher, and a part
-
time support staff that includes Special Education teachers (resource, speech/language, 
school psychologist), physical education K
-
3, instrumental tea
cher (4th
-
5th), credentialed nurse and nurse assistant, two 
instructional assistants, and a bilingual community liaison.  We take pride in the partnerships we have formed with the 
Boys and Girls Club, Napa Library, Napa Valley Museum, Napa Waste and Recycl
ing, Connolly Ranch, and other community 
organizations.
 
 
Mission Statement: With a passion for dual immersion and environmental stewardship, Pueblo Vista Magnet promotes 
high academic achievement through rich language instruction and integration of environ
mental sciences with a rigorous 
core curriculum.  Students will leave Pueblo Vista bilingual, bicultural and bi
-
literate in both Spanish and English. Carefully 
designed inquiry
-
based units provide learning experiences that allow students to communicate, co
llaborate, and think 
critically about local and global issues.  Teachers partner with parents and local community resources to connect learning 
to the natural world.  As a result, Pueblo Vista students will develop an understanding of the interrelationship
s among 
science, the environment, languages, diverse cultures, and their world.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
In the summer of 2000 the entire original school 
underwent remodeling.  1.8 million dollars of work was completed on 
the interior of the classrooms, office, multi
-
use room and additional resource rooms.  A new portable building was brought 
in to provide offices for Resource, ELD, Reading and the school p
sychologist.  The entire campus was modernized allowing 
technology to be advanced to the 21st century throughout the school.  The learning environment is much cleaner and 
brighter, allowing for a better learning environment.  The library and computer lab w
ere connected to develop a media 
center and the front office was expanded to allow for a more welcoming environment.  Also located on our campus are 
the Boys and Girls Club of Napa after school program.  Heating and air conditioning were updated in the sum
mer of 2000.  
Through the efforts of parent clubs and community groups, our playgrounds were updated as well in the year 2000.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASP
P] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eig
ht and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant 
cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or progr
ams 
of study.

Parents are 
encouraged to work in the classroom, participate in school committees, join the Pueblo Vista Magnet Parent 
Faculty Club, and assist in the classroom, library, garden or other areas on the school site. We offer classes for parents 
such as English and Spanis
h Classes.  Monthly we invite parents to monthly meetings called Parent Link, these agendas 
are driven by parent interest.   We also hold informational meetings such as coffee with the principal and quarterly ELAC 
and Title 1 meetings.  Parent input and pa
rticipation on the School Site Council, English Learners Advisory Committee, and 
other committees and school organizations are valued and appreciated by the school staff.  The parent faculty club and 
school sponsor fundraisers along with school beautificat
ion and improvement projects which promote school spirit.   For 
further information on parent involvement opportunities, please contact Helen Rocca, Principal at 707

being has resulted in a campus that is safe from violence, 
drugs, and crime.  Occasional 
graffiti occurs after hours or on weekends and is removed or repaired as quickly as possible.

Discipline, Sexual Harassment, Dealing with Dangerous Pupils, Cr

Pueblo Vista is a magnet school from the 2 phase of magnet schools in NVUSD. Pueblo Vista is no longer federal funded 
but maintains the characteristics of a magnet school.  The Magnet 
requires all magnet schools receive 30 hours of 
professional development in both systemic reforms and thematic implementation. The teachers will receive professional 
development around the school's goals; Professional Learning Communities, Common Core, Com
mon Formative 
Assessments and creating Environmental Science units that focus on language standards and NGSS. Most professional 
development is done on Wednesdays during the contractual time. The leadership team has attended a conference for 
Professional Le
arning Communities with the DuFour's and future teams will attend as well. This will ensure collaboration 
with coherence and consistency throughout the school and leadership team. Teachers are supported with the 
implementation of professional development f
rom both our internal and external coaches on the implementation of 
school
-
wide strategies, state
-
adopted materials, and thematic magnet units. Teachers use student writing and data from 
common formative assessments to reflect on best practices and modify 
instruction when needed.
