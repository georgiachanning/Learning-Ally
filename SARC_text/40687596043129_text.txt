In 2012 the Dana School community worked together to develop a specific vision statement which 
has been the focus for our school for these past 8 years. Through the vision development process 
we prioritized communication skills, specifi
cally speaking, listening, and writing as areas in need of 
deeper focus and attention. Over the past four years we have developed practices which allow 
Dana students to experience quality writing, listening and speaking instruction so that when these 
stude
nts leave our school they are confident and able communicators. In 2018 we updated our 
Dana school vision. Our new vision statement is more parent and student friendly and still focuses 
on communication skills as well as character traits.
 
 
Students are exp
osed to a variety of writing strategies such as Step up to Writing and Thinking Maps 
Writing curriculum. Students engage in multiple opportunities to speak, both informally through 
group and partner work or individual answers to questions and formally thro
ugh short speeches. 
Students learn to use rubrics to analyze their own speaking abilities as well as those of their peers. 
Students work together to assist each other in becoming more articulate speakers.
 
 
At Dana School, teachers collaborate on a regular 
basis to develop lessons, plan strategies, create 
assessments, analyze student assessment data, and formulate a plan to meet the varying needs of 
our student population. Our teachers are highly qualified and dedicated to our students and their 
families.
 
 
W
e provide students with many extracurricular activities. We offer monthly spirit and dress
-
up 
days, as well as many enriching learning experiences such as field trips and assemblies. Our PTO is 
very active in supporting our school. The Dana Diplomats (stud
ent council) and our  Random Acts 
of Kindness club support our school through service projects and daily positive message 
announcements to our students. Our 4th
-
6th grade students participate in an interactive program 
each year to deepen their understandin
g of Social Studies topics (Walk through the American 
Revolution, Walk through Ancient Civilizations, and Walk through California.)  Students participate 

opportu
nities to participate in school performances and classroom art projects throughout the 
school year.
 
 
Dana has prioritized student access to technology and we are pleased to state that our entire school 
now has 1:1 access to chromebooks! We are well on our 
way to reaching this goal!  The site holds 
licenses for several helpful software and Web
-
based programs including Scholastic Reading 
Inventory, Rosetta Stone, Kidspiration, Brainpop, RAZ kids, Dreambox learning, Reflex Math and 
Flocabulary.
 
 
With dedicated
 
teachers and staff, helpful and devoted parents, and a supportive, involved 
community, Dana is a highly effective school. Dana students are well represented in district and 
county writing contests, Destination Imagination competitions, and in other academ
ic and athletic 

Aloud Contest. Academic and Character awards are presented following each trimester.
 
 

 
challenge, and inspire students 
through the power of learning. School Vision Statement:   At Dana Elementary we will be effective 
communicators in speaking, listening, and writing. We will take responsibility for our words, 
actions, attitudes, and learnin
g. We will show respect, empathy, and kindness towards others.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Dana Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for learning. Built in 1960 and modernized in 2002, Dana Elementary
 
School is situated on 
10.4 acres. The school buildings span 41,228 square feet, consisting of a cafeteria, kitchen, office, library, and classrooms
. The campus features, in effect, 
three playgrounds. The kindergarten playground, in the southeast corner of
 
the campus, features a jungle gym, blacktop, and grass area. Behind the 
school is a large playground with two playground structures, one on each side of the campus. The school installed a new well 
on campus, removed the 
old well in the summer of 2007, and
 
refurbished the area in the summer of 2008.
 
 
With money earned from a grant, teachers developed the area near Room 32 as a garden, featuring six above
-
ground beds. With School Improvement 
Program money, the school purchased several additional picnic table
s for lunch areas and for outside learning stations. The school recently upgraded to 
new electrical service, which will be online in November of 2017.  And switch from septic to sewer service was completed in s
ummer 2018.
 
 
Dana Elementary School is a close
d campus. Many people visit the campus to volunteer in the classroom and participate in school events. Parents and 
visitors are welcomed and required to check
-

n to the school 
office upon departure. During lunch, recesses, and before and after school, adults supervise students and school grounds, suc
h as the cafeteria and 
recreation area, to ensure a safe and orderly environment.
 
 
Safety concerns are the No. 1 pr
iority of maintenance and operations. District maintenance supervisors are proactive and conduct inspections at school 
sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely m
anner. A wor
k
-
order process 
is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The District maintenance staff
 
has indicated that 100 percent 
of all toilets on school grounds are in working order.
 
 
A team of custodians ensure
s classrooms, campus grounds, and restrooms are kept clean and safe. A scheduled maintenance program is administered 
by Lucia Mar Unified School District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well maintained and provide a suitable 
learning envir
onment. A 
summary of these standards is available at the school office or at the District office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter 
Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible stu
dents 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The pe
rcentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the District to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. Th
e Plan provides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 within
 
their Safe School Plans: 
current status of school crime; child abuse reporting procedures; disa
ster procedures, both routine and emergency; policies related to suspension and 
expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a schoolwide dress code; safe ingress and egress 
of pupils, parents, and school 
employees; safe and 
orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and updates it as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Pla
n, are reviewed with school 
and District staff in the fall, at the st
art of each school year. The Injury, Illness & Prevention Plan was last updated and reviewed with school staff in 
October 2019.

Career Technical Education Programs
 
The Board of Education realized that students have varying academic interests and aptitudes, and that they need to be better 
prepared for options other 
than a four
-
year university directly from high school, particularly in light of the rapidly changing workforce technology and employment 
environments in 
many industry sectors. Therefore, the Board of Education sought to support Programs of Study to ensure 
that all students graduating from the Lucia Mar 
Unified School District have the preparation necessary for success in any post
-
secondary pursuit, whether it is university studies, technical training, 
workforce placement, military enlistment, or service as 
a community volunteer. 
 
 
As vocational education evolved in the 21st century, it became known as Career Technical Education (CTE). Business owners, tr
ade union leaders and 
educators came together to change how occupational and technical subject matter were
 
delivered in high school, college and technical training 
environments. This resulted in the need to develop robust and rigorous curriculum provided in a cyclical continuum that engag
es participants in the most 
common tasks and skills required in a broad u
mbrella of employment opportunities within a specific industry sector. High School Career Pathways provide 
the first two to three years of instruction and skill development in this scenario.

Pathway programs in LMUSD are designed so that students are 
able to gain at least one industry certification, or equivalent skill measurement, to provide 
a competitive advantage in the job market. Additionally, curriculum will coincide with community college career certificate a
nd associate degree 
programs in same/
similar industry areas and in some cases allow students to earn college credit for their coursework while still in high schoo
l. This will 
shorten the time it takes students to earn post
-
secondary degrees/certificates and enter the skilled workforce. The Ca
lifornia Department of Education 
gives guidance for the design of model CTE programs in their plan for Career Technical Education, which was adopted by the St
ate Board of Education in 
2008. 
 
 
The same quality program indicators were taken into consideratio
n during the development of career pathway programs of study for LMUSD. Specifically, 
the focus of pathway preparation has been on assessing current programs and facilities, establishing relationships with indus
try members and assembling 
advisory committee
s for new programs, reviewing and developing curriculum, reviewing instructor training needs, determining outreach/communicat
ion 
needs, and researching funding options for new and existing pathway programs. 
 
 
The Director of CTE provides direct support to 
instructors, pathway programs, and site administration in the areas of curriculum, facility and equipment, 
postsecondary alignment, industry partnerships, and overall pathway focus. CTE teachers participate in professional developme
nt to stay up to date wi
th 
changes in industry by attending workshops, conferences, and other training opportunities. Additionally, CTE instructors focu
s on pathway development 
and philosophy, which include California State CTE Frameworks and model standards, as well as funding l
egislation that affects the structural make up of 
CTE programs. This baseline of CTE supports has continued to improve annually in the support of current programs that are fun
ctioning well, retooling 
programs that have minor areas of weakness, building out
 
viable pathways from programs that currently function as a single course, and establish new 
programs where programs do not exist but there is a regional workforce need. 
 
 
Several CTE programs participate in Career Technical Student Organization (CTSO) act
ivities and competitions through the Future Farmers of America 
(FFA), SkillsUSA, and HOSA. The Culinary Arts, Agriculture, Design, Visual, Media Arts, and Animation programs have all had r
egional contest student 
winners, who competed in the various categor
ies at the state level. Industry recognized certifications include CPR, First Aid, Food Handlers, Serv Safe, 
Adobe, and CAD. Students also have the opportunity to earn college credit toward a degree within their field of study and som
e pathways offering 
mu
ltiple college courses. Additionally, students are able to build resumes and portfolios with unique projects that demonstrate
 
their level of expertise 
with industry desired skills. Through continually expanding internship programs available in various path
ways, students are able to gain real world 
experience within their field of study that often times leads to employment.
