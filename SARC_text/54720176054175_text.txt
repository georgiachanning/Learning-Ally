Opportunities
 
for
 
Parental
 
Involvement
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
Through
 
training
 
in
 
a
 
program
 
called
 
Parents
 
Investing
 
in
 
Quality
 
Education
 
(PIQE)
 
many
 
of
 
our
 
parents
 
have
 
had
 
an
 
opportunity
 
to
 
become
 
more
 
familiar
 
with
 
the
 
inner
 
workings
 
of
 
a
 
school.
  
They
 
have
 
learned
 
to
 
be
 
more
 
effectively
 
involved
 
in
 
their
 
childrens'
 
education.
  
Parents
 
are
 
active
 
in
 
an
 
organization
 
called
 
the
 
Oak
 
Valley
 
Parent
 
Club,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
serving
 
on
 
the
 
School
 
Site
 
Council
 
and
 
ELAC.
 
Parents
 
actively
 
participate
 
in
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
the
 
LCAP
 
through
 
various
 
outlets
 
such
 
as
 
Talk
 
Sup
 
(monthly
 
lunch
 
with
 
the
 
Superintendent),
 
School
 
Site
 
Council,
 
ELAC,
 
and
 
Principal
 
and
 
Pastries.
 
The
 
School
 
Site
 
Council
 
approves
 
the
 
LCAP
 
annually.
 
In
 
addition,
  
parents
 
are
 
encouraged
 
to
 
volunteer
 
in
 
the
 
classroom.
 
Our
 
Parent
 
Liaison
 
works
 
diligently
 
to
 
increase
 
parent
 
engagement
 
and
 
make
 
connections
 
with
 
families
 
so
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
encouraged
 
to
 
become
 
more
 
involved.

conducted
 
by
 
our

to

Monthly

are
 
conducted

so
 
that

in
 
the
