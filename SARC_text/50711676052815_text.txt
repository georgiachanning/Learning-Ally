By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School 
Facility Conditions 
--
 
General Information
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of 
Public School Construction. The results of 
this survey are included within this report. The results of this survey are available at the district office and on the inter
net 
at mcs4kids.com.
 
 
Rose Avenue provides staff supervision of students twenty minutes 
prior to the start of the school day on the main 
playground and in the cafeteria. We also have a championship winning Traffic Patrol supervising major crosswalks near 
the school in the morning and after school. We require all visitors to the school to sign
 
in at the office and wear visible 
visitor badges while on campus. We lock all gates restricting access to the school. All staff members are instructed to 
question any adults on campus not wearing a visitor badge and to send them to the office to sign in i
f they have not already 
done so. The principal, campus assistant and head custodian patrol the school grounds periodically to ensure student 
safety and to address any safety concerns.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and t
he efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School/Buildings:
 
This school has classrooms, a cafeteria, library, and an administration office. The main campus was built in 1963 and 
op
ened in 1963.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair:
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service. Emergency r
epairs are given the 
highest priority. The school facility is in overall good repair.

Cleaning Process and Schedule:
 
The Operations Department has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards 
are available at 
the school office, or at the Maintenance & Operations office. The Operations Department works 
continuously with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance:
 
The District participated in the Sta
te School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provided flexible state matching funds 
to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school facilities components. State 
contributions to this Program ended in the 201
2
-
13 school year. Deferred Maintenance typically includes paving, roofing, 
plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting and floor systems. Carry
-
over funds for 
deferred maintenance projects throughout the District 
in Funds 01 and 14 have been exhausted. The Board has authorized 
the General Fund to annually contribute $2 million to Facility Maintenance to be used for new construction and 
maintenance projects throughout the District, $2 million to Deferred Maintenance
 
for maintenance projects throughout 

against all other District site repairs and the most urgent repairs are addressed first..
 
 
Data provided by LEA. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by speaking

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achi
evement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entranc
e to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Rose Avenue School Safety Plan is revised and reviewed yearly. The new plan was approved by the Safety Committee 
in September 2019. This year the school staff worked to ensure our plan is in line with district procedures and included all 
aspects of sch
ool safety such as: school lock down procedures, earthquake procedures, information regarding the release 
of students after a crisis, an evacuation plan, and efficient checklists to be used during and after a crisis. Regular drills
 
are 
held giving the staf
f and students the opportunity to practice emergency procedures.  At the beginning of the 2019
-
2020 
school year, we implemented a single point entry for all visitors to the campus.  All gates remained closed and locked 
during school hours and the only poin
t of entry is through the office.  We have also implemented the RAPTOR Visitor 
check
-
in system to ensure a secure campus at all times.

Professional development in MCS is data driven using research
-
based best practices to ensure our students receive 
guaranteed and viable curriculum in every grade, in every 
school.    We use formative and summative data to drive our 
instructional decisions and focus for professional development.  To this end, we utilize multiple structures  to provide 
high
-
quality professional development to our staff including:  summer train
ing, preservice
-
days, district wide professional 
development days, after school workshops, Saturday workshops, substitute
-
release days, instructional coaching, a BTSA 
and PAR program,  and most recently a 0.5% compensation package for those who choose to c
omplete an extra 6 hours 
of professional development.
 
 
MCS has prioritized our focus on mathematics, literacy across grades and content areas, collaboration, welcoming 
schools/customer service, and building our capacity as professionals.  This has been in 
addition to the needed training in 
new adoptions, curriculum and standard updates and the like.  The professional development is sustained through site 
administration, district and site level instructional coaches, and intervention specialists.  In the 201
9
-
202 academic year, 
a new division was also created in order to increase the quality and quantity of professional development provided to 
classified, certificated, and managers alike.
