By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The District takes great effort to e
nsure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the District 
uses the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction.
 
The results of this survey are avai
lable at the District Office. Below is more specific information on the condition of the 
school and the efforts made to ensure that students are provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School Buildings
 
Shasta School was 
completed in 1966, including the administration offices and five classroom buildings. The campus was 
modernized in 2015/2016. The project is completed, the campus now includes 33 permanent classrooms, 10 portable 
classrooms, an administration building, a m
ultipurpose room and library.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep schools in good working order are completed in a timely 
manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and emergency r
epairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 

is available at the school office and at the District Office. 
Staff works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Program
 
The District allocates funding for deferred maintenance. The Deferred Maintenance Program includes funding for 
replace
ment of existing school building components so that the educational process may safely continue. Typically, this 

2019
-
2020 budget a
llocated $640,000 to address deferred maintenance needs throughout the district.
 
 
Modernization Projects
 

plan. As part of that activity 
there are projects planned at Shasta which will be completed through the use of local funds. 
State funding application for those portions of projects which may be eligible for modernization funding have been 
submitted. The modernization of the existing sit
e was completed in 2017.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
