By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Bridges Math program that focuses on concepts, skills and numerical fluency hig
hlighted in the common core 
mathematical practices.  El Granada utilizes a high level use of computers and technology in all content areas, and has 40
-
year tradition of celebrating Arts and Science Week. El Granada has an extended day Kindergarten enrichme
nt program 
beginning each December that engages students in thematic units and project based learning.  The El Granada parent 
community is highly involved as evidenced by the PTO's commitment and support of enrichment programs and school

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
El Granada Elementary 
School actively seeks and welcomes parent and community involvement. The school climate is 
developed through a cooperative effort of the school staff, Parent
-
Teacher Organization (PTO), School Site Council (SSC), 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), 
and parent volunteers.
 
 
Parents are involved in many different capacities. The parent community at El Granada Elementary School participates 

rovide 
transportation for educational field trips, raise funds for enrichment programs, supply educational materials, provide 
technical assistance, serve on committees, and take various leadership roles. In fact, the PTO raises about $90,000 per 
year and c
ontributes significantly to educational enrichment activities on campus.
 
 
At the start of the 2018
-
19 school year El Granada formed a Parent Engagement Team. This group of parents, teachers, 
staff members and principal work to develop literacy events to 
engage parents in ways to help their children at home with 
their reading. To enhance our Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support framework we have initiated regular meetings 
with families to discuss school safety and climate. In order to maximize par
ental involvement, there is an on
-
site bilingual

School Safety 
Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
El Granada Elementary School published a comprehensive school safety plan in the 2018
-
19 school year. This 
comprehensive plan will be updated annually by the Safety Team and school staff and is approved annually by the School 
S
ite Council.  The plan includes the following sections:  assessment of current status, action plans for ongoing review and 
update of programs and safety protocols, and strategies and programs for student and staff and school safety.  The key 
elements in th
e safety plan include emergency procedures for a wide variety of events, important phone numbers, and 
roles and responsibilities of the staff. Our school safety plan includes training from the Coalition for Safe Schools and 
Communities, San Mateo County in
 
"The Big Five"  which provides comprehensive school emergency guidelines and 
immediate action response procedures.  The school has an emergency alert radio; this system is tested weekly.  El Granada 
has emergency medical supplies such as Epipens and an au
tomated external defibrillator (AED), on site for emergency 
use.  All staff are trained on basic emergency protocols (choking, allergic reactions, the use of the AED and other basic 
emergency situations).  Staff is offered CPR, cardiopulmonary resuscitatio
n, training annually. All visitors are required to 
check in at the office.  All Staff wear ID badges.
 
 
Interpersonal skills are addressed through comprehensive classroom management systems that focus on respect for 
selves, others and property.  Second Step
 
anti
-
bully curriculum is being implemented across all grade levels.  El Granada 
Elementary School continues to develop and implement a framework for School Wide Positive Behavioral Interventions 
and Supports (SW
-
PBIS):  A systemic approach to proactive sc
hool wide behavior. Expansion of the District's School Link 
Services program is providing additional social and emotional health supports for students and families and social and 
emotional learning training for teachers.  This is based on the three branch 
model of social and emotional learning: 
prevention, intervention and education.  These efforts ensure that El Granada maintains a safe, respectful, compassionate 
school climate to meet the varying social, emotional and academic needs of our students.

At El Granada Elementary teachers work in collaborative grade level groups and across grade level groups to develop units 
of study in Reading, Writing, Math and ELD.  This provides our students with a coherent, consistent academic program 
throughout their 
attendance at El Granada.  Teachers also examine student work to determine learning goals, develop 
units of study, and analyze effective teaching practice. This collaborative approach to teaching and learning also ensures 
that students' full range of acade
mic, social and emotional needs are met.
 
 
El Granada's Leadership Team's primary focus areas are student achievement, curriculum, instruction, school climate and 
developing teacher leadership.  This team sets our collaboration calendar, determines area of 
need with respect to 
professional development, and schedules supplemental professional development opportunities for teachers and staff.  
The professional development plan, collaboration calendar, and supplemental training are based on the site specific, j
ob 
embedded needs of our staff.  El Granada has implemented several different structures to provide teachers with 
opportunities to collaborate and learn from one another.  This includes yearly data conferences, innovative workshops 
exploring effective stra
tegies for building resilience in children to meet their social
-
emotional needs and peer visitations. 
The El Granada staff partners with their elementary colleagues at other sites to articulate the implementation of Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS).
 
 
El Granada's School Site Council provides opportunities for teachers to engage in professional development to enhance 
their individual needs and interests in the areas of literacy and math.
 
 
Early Release Days for Collaboration and Professional Developmen
t:
 
Cabrillo Unified School District has dedicated a block of time every week for an afternoon of teacher collaboration. At El 
Granada Elementary School every Tuesday is an early release day. Students are dismissed at 1:15 p.m. Teachers meet in 
grade level 
groups around topics determined by the Leadership Team.  Topics could include unit planning, examination of 
student work, or examination of teacher practice and strategies. Teachers may also engage activities such as goal setting 
for student learning, revi
ewing student work and assessment results using protocols, and aligning best teaching practices 
to support our curricular programs. This is an invaluable part of our professional development as reflective adult learners. 
Collaboration time is built into th
e teacher work day, which helps drive our instruction and meet student needs.
