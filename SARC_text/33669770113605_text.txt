School Description
 
Built in 2007, Lake Hills Elementary is now in its thirteenth year of operation.  With a current 
population of approximately 710 students (transitional
-
kindergarten through grade five) we serve 
a diverse ethnic and socioeconomic group of
 
individuals.  54% of our students are Hispanic, 24% 
White, 5% African American, and 13% Asian.  Approximately 7% of our students are English Learners 
and 45% are socioeconomically disadvantaged.
 
 
At Lake Hills it has been our priority to establish a cultu
re and climate that provides a physically and 
emotionally safe learning environment, promotes strong family involvement, fosters collaboration 
among all individuals (teachers, students, staff, parents, and community), provides a rigorous 
academic curriculu
m and embraces a commitment to creating a school that knows no limits to the 
academic success of each student. The result is a belief system that permeates our school and 
community that all students will learn at Lake Hills.
 
 
As one enters our campus, it i
s evident that this is a community of learners. We are proud to have 
fostered our AVID Elementary program, where each classroom is represented by a college or 
university. We are family at Lake Hills, and the culture and climate set the stage for students t
o 
reach their highest academic and social potential. Throughout the campus you will see a 
collaborative team of students, staff, and parents who greet each individual student and family, 
often by name, as they arrive to start their day.  Our number one pri
ority is to ensure that our 
students leave our school at or above grade level standards in English Language Arts and 
Mathematics, and that they are socially and emotionally prepared to participate in their next level 
of education. Our community exudes C.L.
A.S.S. (character, leadership, attitude, scholarship, and 
service) in everything that we do!
 
 
Lake Hills has worked hard to establish and sustain the exceptional systems that are now in place 
on our campus. Having received the Distinguished School honor in
 
2010, 2018 and 2020, the sense 
of pride our community demonstrates towards our school culture has grown, and the recognition 
served as validation of our practices, renewing our commitment to serve all students to the best of 
our abilities.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of 
each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formul
a (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local 
priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the 
school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Lake Hills Elementary School, built in 2007, is located on 13.0 acreage and its 
square footage totals 61,573.  The school has 35 permanent classrooms, 
five sets of restrooms, two computer labs, one administration office, four center pods, one conference room, one library, one
 
multipurpose room, one 
outdoor stage, one teacher's lounge 
and 16 work rooms.  On

going campus improvements and maintenance ensure facilities are up to date and provide 
adequate space for students and staff.
 
 
Alvord Unified School District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functio
nal.  To assist in this effort, the district uses a facility 
survey instrument developed by the State of California OPSC.  Results of this survey are available in the school office or at
 
the district.  In addition, district 
maintenance staff makes repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order. A district
-
wide work order process is used to ensure 
efficient service and to prioritize repairs.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessmen
ts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the
