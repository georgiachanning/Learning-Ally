al programs 
we offer to our students. Excelsior School is very proud to have 
earned the distinction of being a California Gold Ribbon School. 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2018
-
19)
 
All core curriculum materials have been reviewed for alignment with the California Content Standa
rds (Common Core State Standards) and Next 
Generation Science Standards, adopted by the State Board of Education (SBE).  These materials have been evaluated, piloted, a
nd selected by a 
committee of teachers, and subsequently adopted by our governing board.
  
All students receive the appropriate and necessary curriculum and 
supplementary materials.  Permanent books are loaned to students each year and collected at the end of the year.  Consumable 
materials are provided 
to each and every student to support cla
ssroom instruction.  For digital curriculum components, students without devices are allowed to loan a device 
for access at home.
 
 
Teachers may, according to need, augment these materials with activities, materials, web
-
based resources and utilize instruct
ional strategies they have 
learned in workshops or curriculum classes.

that helps design, organize, and plan activities such as the Harvest Festival, Holiday Events, School Dances, etc.  Through t
he SSC, (School Site Council), 
continuous needs assessments are conducted, and School Site Plans are designed, d
iscussed and approved.  Excelsior Elementary School sends parent 
representatives to district committees and initiatives, such as EUSD's GATE (Gifted and Talented Education) program, DELAC (D
istrict English Learner 
Advisory Committee) and for this year in t
he spring, EUSD's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Advisory Group.  EUSD involves parents in task forces regularly 
when decisions impacting the classrooms and hence student education are involved.  Parents have participated in the updating 
of the district'
s board 
policy on homework, for example.
 
 
Excelsior Elementary School engage targeted and consistent efforts to seek input and involvement of parents of designated gro
ups that are typically 
underrepresented, e.g. English Language learners, Students with Di
sabilities, and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged students. This is accomplished 
through various ways: emails, newsletters, websites, and phone calls.  Additionally, through the district, Parent Educator Wo
rkshops are offered on such 
important topics as Effe
cts of Technology on the Brain, Raising Happy and Resilient Students, and e
-
Cigarettes, the Vaping Scourge.  This year, the district 
has offered parent workshops on Common Core Math, Next Generation Science Standards, and School Safety.

Eureka Union School District certificated and classified staff members participate in various professional 
development opportunities aligned with district 
goals, as specified in its LCAP (Local Control Accountability Plan). These goals were developed upon stakeholder input and an
alysis of various student 
outcome measures, primarily CAASPP (California Assessment
 
of Academic Student Performance and Progress). For the last 3 years, all certificated staff 
members participated in at least three district
-
wide professional development days per year focused on the implementation of the California Content 
Standards (ELA 
and Math), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and research
-
proven instructional strategies. Throughout the year, various 
afternoon workshops were also provided to address different topic areas: Differentiation, Universal Design for Learning, Visu
al L
iteracy, Vocabulary 
Instruction and others.  EUSD has also promoted a balance of growth opportunities in all MTSS domains 
-
 
academic, socioemotional, and behavioral.  This 
year, the district focused on practices that promote diversity awareness and appreci
ation, equity, and inclusion.
 
 
Summer institutes also provide teachers opportunities to extend knowledge and skills, plan and collaborate. During the summer
 
of 2019, K
-
8 teachers 
were provided training on NGSS, new History & Social Studies Frameworks, STEM,
 
using technology in the classroom, socio
-
emotional development, etc. 
Additionally, during the year, teachers participated in several regional and state conferences.

Types of Services Funded
 
Eureka Union School District is guided by its mission of "Working Together for Excellence 
-
 
Every Student, Every School, Every Day" and hence, its budget 
in 
focused on supporting high
-
quality instruction in the classroom.  The classroom is protected from funding cuts as much as possible to maintain EUSDs 
high academic performance. In a study conducted, the Eureka Union School District was found to have the hig
hest percentage of budget dollars 
concentrated in the classroom (teachers, aides, materials, equipment) relative to other districts in the region.  EUSD also b
elieves in the education of the 
whole child, and its budget reflects this commitment.  Several pr
ograms exist to support and promote socioemotional development and positive 
behavioral outcomes.  EUSD has the highest counselor to student ratio in the region.
 
 
For struggling and at
-
risk students, academic intervention support is available at all sites. 
 
Students and teaching staff also have access to technology to 
help make teaching and learning more effective.  There are instructional aides available for  providing direct support, wheth
er push
-
in or pull
-
out, to 
struggling students.  The district coordi
nates and provides support to programs that serve students representing different populations: SpEd, GATE, and 
EL. Each school site provides unique programs and resources based on identified needs.

DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/

and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regardin
g English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
