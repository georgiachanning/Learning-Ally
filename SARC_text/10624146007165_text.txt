By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Lincoln Mission Statement
 
Our Mission at Lincoln Elementary Sc
hool is to hold high expectations for student success by providing our students with 
an educational setting in which all students can learn. The dignity and individual differences of every student will be 
recognized. Students will be encouraged to develop 
to their fullest intellectual, social, physical and emotional potential to 
attain the skills necessary to become productive life
-
long learners and contributing citizens of society.
 
 
Lincoln Vision Statement
 
Mighty RAMS will collaborate throughout grades ma
intaining high expectations and engaging students to ensure all 
challenges turn into possibilities.
 
 
Lincoln Elementary is one of fourteen elementary schools in the Sanger Unified School District. The school serves 
approximately 461 Transitional Kindergart
en through sixth grade students. One hundred percent of these students 
participate in the Free or Reduced
-
Priced Lunch Program. Approximately 40% of the students are considered English 
Learners.  We have 91% socioeconomically disadvantaged student populati
on.  The percentage of Hispanic or Latino 
students is 93.6%, American Indian or Alaskan Native students is .4%, Asian/Pacific Islander students is 1.5%, Black 
students is .8%, and White students is 3.7%. Students with special needs which include Migrant 2%
, students with 
disabilities 19.7%, and homeless 4.5%.
 
 
The entire School Based Coordinated Program is coordinated between our supplemental Title 1, Title II, Title III, and LCFF 
budgets, and is monitored by the principal, SSC/ELAC, and Leadership PLC (rep
resentatives from grade level and support 
services at Lincoln). The principal regularly monitors and coordinates budgets, programs, and implementation in the areas 
of the instructional program, academic support, professional development and parent and comm
unity involvement. This 
assures that all of Lincoln School's students are able to receive additional services to help them experience success in the 
core program. To guarantee student participation in all coordinated programs, the principal oversees a plan
 
to involve 
staff and community in an effort to increase student attendance.
 
 
The Lincoln principal communicates with parents regularly through a weekly newsletter and calendar, important dates on 
the marquee, weekly informational packet, parent 
meetings, phone messages using a phone
-
dialer system, School Site 
Council/ ELAC, and the quarterly Parent/Administrator Meetings to inform them of up
-
coming opportunities to participate 
in decision
-
making at the school. School functions are advertised in b
oth English and Spanish, and parents are reminded 
of training, parent
-
teacher conferences, and volunteer activities. Translated notices are provided for parents of EL 
students, and interpreters are made available for school functions. One percent of catego
rical funds are used for increasing 
and supporting existing parent involvement.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Sanger Unified retains an independent contractor to provide comprehensive facilities inspection of every school site. This 
inspection meets or exceeds the criteria of the State of Cal
ifornia Williams inspection requirement. The Williams 
compliance inspections are done by Fresno County Office of Education (FCOE). Only one SUSD site is inspected by Fresno 
County Office of Education annually for Williams compliance. This site is not a FCO
E inspected site. The most recent 
inspection, either district or Williams, available when this SARC is prepared is utilized for this report. Inspection reports
 
are maintained at the SUSD District Office.
 
 
The rating scale used for this inspection is as fol
lows:
 
 
99% 
-
 
100% = Exemplary: School meets most/all standards of good repair. Noted deficiencies, if any, are not significant.
 
 
90% 
-
 
98.99% = Good: School maintained in good repair with some isolated deficiencies from wear/tear or are being 
mitigated.
 
 
75% 
-
 
89.99% = Fair: School is not in good repair with some critical or widespread deficiencies and repairs are necessary.
 
 
00% 
-
 
74.99% = Poor: School facilities are in poor condition with deficiencies of various degrees throughout and major 
r
epairs are necessary.
 
 
The results of the most recent report available for this campus are disaggregated below.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The Lincoln PTO works to support school wide and individual classroom activities.  This has often taken the form of support 
for Red Ribbon Week, kindness week, a School Carnival, Family Fun Nights, jog a ton, and other fundraising opportunities 
that parent
s can participate and help our school site, and various holiday activities.  We welcome volunteers as general 
help in the office or for specific service in a classroom.  Volunteers can help inside the classroom with reading and math 
groups.  Parents may vo
lunteer to not only help in the class, but they may also help with supervision for playgrounds and 
or assists with any school function. Anyone wishing to become a member of our PTO may obtain an application at our 
Office.  We also have parents serving in e
lective positions on our School Site Council (SSC) and our English Language 
Advisory Committee (ELAC) which directs our use of School Improvement (SI) funds and gives input on programs and 
services for our English Learners.  Meetings are held throughout th
e year and all meetings are open to the public.  Parents 
are given the opportunity to participate in programs by learning to help their students with homework and study skills, 
parenting skills, how to help their students with academics, and acquisition of
 
the English Language. We have also 
partnered up with the Sanger Family Resource Center to have quarterly meeting on topics such as diabetes, homework 
help, cancer, nutrition, productive parent conferences, accessing the school system and any other topics 
that the parents 
request.  We have also started English As a Second Language classes that are held 2 nights a week via Sanger Adult School.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school site has a Safe School Plan that is reviewed and updated annually in the month of August for staff and for 
parents in October/November.  Plans are reviewed with staff annually 
often at the beginning of each School Year.  Staff 
goes over fire and lock down drills, sexual harassment training, blood borne pathogens training, mandated reporting, and 
various school procedures for day to day safety.  Lincoln's School Site Council (SSC
) approves our Safe School Plan.  
Emergency drills are conducted to prepare students and staff in the event of an emergency.  We perform monthly drills.  
We strive to maintain a safe, healthful, nurturing and orderly school campus that encourages positive 
attitudes in students 
and staff.  We are a closed campus meaning all major entry point gates are close but still accessible with door knobs or 
handles and are unlocked.  The gates are closed due to ability of students with disabilities that may elope.  We 
work closely 
with our district repairmen, grounds keepers, and Sanger PD to assists with monitoring gates are closed during and after 
conducting business in or around campus.  A joint effort between students and staff help keep the campus clean and litter 
free. Our Sanger Fire department also does yearly inspections of the site to ensure our classrooms are free from hazards.  
Site maintenance staffs survey the campus as the first order of business each day.  They ensure the campus is clean, any 
vandalism is
 
corrected, and that the campus is presentable and representative of the priority Sanger School Board sets on 
safety and appearance.  Oversight of Sanger Unified Safe School Plans is through the Welfare and Attendance Officer.  This 
site's Safe School Plan
 
was reviewed with site staff and parents on October 21st, 2019.  The binder may be seen and is 
located in the main office.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuou
s Improvement

What are the primary/major areas of focus for staff development and specifically how were they selected? For example, 
were student achievement data used to determine the need for professional development in reading instruction?
 
 
All of
 
our professional development is based on the needs of our students and teachers, assessed through observations, 
surveys, disaggregation of SBAC data, PBIS data and other assessment data. Teachers in Sanger Unified have completed 
professional training cour
ses designed to support educational priorities and objectives. Staff Development Days are 
designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for administrators, teachers and classified personnel.
 
 
What are the methods by which professional development i
s delivered (e.g., after school workshops, conference 
attendance, individual mentoring, etc.)?
 
 
As a district, we are committed to offering teachers a variety of professional learning opportunities and options for 
personalized professional development. San
ger Unified provides professional learning in all subjects (Math, STEAM, ELA, 
ELD, assessments etc.) for TK
-
6th grade teachers throughout the school year. For single
-
subject teachers, Sanger Unified 
provides two to four full days of training dedicated to s
pecific initiatives, strategies and frameworks (Balanced Literacy, 
Guaranteed and Viable Instruction, ELD, Writing, Speaking and Listening, Close Reading, Project Based Learning, Universal 
Design for Learning, etc.) Sanger Unified also offers after
-
school 
workshops on various math instructional strategies and 
routines, after
-
school technology trainings and Universal Design for Learning trainings. Each year, we offer a district 
conference where teachers share their best practices with one another. Teacher le
aders at all sites are given a variety of 
opportunities to attend national and state conferences and seminars, as to further the collective knowledge of all 
members of their grade level teams and learning communities. Teachers also have the opportunity to 
engage in 
personalized professional development through instructional coaching.

New to the profession Teachers are also supported through the Sanger Unified School District Beginning Teacher Support 
and Assessment Induction Program (BTSA) and New Teacher 
Support. A teacher that is teaching under a PIP or STSP, or is 
an Intern is assigned a mentor that provides the new teacher with a minimum of 4 hours per week of direct or indirect 
support for his/her individualized professional growth. In addition, the te
achers attend required professional development 
provided by the district and school site. New teachers that have a preliminary credential participate in our formal BTSA 
Induction Program. Teachers participating in BTSA receive support from a trained suppor
t provider for two years. The

teachers, along with their mentors (support providers) attend 4 Network meetings together over the 2 years. In addition, 
the program may offer additional professional development offerings based on participant request and through surveys 
that includ
e the following: Classroom Management, Conducting Parent Teacher Conferences/Parent communication, 
Meeting the needs of special needs students, Technology, Writing, etc. Sanger Unified's BTSA Induction Program provides 
support and assessment opportunities 
for all first and second year Participating Teachers to increase understanding of 
their own professional development, which will enable them to more effectively meet the diverse learning needs of their 
students. The mentors, called support providers, are t
rained in cognitive coaching, working with adult learners, and FACT. 
Support Providers attend a two
-
day training their first year and a one day Refresher every year after. In addition SPs are 
required to attend an orientation, and 2 after school trainings 
each year to work on their mentoring skills.
 
 
How are teachers supported during implementation (e.g., through in
-
class coaching, teacher
-
principal meetings, student 
performance data reporting, etc.)? With so many district initiatives, it is essential to ha
ve support for all teachers and 
administrators during implementation. Through many of our contracted trainings (Balanced Literacy, NGSS, UDL), our 
expert trainers provide on
-
site support and follow up personalized coaching. There are varied levels of suppo
rt, both at 
the site and district level. At school sites, teachers are supported during implementation by their grade
-
level or content 
colleagues through Professional Learning Communities. In addition, Curriculum Support Providers, Literacy Specialist 
Teac
hers, (Teachers on Special Assignment) and administrators provide on site support. District support is provided at the 
PLC level through collaborative unit/lesson planning and facilitated curriculum curating experiences.
 
 
All of our professional developmen
t is based on our students and teachers needs. Teachers in Sanger Unified have 
completed professional training courses designed to support educational priorities and objectives. Staff Development 
Days are designed to provide continuous learning opportuniti
es for administrators, teachers and classified personnel.
 
 
Unified uses Staff Development Days and support from site level Curriculum Support Providers and district level District 
Instructional Specialists to assist teachers in classroom 
instructional strategies. The district provided a strong base for 
Common Core English Language Arts Implementation over the last few years through professional development focused 
on academic vocabulary, content reading and writing, and unpacking standards
. This year the district will provide an 
extensive Math training on the mathematical practices, math tasks, and academic discourse. Further English Language 
Arts professional development will focus on writing mini lessons and units.
 
 
New to the profession 
Teachers are also supported through the Sanger Unified School District Beginning Teacher Support 
and Assessment Induction Program (BTSA). Teachers participating in BTSA receive support from a trained support provider 
for two years. The Sanger BTSA program 
uses the Formative Assessment for California Teachers (FACT) formative 
assessment to guide "new" teachers in their professional growth. The Sanger BTSA program also provides a menu of 
professional development opportunities for BTSA Participating Teachers, 
Support Providers, and invites all teachers in the 
district to participate, if the topic meets their need. The menu of professional development offerings include the following:
 
Classroom Management, Conducting Parent Teacher Conferences/Parent communicatio
n, Meeting the needs of special 
needs students, Technology, UDL, Writing, etc. Sanger Unified's BTSA Induction Program provides support and assessment 
opportunities for all first and second year Participating Teachers to increase understanding of their own
 
professional 
development, which will enable them to more effectively meet the diverse learning needs of their students.
 
 
In addition to staff development days, teachers participate in workshops and conferences on the following: Literacy 
Strategies, Writin
g, Reading and Literacy Training, and ongoing SBE textbook adoption in
-
services are provided throughout 
the first 2
-
years of a curriculum, text implementation period. In
