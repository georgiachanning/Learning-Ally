Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-

Vision: McKinley Elementary School challenges the leaders, thinkers, and creators of tomorrow.
 
 
Mission: McKinley Elementary School engages our community to build resilient, curious, compassionate, problem
-
solvers 
who are prepared for their future. 
 
 
School Profile:
 
 
McKinley Elementary School is an innovative TK
-
5th grade public school in the Burlin
game School District that serves a 
diverse student population of approximately 565 students. Collaboratively, the McKinley community supports the learning 
in each of our classrooms to challenge the leaders, thinkers, and creators of tomorrow. McKinley offe
rs two high
-
quality 
instructional programs, Structured English Immersion (SEI) and Spanish
-
English Dual Language Immersion (DLI) models. 
Both programs embrace multi
-
tiered systems of support (MTSS) and culturally relevant pedagogy to best serve all 
student
s. 
 
 
In California, MTSS is an integrated, comprehensive framework that focuses on Common Core State Standards, core 
instruction, differentiated learning, student
-
centered learning, individualized student needs, and the alignment of systems 

change through intentional design and redesign of services and supports that quickly identify and match the needs of all 
students. A
s part of MTSS, McKinley uses Response to Instruction & Intervention (RTI²); and Positive Behavioral 
Intervention and Supports (PBIS) to serve the whole child. We are committed to redefining the perception of intervention. 
At McKinley we define interventio
n as personalized learning that encompasses students performing below grade level all 
the way to students who need greater academic challenge. 
 
 
RtI² is an approach that focuses on student growth at all levels for all students and pulls together resources 
from the LEA, 

-
driven with tiered levels of intervention to 
benefit every student. We strive to provide an individualized learning environment that teaches to all levels and meets
 

 
 
PBIS is an approach that focuses on the emotional and behavioral learning of students, which leads to an increase in 
engagement and a decrease in problematic behavior over time.

McKinley is a strong, caring community that outpou
rs time and energy to build resilient, curious, compassionate, problem
-
solvers who are prepared for their future. United, our community elevates opportunities for all students with the belief 
that their problem solving skills will positively affect our glo
bal society and allow our students to successfully respond to 
a rapidly changing world. We are committed to creating a learning environment that utilizes a variety of thoughtful and 
researched
-
based, pedagogical approaches designed to encourage critical re
flection, collegial peer engagement, and 
perspective transformation for our school teaching staff and school leadership team. Culturally relevant pedagogy along 
with the implementation of the MTSS framework has the primary goal of creating a dynamic, activ
e teaching that will 
ultimately support and meet the needs of all the diverse learners at McKinley. We believe this all
-
encompassing teaching 
and learning framework will have a positive impact on student achievement, school culture and school leadership ca
pacity.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Student safety is one of our highest priorities at McKinley School since students learn best when they are in a safe and 
orderly environment. Staff and parent volunteers monitor the school grounds before school, at recesses, and at lunchtime. 
Teachers regu
larly review the guidelines for safe, responsible behavior. We have a fully fenced, closed campus, and visitors 

dismisses all students to
 
their proper guardian and wait with them until they are picked up. We work continually with 
parents to ensure the students are dropped off and picked up in a safe orderly system.
 
 
We revise our School Safety Plan annually; it was last revised in November 
2018. The plan includes procedures for The Big 
Five drills that include secure campus, drop, cover, and hold on, lockdown, evacuation, and shelter in place, as well as 
locations of exit routes. We share the Comprehensive School Safety Plan with all staff d
uring a school wide staff meeting 
at the start of the school year. We practice fire drills monthly and hold trainings for staff on emergency preparedness 
annually.

We believe that ongoing professional development is the 
hallmark of our educational system in Burlingame. Teachers and 
administrators review student achievement data and choose topics relating to the most pressing issues from the previous 
year. Our teachers attend conferences outside the district and workshops 
within the district. Faculty meetings include 
professional development activities, and the staff collaborates on a regular basis. The following professional development 
opportunities were made available to staff.
