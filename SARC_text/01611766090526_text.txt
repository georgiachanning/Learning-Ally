School Description
 
Chadbourne is a school committed to continuing examination of its core mission, to provide a 
rigorous standards
-
based academic program that is balanced by a variety of interventions, as well 
as enrichm
ent activities and programs, which stretch the unique potential of each child.  Our motto, 

continuing tradition of providing excellence and equity for all students t
hrough differentiated 
instruction and continued enhancement of teaching and learning strategies. Chadbourne is also 
incorporating a Character Education program where our specialists work together to create 
enrichment activities that support our standards b
ut also work on building well rounded students.
 
 
Chadbourne is a K
-
6 school with an enrollment of approximately 760.  We celebrate the diversity 
of our student population.  In addition to our regular education classes, we have three Special Day 
Classes (SDC) providing instruction to grades K through six serving our moderate special education 
students.  As well as giving them opportunities to participate in other classes to gain a wide variety 
of exposure to different curriculum and methods of tea
ching.  We have many mainstreaming 
opportunities for our SDC students.  W are always looking at least restrictive environment for all 
our students.
 
 
Our close partnership with our parents and community enhances the quality of teaching and 
learning experien
ces for both students and staff.  Dedicated parents and our parent group, the 
Chadbourne Family and Faculty Association (CFFA) are our greatest supporters.  Through a 
voluntary Pioneer Pledge, we are able to provide music and visual arts instruction from q
ualified 
professionals for all our students that are aligned to the common core state standards. The Pioneer 
Pledge also provides funds for technology upgrades in classrooms and the campus as a whole. 
Students learn music and art appreciation through a par
ent taught and designed Fine Arts Mini 
Experience (FAME).  Our classroom teachers also integrate performance and visual arts with 
language arts, mathematics, science and social science.  We have an active Technology Committee 
made up mostly of parents who 
share their expertise in technology by giving us technical support 
and help in maintaining our network connectivity.  Our classes also enjoy learning life, earth, and 
physical science at Mission Creek.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educatio
nal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, d
ata reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.c
a.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether s
chools have enough books in core classes for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of 
Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our main building is 60 years old. As our enrollment grew, eleven portable buildings were added to our campus. These portable
s house our intermediate 
grade students and speech and psychologist offices.
 
A new multiuse building, remodeled restrooms, additional parking spaces, playground equipment, 
and electrical upgrades were added through modernization projects in 2005. In the summer of 2009 the district replaced our wi
ndows and installed a 
new roof. Dur
ing the summer of 2014 through 2016 the district abated most classrooms for asbestos and replaced old carpets with solid surf
ace flooring. 
In the summer of 2017 our school got IT upgrades that were complete in 2018. Our buildings and grounds are clean and 
well maintained by the district 
and our own custodial staff. We take pride in our beautiful setting and landscaped field.
 
 
We have one day
-
time custodian and two full time night custodian who keep our buildings and grounds clean. Each classroom and all res
trooms are 
cleaned every day. District grounds and maintenance crews maintain landscaping on a regular schedule.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey calle

Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the da

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: P
arental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Op
portunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Our parents are truly our partners in providing students with high
-
quality learning experiences. Every year on the first day of school, the Chadbourne 
Family and Faculty Association (CFFA) recruits
 
volunteers to work as classroom room helpers, field trip drivers, tutors and mentors in the classrooms, as 
coaches for our boys and girls basketball teams, halloween carnival, field day and as Safety Patrol volunteers.
 
 
CFFA asks parents for an annual vol
untary Pioneer Pledge to raise funds to pay for our music and two art consultants. Our students also learn music and 
art appreciation through Fine Arts Mini Education (FAME), which is a totally parent
-
driven program.   The money from the Pioneer Pledge sup
ports 
classrooms and also the school, such as big projects that can support the safety of our students.  Chadbourne students are fo
rtunate to have a year
-
round program of visual and performing arts. We have an active Technology Committee that generously sh
ares its expertise by giving us technical support 
and helps maintain our network connectivity. CFFA pays for many of our new computers and for the replacement and maintenance 
of our existing 
technology equipment and providing our students with assemblies t
hroughout the year, which support different things whether it is academic or social 
emotional education.  CFFA also helps provide assemblies for our campus, such as author visits, Bullying assemblies and a gro
wth mindset assembly.
 
 
We offer our students se
veral after school activities that enrich their academic life. We have an after school band program funded by the Fremont 
Education Foundation. We also have a Robotics Club as a regular part of our after school program. It nurtures the motivation 
and inter
est of future 
engineers and scientists and is a link to lucrative careers in the future. Fee
-
based activities, such as Chess Club, Mad Science and Kidz
-
to
-
pros.  Girl and 
Boy Scout troops, made up mostly of Chadbourne students, are active on our campus and
 
have completed many projects for our school. CFFA coordinates 
traditional celebrations and events, such as our annual Halloween Carnival and cultural events, which highlight our cultural 
diversity and help promote 
better understanding of the different cul
tures and ethnic groups represented on our campus. To find out how you can volunteer, please contact the 
principal at (510) 656

duty supervisors, para educators and parent volunteers supervise students at lunchtime. Teachers and the principal regularly 
review the school 
wide rules for safe, responsible behavior in school, in the classroom, and on 
the playground. We have a closed campus. Visitors must sign in at the office, 
where they receive a visitor sticker to wear throughout their stay for that day at Chadbourne.
 
 
We update our School Safety Plan annually; We work on it as a site team to ensure 
we have the most current procedures in place.  This was last done 
during the months of September 2018 and February 2019 to ensure it was completed in March 2019.  The plan is National Inciden
t Management System 
compliant and includes procedures for emergen
cies, exit routes, and inventories of emergency supplies. We make the plan available on our school 
website and keep copies in the office for parents. We share the plan with all staff during a school wide staff meeting. We pr
actice fire drills monthly and 
e
arthquake drills four times a year. Training for staff on emergency preparedness is held throughout the year.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers 
take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach.  Below is
 
the amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 
3 days
 
2017
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations these days are sometimes reduced.
