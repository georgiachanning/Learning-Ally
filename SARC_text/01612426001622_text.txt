By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

realizes the positive correlation between parent involvement and student success. For this reason, the 
school continually searches for avenues to involve parents and the community to participate in the education of its 
students. The school greatly benefits
 
from its supportive parents who volunteer in individual classrooms and participate 
in family activity nights. Parents are welcome to join the Parent Teacher Community (PTC), take Parent Education Classes, 
and join the School Site Council (SSC) and or Engl
ish Language Advisory Committee (ELAC). Academic Parent Teacher 
Teams meet four nights per year to work on collaboration for student achievement.

20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of 
Searles Elementary School. The school is always in compliance with all 
laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The School Site Safety plan 
was last reviewed and updated in October 2019 by the School Si
te Council/English Language Advisory Committee. All 

steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster
 
drills are conducted on a monthly basis. 
Lockdown drills are held as needed. Students are supervised before and after school by certificated staff, and classified 
staff supervises students during lunch and break periods. There is a designated area for stu
dent drop off and pick up. 
Visitors must sign in at the front of and wear a badge while on campus.
