About th
e SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the 
Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities
 
to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For 
additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All curriculum development at Laguna Beach Unified School D
istrict adheres to the California State Content Standards and Frameworks. Teachers align 
classroom curriculum to ensure that all students either meet or exceed state proficiency levels. Using student data from mult
iple assessments, 
administrators and teach
ers look at how well students are performing according to state grade level standards, identifying areas of strength and 

um Council
 
provides 
guidance and input to ensure the educational program meets the needs of all students. The Curriculum Council, comprised of re
presentatives from 
schools, the District, and parents, oversees curriculum policy and maintains a continuum of instructio
nal programs across all grade levels. All students, 
including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to check out and take home or to access via 
their personal device at home and at school. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the 
District are aligned with the California State Content Standards and Frameworks. The Curriculum Council establishes selection
 
criteria based on state 
sta
ndards, reviews instructional materials on the state list, and makes recommendations to the Board of Education for final appr
oval.
 
 
Laguna Beach Unified School District sets a high priority upon ensuring that sufficient and current textbooks and materials 
are available to support our 

ned that each school 
within the District has sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional mate
rials, or science lab equipment, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. 
the State of California.
 
 
All textbooks are in adequate supply and in excellent to good condition.  The school and district place great emphasis on pro
viding students with the 
most

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of our students and staff is our primary concern. The school has a closed campus;
 
all visitors must sign using the Raptor Visitor Management 
System ensures that accurate and reliable records are kept for every visitor that enters our school, every day. Parents, visi
tors, and volunteers insert their 
California Identification Cards or St
ate issued Driver's Licenses into our system at the front office, instantly screens their backgrounds to ensure the safety 
of all staff and students. Once their background has been verified, they are issued an identification tags to wear while on s
chool gr
ounds. School staff 
and administrators are on duty during recess, lunch, and before and after school to ensure the safety of all our students. Th

preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. F
ire, earthquake, evacuation and lock
-
down drills are conducted 
throughout the school year.
 
 
A Comprehensive School Safety Plan was developed by the district in order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997. The plan pr
ovides students and staff 
a means to 
ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. Key elements of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan include child abuse repo
rting 
procedures; teacher notification of dangerous pupils procedures; disaster response procedures; procedures for safe entering t
o, and exiting from, school; 
sexual harassment policy; suspension and expulsion policies; dress code; and discipline policies. The school evaluates the pl
an annually and updates the 
plan as needed. The plan was reviewed with our school staff and last updat
ed on January 15, 2020, with the School Site Council. El Morro incorporates 
the Positive Behavior and Intervention Support (PBIS) Model, Multi
-
Tiered System of Support and the Character Counts pillars of Caring, Respect, 
Responsibility, Citizenship, Fairne
ss and Trustworthiness to support an atmosphere of inclusion and respect among staff and students.
