By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Professional development is designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for administrators, teachers, and 
classified personnel. Training 
opportunities affirm the basic philosophy of education that learning is a lifelong process that 
contributes to the well
-
being of the students, teachers, administrators, and community. Professional Development is an 
essential component of effective instruct
ion and student learning.
 
 
All training revolves around identified needs of students and adults for the purpose of the improvement of instruction and 
increasing content knowledge. Central to all training are student achievement data, district focus areas, 
the Common Core 
State Standards, the state adopted standards
-
based instructional materials, and strategies to effectively teach the 
academic content standards to all students.
 
 
We also provided extensive professional development for Professional Learning C
ommunities through our Service Delivery 
Model. On
-
site coaching and support is provided by academic coaches and district specialists for reading/language arts, 
mathematics, science, writing and social emotional learning. The district provides time and reso
urces for collaboration, 
planning, and professional development. Additionally, we provided professional development on Multi
-
Tiered Systems of 
Support and Support to school and district teams.
 
 
Teachers new to the District received four days of professiona
l development prior to the beginning of the school year 
focused on orientation to District and school site policies and services, Common Core State Standards, classroom 
management, curriculum and pacing, using technology and setting up the classroom. Teach
ers in their second year with 
the District received two days of professional development prior to the beginning of the school year provided by the school 
site and focused on improving best practices.
 
 
New teachers with California preliminary credentials re
ceived professional development through the Bakersfield City 
School District (BCSD) Teacher Induction Program (TIP). The focus of BCSD TIP is being mentored by an experienced 
teacher, growing in the California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP) a
nd meeting the California Induction 
standards. The culmination of TIP is the recommendation for the CA Clear Credential. Each TIP teacher was assigned a 
veteran teacher who served as a mentor. The mentors received on
-
going professional development in 
coach
ing/mentoring strategies, instructional strategies, and guiding cycles of inquiry. Professional development was 
provided through individual mentoring, monthly meetings, and after
-
school workshops.
 
 
Intern teachers received professional development at month
ly meetings focusing on the initial teaching skills of the CSTP 
including classroom management, lesson planning, assessment, and establishing a climate that is conducive to student 
achievement. Each Intern was assigned a mentor that provided day
-
to
-
day sup
port in these areas as well as advisement 
toward meeting credential requirements. Mentors received monthly professional development in meeting the needs of 
Intern teachers. Interns also received coursework and supervision from universities partnered with B
CSD to provide the 
Intern Program.
 
 
Teachers on Short Term Staffing Permits (STSPs) were provided mentors and monthly trainings on beginning pedagogy 
and best teaching practices. Each teacher on a STSP designed a plan to meet requirements to move to a CA I
ntern or 
Preliminary Credential. Support was provided for required testing and BCSD staff worked closely with university partners 
to ensure teachers on permits were taking prerequisite requirements to move to credentials.
 
 
Teachers on Provisional Intern Pe
rmits (PIPs) were provided a weekly cohort meeting focused on beginning pedagogy. 
Two cohort meetings occurred weekly to allow teachers on a PIP to work around university course schedules. Support was 
provided for required testing and BCSD staff worked clo
sely with university partners to ensure teachers on permits were 
taking prerequisite requirements to move to credentials.
