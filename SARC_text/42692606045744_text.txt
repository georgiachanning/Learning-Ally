To

the

"commits"
 
to
 
maintain
 
high

rich,
 
varied

atmosphere
 
where
 
the

collaborative
 
team
 
and
 
where
 
the
 
leadership
 
is
 
supportive,
 
encouraging
 
and
 
promotes
 
positive
 
changes.
 
We
 
will
 
build
 
a
 
cooperative
 
link
 
between
 
home,
 
school
 
and
 
community,
 
that
 
recognizes
 
and
 
embraces
 
the
 
unique
 
community
 
in
 
which
 
we
 
serve.

The

takes
 
great
 
efforts
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
all
 
schools
 
are
 
 
clean,
 
safe,
 
and
 
functional
 
through
 
proper
 
facilities
 
maintenance

ensure

remain
 
up

conditions
 
that
 
need
 
 
attention
 
prior
