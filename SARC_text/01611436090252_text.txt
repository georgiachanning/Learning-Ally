W
e are proud to present our annual report for the 2019
-
20 school year. We publish this report 
every year to share important facts about our school with the public we serve. It is our goal to 

emic achievements as well as the facts about our 
teachers and support staff who help make learning possible. In this report, you will find information 
about our teachers, students, test scores, resources, and finances. Many qualities contribute to 
making a
 

best to present a wide range of facts, and, when possible, we feature this data alongside data for 
other schools at the same grade level in the district and state. 
We believe that viewing the facts 
about our school compared to other schools in the district and state provides the most insight.
 
 

the education and experienc
e level of our teachers. You will also find estimates of how well 


 
including how much we spend per student compared to other districts like ours in the state
. Open 

responsibility we take seriously. We hope this report will generate a dialogue between members 
of our community and school leadership. We invite you to join us 
in this discussion. To get involved 
at our school, please contact our school office.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SAR
C). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LC
AP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
p
age at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

Williams legislation calls for the schools to have enough books in core classes for all students and
 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are 
presenting information outlined in the California content standards.  Textbook materials are adopted by the school board foll
owing a rotating adoption 
cycle for subject specific state adopted textbooks and 
instructional materials.

School Facility Conditions and Plann
ed Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district administers a scheduled maintenance program to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well maintained and
 
in good repair. A work 
order process alerts district personnel of any maintenance needed to be 
performed and ensures that emergencies are given the highest priority.
 
 
Safety issues are the top priority for Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors inspect school sites cont
inually and complete repairs 
in a timely manner. They use a
 
work order process to ensure an efficient, prioritized repair process. The district maintenance staff has indicated that 
100% of all toilets on school grounds are in working order.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts f
rom our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction.
 
 

 
the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of 
the date of the report. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

to build a strong school community for the betterment of our children and families. A great way that caregivers get involved 
in the school community is 
to regularly attend and/or help at school events
 

classroom and literacy library, chaperoning students on field trips, shelving books in the library, staffing the office, tuto
ring students and brin
ging 
enrichment activities to our classrooms. They are also active members on school governance committees (School Site Council, B

Giving Campaign, the Green Committee, Our School Cares Parent Group,  and a host of other committees. Our active PTA sponsors
 
monthly events, 
including our annual family art night, literacy night, math and science night

School Safety Pl
an
 
Jefferson Elementary School was constructed in 1952 and was comprised of three buildings. In 2014, portions of the main build
ing were remodeled; the 
main office and library were relocated and four additional classrooms were added. Classrooms were create
d on the south end of the auditorium/cafeteria 
building as the district central kitchen was relocated from Jefferson to ML King MS. The main building is an interconnected, 
partial two
-
story reinforced 
concrete building with a partial basement. The campus c
overs nearly three acres and includes 19 permanent classrooms, three staff work rooms, a library, 
one multipurpose room and cafeteria.and one playground,
 
 
The safety of students and staff is our primary concern. A variety of people visit the campus to volu
nteer in the classroom and participate in school 
events. During lunch, recesses, and before
-
and
-
after school, staff members, administrators, and safety officers supervise students and school grounds to 
ensure an orderly, safe environment. The school is alw
ays fully compliant with all rules, laws, and regulations concerning state earthquake standards and 
hazardous materials. Earthquake, fire and lockdown drills are held monthly.
 
 
Safety procedures, including elements of our Comprehensive Safe School 
Plan, are reviewed with school and district staff at the start of each school year. 
The plan was last updated and reviewed with school staff in fall 2019. The staff talks about drills and safety procedures on 
a monthly basis.
