reporting period.







Note: ELA and Mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment and the California Alternate Assessment. The ﬁPercent 
Met or Exceededﬂ is calculated by taking the total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative 

Assessment plus the total number of students who met the standard on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both 

assessments.Double dashes (--) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for 
statistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of 
students tested is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated 
using only students who received scores.California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress
