About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by 
state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are re
quired to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is
 
to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For mo
re information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact th
e school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
General
 
The district takes great efforts to en
sure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the district uses a facility survey instrume
nt 
developed by the Los Angeles County Office of Education. The results of this survey are available at the school office or at 
the
 
district office.
 
 
School Buildings
 
West Wind (originally named Lancaster Elementary) was built in 1990 as a temporary facility. It was renamed when a permanent 
facility was completed 

ices, multipurpose room, cafeteria, staff lounge, and library. There are 33 
classrooms 
-
 
33 permanent.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed i
n a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the distric
t. A summary of these standards is available at the district office. 
The Supervisor of Operations works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe sc
hool.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
Although the State no 
longer requires a Deferred Maintenance contribution, Lancaster School District is still dedicated to maintaining the faciliti
es for 
our students.  These expenditures would include but not be limited to roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electric
al, painting, and flooring.  For 
the 2019
-
20 school year, the district has budgeted $940,000 for deferred maintenance projects.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education popula
tion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
ali
gned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that 
satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Balanced Summative 

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standa
rd (i.e., achieved Level 3

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and eac
h school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parent involvement is highly valued at West Wind Elementary. Parents, guardians, grandparents, aunts, and uncles sign up to v
olunteer in classrooms, 
at our annual Back
-
to
-
School Ni
ght, and in our school office throughout the year. Volunteers represent West Wind on site committees such as ELAC 
(English Learner Advisory Committee) and SSC (School Site Council) meets regularly to address the effectiveness of school pro
grams and curricu
lar 
materials relative to the goals of the school and to address other relevant academic issues making sure the budget is aligned
 
to the goals. Parents 
represent West Wind on DELAC (District English Learner Advisory Committee). They share/network with othe
r schools and the district, bringing back 

h our district 
Superintendent. Again, ideas and activities, as well as concerns, are shar
ed with the Superintendent to help improve school sites. Every semester, the 
principal holds several community meetings inviting parents/guardians to learn and talk about school wide issues and activiti
es.
 
 
West Wind has many school and community activitie
s planned throughout the year. Each month, family members are invited to join their child for lunch 


 
movie nights, book fairs, fund raisers, Fall Festival, the Annual Geography Bee, 
Novem
ber Food Basket Drive, Spring Basket raffles, and three Epic Build Showcases. West Wind could not be as effective as it is wi
thout our wonderful 
and dedicated volunteers.
