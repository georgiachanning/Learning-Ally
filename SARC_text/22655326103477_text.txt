By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Lake Don Pedro Elementary School is a rural school located in the foothills of northwestern Mariposa County. It began as 
a necessary small school but has grown rapidly over the past years to the siz
e it is today. Beginning in the 1990
-
91 school 
year, Lake Don Pedro Elementary became a K
-
8 school. The school serves approximately 170 students. Every classroom 
has a digital whiteboard and digital projector. Our computer lab has 35 laptop computers with 
internet connection. All 
rooms are wired for wireless internet connection. In 5th
-
8th grades we are 1:1 with chromebooks and we utilize Ipads & 
Ipad minis for classroom instruction in K
-
2nd grades. The multipurpose, administration, and kitchen building ope
ned in 
September of 2010. In December of 2010, we were awarded the After School Education and Safety (ASES) Program, with 
a renewal for the 2020 school year. The goals of this program include; To provide academic support and academic 
enrichment to support 
the core program, increase instructional support to EL learners, to promote wellness in each 
student, to educate students in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, and to create a culture of respect 
and student leadership. Approximately 95
 
students benefit from ASES on a daily basis. The educational program focuses 
on the development of reading, writing, spelling, math, history, science, art, and physical education based on the California
 
curriculum standards and frameworks. In January of 2
011, our school implemented an RTI (Response to Intervention) 
model of instruction. Each student in grades K
-
8th grade receives small group instruction in the core curriculum during RTI 
time.
 
 



 
 
The mission of LDPE is to serve as a community and educational resource to h
elp all stake holders grow as individuals and 
lifelong learners. To accomplish our school mission:

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Lake Don Pedro Elementary has developed a comprehensive Emergency and Safety plan. This plan contains information 
on crime assessment, child abuse reporting, disaster preparedness, discipline, teacher notification of a dangerous student, 
sexual harassment,
 
dress code violations, and crisis management teams duties and responsibilities. Each month the school 
holds an emergency drill to prepare our students in the event that a real emergency arises. Much work is being done in 
the area of preventing and reporti
ng bullying behaviors. The plan is updated annually.
