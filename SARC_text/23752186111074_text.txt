By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Whale Gulch Elementary School is a public Necessary Small S
chool, and the hub of its community. Located in the remote 
northern reaches of Mendocino County on the Lost Coast, the school is housed on the same campus as W hale Gulch High 
School. The location provides a unique setting, allowing high school students to
 
act as mentors and partners in cross age 
learning activities, while providing students w it h the needed space, equipment, and teachers for individualized study. 
The school's proximity to state and national forests creates ample opportunity for hands
-
on l
earning, and opportunities 
to partner with public agencies, such as the Bureau of Land Management, and local non
-
profits. W hale Gulch Elementary 
School's commitment to involvement and hands
-
on learning is the cornerstone of its academic excellence.
 
 
The v
ision of Whale Gulch School was created by the community in 1978 when students were informed that their inter
-
district transfers would no longer be granted from Southern Humboldt School District . Parents, refusing to send their 
children two hours away to 
the nearest school in their district , opted to build their own school. Whale Gulch w as originally 
housed in community members' homes, but with the labor of love it grew, one building at a time, into the beautiful campus 
it is today, housing both an eleme
ntary school and a comprehensive high school.
 
 
The mission of LVUSD and Whale Gulch Elementary School is to provide academic excellence in a safe, responsible, and 
respectful environment. Our commitment is to ignite motivation, creativity, self
-
discipline,
 
and a love of learning by 
providing students with the necessary tools which will enable them to become adults who contribute responsibly in the 
global community.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Whale Gulch is very 
unique in that it was created by the parents in the community. This background is the cornerstone to 
continued parent involvement. The opportunities for community involvement within the school are many and varied. The 
following represent opportunities for 
residents to become involved with the district and in the schools. Each year we send 
out a survey asking parents to help with events at school. Parents are encouraged to bring their talents to the students at 
Whale Gulch Elementary School.
 
 
1. Classroom Vo
lunteer: Volunteer help is always encouraged and welcome in the schools. Parent volunteers often seem 
to drop as children advance through the grades, although the need for volunteers continues for all grades. Interested 
parent and community
 
members can con
tact Anthony Loumena, Principal, at 925
-
 
6285 for further information.
 
 
2. Parents in Education: The PIE serves as a primary vehicle for parent/community/staff dialogue. This advisory council 
ensures that the school's LCAP is being implemented and assesses
 
periodically the effectiveness of each program. Parents 
in Education meets
 
quarterly during the school year. Interested residents should contact the acting school principal, Julia George at 986
-
7131.
 
 
3. Leggett Valley Unified School District Board Meetin
gs: School Board meetings are always open to the public w it h 
agendas posted 72 hours in advance for regular Board meetings. Meetings are generally held on the second Thursday of 
each month. Meetings
 
alternate monthly between Whale Gulch and 
Leggett Valley schools. Public input and attendance are encouraged. Contact 
the district office at 925
-
6285 for more information.
 
 
4. District Advisory Committee: This committee is comprised of representatives from throughout the school district . The 
purp
ose of the committee is to advise the school board on the Local Control Accountability Plan. Meetings are held in 
February, March, April and
 
May.
 
 
5. Wellness Committee: Meets on annually to develop and promote district 
-
wide health, nutrition and physical
 
education 
activities. This committee serves as a subcommittee of the District Advisory Committee (DAC).
 
 
6. Activity Nights/Field Trips: Each year there are numerous outreach activities held for students and their parents; these 
include Trade Fair, Winter
 
Program, May Day and the Summer Arts Festival to name a few . These events are enjoyed by 
all who attend. We also
 
have numerous field trips that parents may help chaperone.
 
 
7. Share talents
-
 
Each year parents come into classrooms and teach a small unit o
n something they are passionate about. 
This year we have a parent teaching Yoga and one teaching dance.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
Whale Gulch Schools are not funded through categorical funds. This is due to 
the fact that the free and reduced lunch 
numbers at these sites are not high enough to receive a significant enough amount of money to make claiming them 
beneficial to the school. Whale Gulch is completely funded through general funds. They receive the sam
e services as our 
Leggett Valley schools, which are funded through categorical monies. These include psychological services, health 
technician, counseling, special education teacher, speech services, classroom instructional assistance and yard duty 
supervi
sion.

The principal is the instructional leader at Whale Gulch Elementary School. The district's academic curriculum is aligned 
with the Common Core State 
Standards. Various state publications emphasizing research
-
based strategies are used as 
guidelines for creating curriculum that will help our students be prepared for the future. The Director of Curriculum and 
Instruction, from the Mendocino County Office 
of Education, supports staff on creating and implementing curriculum on 
an as needed basis. The staff regularly collaborates during the twice monthly early release days devoted to discussing 
student progress, assessment, curriculum implementation and extra
-
curricular programs. English Language Arts and Math 
intervention programs are implemented as needed. Because of our small class sizes students are truly given an 
individualized academic program. Technology and small group cooperative group learning is eme
rging as we redefine who 
we are as a school.
 
 
Whale Gulch Elementary School professional development focuses on instructional strategies and best practices that will 
help our students be successful academically. It is also spent updating technology skills 
and practices that will give our 
students the tools they need to compete academically with their peers from other areas. Whale Gulch High has staff 
meetings twice monthly. These staff meetings allow the staff to meet as teams to work on best practices, pla
n curriculum, 
discuss student achievement, revise assessments, discuss school safety and work on other necessary and essential 
components of the school program. The district staff development program continues to encourage teachers to 
participate in variou
s professional development opportunities. Some of these may include:
 
 
1. Participation in professional growth conferences with expenses and substitute costs covered by various funding sources.
 
 
2. Participation in non
-
student Friday staff development. This
 
includes discussions of student progress and developing 
strategies through staff collaboration.
 
 
3. Participation in academic and instructional strategies through county trainings.
 
 
4. Examples of professional development scheduled this year include Googl
e Summit, Restorative Justice Training, Pro
-
Act (behavior management training) and math coaching.
