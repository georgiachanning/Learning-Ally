By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

W
e are excited to announce Lawrence Elementary has been recognized as a Leader in Me school for the second year in a 

framework and practice 
the habits throughout the upcoming school year. Although children must be knowledgeable when 
they graduate, they must also be healthy, engaged, responsible, and caring people. The Leader in Me provides principles 
that address all areas of development. As e
ach child discovers and develops his or her unique gifts and talents, they are 
given opportunities to lead. As leaders, they become active, engaged partners in their own education and their self
-
confidence, responsibility, and initiative grows. The childre
n quickly understand the benefits of different gifts and talents; 
they learn to listen to new ideas, work together to achieve results, and motivate one another to be the best. By teaching 
the principles to our young Labradors, we are creating a generation 
of leaders. 
 
 
It is an honor and privilege to be part of the dedicated and professional staff at Lawrence Elementary. We continue to 

rig
orous and engaging in an atmosphere that is supportive and nurturing. We sustain our instructional program through 

 
a positive and 
profound influence on the lives of our Lawrence Labradors.
 
 
It takes a team to accomplish something meaningful and significant for all. As we experience the 2019
-
2020 school year 
together, please remember my door is always open. If I may be of assistance t

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Our campus consists of 29 classrooms, a science lab, multipurpose room, office, library and makerspace room. Our library/ 
makerspace is a focal point of our school and a place where students interact with the library media specialist to acquire 
library ski
lls and improve their love for reading. Students visit the library once a week. The makerspace is a destination for 
students to be creative. The makerspace is open daily for science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics (STEAM) 
lessons, which compl
ement classroom lessons. Two new playgrounds were added to the site as a Measure J Bond project. 
 
 
The campus is in excellent condition and rooms are cleaned on a daily basis. Repairs are submitted through the LVJUSD 
work
-
order system and are carried out b
y a maintenance/custodial staff. District maintenance staff meet with site 
administration on a regular basis and perform frequent site visits to ensure the school is safe, clean, and in good repair. 
 
 
Visitors are required to check in at the office and wea
r identifying badges. Adults supervise the campus before and after 
school. Supervision is provided on the playground and field at all recesses and in the multipurpose room during lunch. A 
student safety patrol (valet) assists with the safe unloading of stu
dents before school. Our campus is secure, with closed 
and locked gates during school hours. 
 
 
Education is a top priority in the community of Livermore, and maintaining a safe and orderly environment maximizes 
student learning. The citizens of Livermore h
ave passed three major funding measures targeting school facility needs: 
Measure B in 1975, Measure L in 1999 and, most recently in June 2016, the generous and supportive Livermore community 
passed the Measure J Facilities Bond. 
 
 
Measure J funds will be used to: 
 

 
Modernize classrooms, science labs and educational technology for 21st century instruction
 

 
Repair aging infrastructure: roofs, plumbing, HVAC and electrical systems
 

 
Renovate facilities for advanced science, technology, eng
ineering and math (STEM) and Career Technical 
Education (CTE) courses
 

 
Improve safety, including security lighting, fencing, fire safety, and other emergency systems
 

 
Upgrade deteriorated hardscapes, physical education facilities, and pick
-
up/drop
-
off zones
 

 
Increase access to school facilities to better accommodate individuals with disabilities
 
Through these bond measures and developer fees, the LVJUSD has been able to renovate, modernize and construct new 
schools following the Facilities Master Plan. 
 
 
Facil
ities are maintained through the diligent efforts of the site custodial crews and the district maintenance staff. The 
LVJUSD Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the LVJUSD. The principal works with the 
custodial staff to de
velop cleaning schedules to maintain clean and safe schools. District maintenance staff performs the 
repairs necessary to keep the schools in good working order in a timely manner. A work
-
order process is used to ensure 
efficient service and that emergency
 
repairs are given the highest priority.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Livermore Valley Joint Unified 
School District (LVJUSD) values active parent engagement and believes that parent 
involvement is essential to the success of all students. LVJUSD Board Policy 6020(a) states:

irst and most influential teachers and that 
sustained parent involvement in the education of their children contributes greatly to student achievement and a positive 
school environment. The Superintendent or designee shall work with staff and parents/guard
ians to develop meaningful 
opportunities at all grade levels for parents/guardians to be involved in district and school activities; advisory, decision
-

 
 
Educational research suggests 
that highly effective schools have a number of features in common, includ ing high levels 

at high levels and have more well
-
rounded educat
ional experiences. LVJUSD parents are welcome partners in our school 
community. There are a range of opportunities for parents to engage with schools, including Parent Teacher Associations 
(PTAs), Parent Faculty Associations (PFAs), sports and activity boo
ster clubs, and other supporter groups. On a monthly 

Communication and Informa ion Council (PCIC). This gathering provides an opportunity fo
r parent groups to collaborate 
with each other and representatives of the district regarding events, opportunities, and activities for students and families
. 
This is also a time district representatives share new initiatives and current information with pa
rent leaders. In addition, 
parents have the opportunity to share general concerns and ask questions directly to the superintendent. Each school also 
has formal advisory groups including School Site Councils (SSCs) and English Learner Advisory Committees (E
LACs) who 
represent other parents at the site and are critical in the development and monitoring of the 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement (SPSA). A representative from each SSC serves on the district Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) 
Advisory Comm
ittee, and a member of each ELAC serves on the District English Learner Advisory Council (DELAC), which 
also serves as the LCAP English Learner Advisory Committee. Through these two
-
way systems of parent support and 
engagement, parents, district, and schoo
l staff have open lines of communication and opportunities to engage in 
meaningful ways with the school community.
 
 
Lawrence Elementary teachers form strong relationships with their students and are highly effective in connecting them 
to additional support
 
resources. The staff makes parents feel welcomed and respected, responds to concerns, and recruits 
active volunteers. Room parents are identified for classrooms to coordinate parent volunteers and encourage parent 
participation in extracurricular activiti
es. Parents are encouraged to work collaboratively with teachers to establish 
academic expectations for their students during goal
-
setting conferences in the fall. Our parent volunteers work closely 
with teachers to provide targeted academic assistance. Ea
ch week, on Fridays, parents are on the blacktop assisting with 
our Running Club. In addition, parents also support our after
-
school clubs, Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) activities, 
and school 
-
ide events. The Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) raise
s funds to help pay for field trips and various additional 
materials needed to enhance learning in the classrooms. It also sponsors school
-
wide events and assemblies for families 
to attend. The PTO always welcomes parent volunteers. Meetings are on the fou
rth Wednesday of the month in the school 
library at 7 p.m. You may also contact the PTO president, Eileen Weed, at lawrenceptoprez@ gmail.com.
 
 
The Lawrence Labrador Lowdown newsletters, school web
-
page, School Loop (assignments and grades in formation), 
B
lackboard (automated phone call and email system), Lawrence Elementary Facebook page, and Coffee with the Principal 
help keep parents informed and involved in the decision
-
making process at Lawrence Elementary.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Lawrence Elementary, in conjunction with LVJUSD and the Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), provides our students with 
a welcoming campus 
that is clean and in great condition. Staff, students, and parent volunteers pride themselves on the 
inspiration garden, decorative displays of student work, and informational bulletin boards throughout the campus. A visual 
survey of the grounds at Lawrenc
e Elementary shows a sense of community and great deal of pride in our school.
 
 
Lawrence Elementary maintains an ongoing commitment to safety, health, and environmental programs. Our school
-
wide 
rules provide safety for all, and emphasize positive behavior
 
and problem solving in a peaceful and cooperative manner. 
We encourage students to respect each other and always do their best. Recycling is a focus for students and staff at 
Lawrence Elementary. The school safety plan was developed and updated by our Saf
ety Committee and staff. Our campus 
is secure with closed and locked gates during school hours, requiring all visitors to check in the office through our 
computerized badge system. In the event of an evacuation, procedures are in place to allow a quick vis
ual to account for 
all students and staff. We practice fire, earthquake, and lockdown drills regularly following a district schedule.  Using 
Blackboard, we can quickly call several phone numbers and emails simultaneously to alert parents of an emergency. T
he 
school safety plan was last reviewed, updated, and discussed with the school faculty in August 2019.

Our district recognizes that each employee

classified, certificated and management

influences the opportunities for 
students to achieve at the highest levels. In line with our
 
District Professional Development Plan, we offer and support 
ongoing growth opportunities that allow every teacher, administrator, and staff member to further develop the 
appropriate knowledge, skills, and practices required to create learning environment
s that allow all students to 
demonstrate high levels of achievement. Our Board of Education and our district administration recognize that all staff 
members of the LVJUSD must be provided time and support to acquire, improve, and enhance professional knowl
edge, 
practices, and skills.
 
 
During the 2019
-
2020 school year, relevant and timely professional development will be available and delivered to 
employees. In addition, two designated professional development days and the flexible professional development 
day for 
certificated staff provide the option of individualized professional growth for teachers. Professional development will 
primarily focus on effective tier one instruction; Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS), student and staff 
safety
; customer service; meeting the needs of students with Individual Education Plans (IEP); effective usage of 
technology as an instructional tool; effective instructional practices for English learners; and implementation of specialize
d 
programs such as Dual
 
Immersion, Project Lead the Way, International Baccalaureate, and Advanced Placement programs.
