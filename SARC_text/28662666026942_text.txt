By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Irene M Snow School a schoolwide focus on safety, health and well being results in a campus 
that is virtually free of 
violence, drugs and crime. Grounds are kept litter
-
free and supervised by 2 full
-
time custodians (one day and one swing). 
Inspections by the Napa Fire Department address code compliance and ensure that facilities are safe for stud
ents and 
staff. Our PBIS team meets monthly to review the procedures at recess, lunch and transitions to ensure the overall safety 
of students. We review these topics at all parent meetings.
 
Our Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP), modeled on the Incid
ent Command System, addresses all components of 
SB187 including biannual Crime Reports, Student Discipline, Sexual Harassment, Dealing with Dangerous Pupils, Crises 
Response Plan, Dress Code and Alternative Programs. The CSSP is reviewed annually by the Si
te Safety Committee that 
includes staff, parents and representatives of law enforcement. Emergency equipment has been supplied for each 
classroom and for the school as a whole. Evacuation drills are held monthly.
 
During the first weeks of school, teachers 
and the principal explain policies about student safety, playground rules,

We have bi

monthly professional development focusing on AVID, ELA/ELD, Math, GLAD, Next Generation Science 
Standards, Best Teaching practices, PBIS and the Common Core 
Standards. We have used many of our professional 
development hours to focus on Writing, Inquiry, Collaboration, Organization, and Reading Strategies as an AVID school.  
We also have provided grade
-
level time to be trained in GLAD strategies to enrich our E
LD time with students. We are 
focusing on academic discourse and students speaking in complete sentences in each and every lesson.   We have agreed 
as a school to use the Think/Pair/Share strategy multiple times throughout a lesson. We also have spent time
 
each month 
to look at the data surrounding behaviors and we have addressed any concerns through lessons with students and using 
social
-
emotional curriculum. We also implemented weekly announcements that focus on a social skill that teachers use 
as a focus
 
for their classrooms.
