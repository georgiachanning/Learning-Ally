School Description
 
Welcome to Morrison Elementary School. We are a California Distinguished School and a California 
Title I High Achieving School.  Morrison has also been awarded the prestigious Golden Bell Award 
for closing the achievement gap with English
-
Language Learners
 
using English Language 
Development (ELD) and Academic Language Development (ALD).  Our mission is to provide a caring, 
positive, and safe learning environment where each child is encouraged to make safe, responsible, 
and respectful choices, and to develop
 
the academic skills necessary to reach their maximum 
learning potential.
 
 
Students receive a rigorous academic program enriched by participation in the arts, especially 
music. Morrison has significant technology resources, which also support student learn
ing.To 
achieve our vision for students, we support our staff members in the implementation of the 
Common Core State Standards to prepare students for college, career, and life. The standards 
clearly demonstrate what students are expected to learn at each g
rade level, so that every parent 
and teacher can understand and support their learning.
 
 

homework and progress notes, volunteering in the classroom, attending s
chool events and taking 
advantage of all the classes available to parents to further enhance the support given at home. 
Parents can help their children make the most of their education by sending them to school on time 
every day, by making sure that they a
re completing school and homework assignments, and by 
attending parent conferences. We believe that parents are our partners in providing a rigorous, 
quality education for our students. By working together, we can make a bright future for the 
children in o
ur care.

DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the sc
hool to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
In
ternet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional in
formation about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities);

Parent educational classes are provided by PROedu. PROedu's mission is to inform parents and strengthen their skills as paren
ts and leaders so they can 
play an important role in their children's lives.
 
 
The general curriculum 
content consists of three stages:
 
 
a.
 
Responsible Parenthood. Promotes parent's responsibility and commitment to create healthy family relationships.
 
 
b.
 
School Success. Informs parents and raises awareness about their involvement in their children's education.
 
 
c.
 
Responsible Leadership. Motivates/guides parents' leadership
-
advocacy in their family/community.
 
 
Parents are also provided training in the use of Internet programs such as i
-
Ready and Raz
-
KIds.
 
 
We provide opportunities for parents to have input through 
School Site Council, PTA and ELAC.
 
 
Morrison PTA, along with site staff, coordinates and integrates parent involvement activities such as Back
-
to
-
School Night, Open House/Family Picnic 
Day, College Week, Red Ribbon Week, Picture Day, and our 5th Grade Prom
otion Ceremony.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Pla
n
 
In order to increase school safety, we have a campus that is fully fenced. Visitors and volunteers sign
-
in and wear badges during their visit. Many parents 
wait with their students outside the classrooms in the morning and pick them up at the classroom d
oor after school. If parents notice anything 
problematic, they report it immediately to the office. Supervision aides monitor the school grounds for 30 minutes before and
 
after school, at all recesses, 
at lunchtime, and during bus boarding and departing.
 
 
Teachers, staff and administration, regularly review with students the school
-
wide expectations for appropriate behavior. The three behavioral 
expectations are around safety, respect, and responsibility in school, class, and on the playground.  Students wi
ll continue to be encouraged to display 
appropriate behavior through positive rewards such as verbal praise, citizenship awards, Dojo points, and participation in sp
ecial grade level activities. 
We  encourage students to improve their behavior, and to be g
reat role models today and in the future. Discipline referrals are given when school
-
wide 
expectations for behavior are not followed.
 
 
We revise our School Safety Plan annually. The plan includes procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and inventories of 
emergency supplies. Each 
teacher has a copy of the plan in the classroom along with an emergency bag. We practice emergency drills on a regular basis.
 
The school safety 
committee inspects the school three times a year. After each drill and site inspection,
 
the safety committee discusses what was noticed, and the Safety 
Plan is revised accordingly.

Writing is an area of focus at the district and school site level. The district selected 
communication skills through speaking and writing as an instructional 
practice priority. At Morrison, our previous student data reflected a need in writing. Therefore, our teachers will receive o
ngoing staff development from 
our consultant Jennifer Richter
 
around the three genres of writing: narrative, informational and opinion/argumentative writing. Teachers are meeting 
bi
-
monthly within their grade level teams to implement the Professional Learning Community (PLC) Protocol in order to create SMA
RT goals, 
rubrics, 
analyze student work and determine next steps for instruction.
 
 
Additionally, our Common Core leads will be trained by the District, around the instructional practice priorities: designing 
learning experiences that 
develop students' communication 
skills through speaking and writing, fostering meaningful and purposeful collaboration among students, and planning 
for rigor and relevance through effective lesson design. Through staff development, the Common Core site team will plan and s
hare out the in
formation 
provided by the District.
