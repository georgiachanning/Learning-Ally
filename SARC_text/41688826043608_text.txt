Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Principal's Message
 
Washington Elementary exemplifies a true neighborhood elementary school. Our community embraces all aspects of our 
students' learning from academics to their social and em
otional development.  Our teachers work together in professional 
learning communities, reviewing student data in order to develop the most appropriate instruction for each Washington 
student.  On any given day you will meet parents volunteering in the clas
sroom, monitoring the playground, or supporting 
our library program.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are invited to join Washington's School Site Council, which works with administration to make financial decisions. 
Parents of English Learners are vital to our ELAC and to our outreach efforts on behalf of new families. Room parents 
organize parent
 
volunteers to help with special projects in the classroom, chaperone on field trips and lunch supervision. 
The PTA supports numerous needs of the school, including supplies, assemblies, books for the library and community 
activities including Multicultura
l Night, Winter and Spring Concerts and our annual fundraising event, WAM JAM!  Our 
school also has have an active Dad's Club that hosts numerous community events including the Pasta Feed, Open House 
BBQ,
 
Pancake Breakfast and a wonderful science
-
based Dis
covery Day! The Burlingame Community for Education is another 
important way for parents to become involved in the school and district community.  This organization donates more than 
2 million dollars to our district each year to support all schools. They a
re always looking for parents at each site to help 
support our district.  We ask all parents to attend Back

School Night, Open House, and parent

Staff and/or parent volunteers monitor the school grounds before school, at recesses, and at lunchtime. Teachers regularly 
review the rules for safe and responsible behavior. We have a fully fenced, closed campus. Visitors must enter the school 
through the
 

CPR as well as the use of the portable defibrillator.  We also have staff monitor before and after school drop

We believe that ongoing professional development is the hallmark of our educational system in Burlingame. Teachers and 
administrators review student achievement data and choose topics relating to the most pressing issues from the previous 
year. Our teacher
s attend conferences outside the district and workshops within the district. Faculty meetings include 
professional development activities, and the staff collaborates on a regular basis.  Teachers new to our district our new to 
a grade level continue receiv
e coaching in our SWUN mathematics program, which includes frequent data analysis to 
inform instruction. Kindergarten and first grade teachers are participating in a one
-
year pilot of the Lucy Calkins Phonics 
Units of Study. The district's Director of Inno
vation leads our 4th and 5th grade teachers professional development funded 
by the L3 Silicon Valley Community Foundation grant. Teachers explore ways to integrate math and literacy. Beyond that, 
we capitalize on our homegrown expert teachers and frequentl
y plan opportunities for teachers to lead the professional 
development for their colleagues.
