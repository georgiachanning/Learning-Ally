Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which

the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
General funds are principally utilized to 
provide a qualified staff, curriculum, and facility that supports the academic and 
behavioral growth of all students. In addition to the core curriculum, funds are utilized to provide an athletic program for 
students in grades 4 
-
 
8, STEM activities for al
l grade levels, technology resources that enhance the delivery of instruction 
as well as providing students access to relevant and real
-
life resources.
 
 
Supplemental funds are principally directed towards unduplicated students, including low income, foster
 
and homeless 
youth, depending on grade level, are monitored, using a research based assessment, in letter naming and sounds, non
-
sense words, reading fluency, and comprehension, math facts and math  for a minimum of two times in each school year 
and that 
students falling in the intervention areas for each assessment will be provided with appropriate services to 
achieve at grade level or to make progress toward closing the achievement gap.  The primary assessment utilized is iReady. 
Curriculum
-
based assessm
ents are also utilized along with state assessment data. Additional services are provided through 
targeted intervention within the Learning Center by a .4FTE intervention teacher, access to the online iReady program for 
students in grades TK
-
8, and the SIP
PS program. A district curriculum administrator/training works with grade level 
teachers as we strengthen small group Tier I  interventions within the classroom provided by the classroom teacher and 
paraprofessional assistance. Providing direct interventio
n services by an intervention teacher insures the most effective 
level of service to unduplicated students in that students will receive targeted instruction through the learning center and 
the classroom teacher receives support through collaboration and r
esources provided by the intervention teacher.
