By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The California State Board of Education 
reviews elementary level textbooks and adopts those that meet standards defined 
in the Common Core State Standards. Textbooks are selected in the Redlands Unified School District through a committee 
of teachers and administrators. They review the materials
 
that have been approved for purchase. Teachers at each site 
have an opportunity to preview texts prior to selection. Textbooks are selected and purchased on a seven
-
year cycle, 
rotating by content area. Copies of student books are available at the Instruc
tional Resource Center for parent review.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The current school building, which includes twenty
-
three cla
ssrooms, a library, a math lab/Bears closet, an administrative 
office, and a multi
-
use room/cafeteria was built in 1969. Four relocatable classrooms were added in 1987. Two additional 
relocatable classrooms were added in 1991. Students and staff work hard 
to keep the campus clean and safe. A litter
-
free 
environment is encouraged and custodians clean the campus daily. The governing board has adopted cleaning standards 
for all schools in RUSD. A summary of these standards is available at the school office, at
 
the District Office, or at 
www.redlands.k12.ca.us. Site administration works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure 
a clean and safe school. The school district's maintenance department performs major repairs and improvemen
ts. The 
AHERA Management Plan, Inspection Report, and Operations and Maintenance Program Report are on file in the 
Kingsbury office. A site safety inspection is conducted monthly.
 
 
The staff and community has developed/approved a comprehensive disaster 
plan.  This plan is communicated to the 
students and drills are conducted on a monthly basis.  This written plan is also available to the community. This plan will 
enable staff and students to remain as calm as possible while they deal with the events surr
ounding a disaster such as an 
active
-
shooter, earthquake or fire.
 
 
Kingsbury School was completely modernized in 2004. As a result, our facilities are in excellent condition. Our campus is 
monitored closely by the staff, and any safety hazards are addresse
d immediately.
 
 
In the summer of 2018, the campus became completely enclosed by the addition of new security fencing and gates.  This 
ensures no authorized access to the campus, except by entry to the office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There are many opportunities 
for parents to become involved at Kingsbury School. These include: assisting in the 
classroom by tutoring students in all subject areas (we encourage parents to visit the office for volunteer opportunities 
and procedures), assisting and chaperoning field t
rips, volunteering for PTA, ELAC, School Site Council, and other school 
sponsored activities. Parents also have the opportunity to attend a variety of events such as Family Nights, Parent 
Conferences, Back To School Social, Fall Carnival, and the Book Fair
. Computer technology provides new ways for parents 
to become involved with their child's school and their learning. Kingsbury School maintains a website, and a Twitter page,

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Kingsbury School utilizes 
data from the California Department of Education Dashboard regarding suspension/expulsion 
reports to evaluate the current status of school discipline. A Comprehensive School Safety Plan is adopted in the Spring of 
each school year and is reflective of the 
school's safety needs. Safety committee is invited to each School Site Council (SSC) 
meeting and their concerns are addressed.  SSC creates and monitors the school safety plan.  The key components of 
Kingsbury's Safe School Plan include a description of sc
hool discipline policies and procedures, dress code guidelines, 
suspension and expulsion policies, sexual harassment policies, child abuse reporting procedures, and disaster response 
procedures. Signs are posted to indicate all visitors must report to the 
administration office and may not be on school 
grounds unless they have a visitors pass. New fencing/gates ensure nobody can enter the campus without checking in 
through the office, unless they illegally scale the perimeter.  Visitors must have their licen
se scanned and are run through 
the Raptor Database System to flag sex offenders and unsafe visitors.  Exterior signs also indicate Kingsbury's active video 
surveillance system (there are multiple security cameras mounted throughout the campus to monitor an
d record events).  
To ensure student safety before and after school, campus monitors, teachers, the counselor, the assistant principal, and 
the principal supervise the school grounds including the bus drop
-
off area, cafeteria, and playground.  After school
, 
teachers walk their students to the bus loading area. Teachers, classified staff, and the administration supervise student 
areas until all students have left the campus for home.  During the day, campus monitors are present in the student play 
and eating
 
areas. Also, a crossing guard, provided by the City of Redlands, ensures students cross the street safely.  The 
last update to the Comprehensive School Safety Plan was April 15, 2019.

The Kingsbury staff is committed to continual professional 
growth. Categorical Programs provide funds which enable 
teachers to receive training that align to School, District, State, and Federal goals. Kingsbury's primary focus for 
professional development is around math due to stagnant math scores the last severa
l years.  Funds are available for: a) 
veteran teachers to provide assistance to new teachers in a variety of curricular areas.  b)  teachers to analyze data in 
order to better meet each student's needs by differentiating the instruction c) attend conferenc
es on increasing student 
achievement.  The District provides math, reading, writing, and English Learner professional development.  All Kingsbury 
teaching staff have been trained in Thinking Maps Strategies.  Kingsbury is currently in year four of PBIS (Po
sitive 
Behavioral Interventions and Supports) staff development.  Professional development opportunities are available during 
the regular teaching day, after school workshops, and on instructional minimum days.
