School Description
 
Welcome to JC Crumpton Elementary School. JC Crumpton Elementary School is a transitional 
kindergarten through fifth grade school with aproximately 515 students. Since 2017 Crumpton has 
been an 
identified STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) school within the Monterey 
Peninsula Unified School District. In 2019 Crumpton also started implementing AVID (Advancement 
Via Individual Determination) for 4th and 5th grade students. Students ar
e receiving high quality 
instruction with integrated STEAM components throughout the school day. Crumpton has a 
makerspace where students have access to real life tools and technology to enhance their learning. 
Crumpton  is located in the diverse community
 
of Marina, California. The school has a wonderful 

children. Our highly qualified staff provides each student with a quality education aligned to 
rigorous standards 
and behavior expectations.
 
 
JC Crumpton is a multicultural and diverse learning community that prepares each student for 
academic, social, and personal success by providing a safe, supportive, challenging, and meaningful 
environment. We are committed to pr
oviding the very best that education has to offer to all 
students at Crumpton! Community is paramount at Crumpton, and our active PTA supports many 
school
-
wide events for our families to involve all our students and families in fun community 
activities. Fo
r example, we have a family
-
oriented Terrifying Taco fall festival prior to Halloween 
which is always well attended. We greet new families with a kindergarten BBQ and welcome 
orientation prior to the start of each new school year and last year we had a Lap
-
A Thon which 
proved to be a successful fundraiser for the school.
 
 
In addition to our regular education students, we house a Language Enrichment Academic 
Performance (LEAP) program and a Special Day Class (SDC) program. These programs, overseen by 
our Spe
cial Services Department, supports students of special needs

 
particularly those who have 
a communication disorder frequently identified on the autism spectrum. We include all our 
students in school

students also 
participate in our general education program as determined by an Individual Education Plan (IEP).
 
 
At Crumpton Elementary School, our mission is to provide the highest quality STEAM education in 
a secure, positive, and challenging environment
 
for all students fostered by a cooperative effort 
between school and community.  We aim for an atmosphere of cooperation with respect for 
individual differences and community values.
 
 
Our vision is to create a challenging learning environment that 
encourages high expectations for 
success through the development of appropriate differentiated instruction that allows for 
individual differences and learning styles.  All learners are encouraged to be self
-
sufficient, 
responsible, cooperative and caring m

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Monterey Peninsula Unified School District held a p
ublic hearing on August 2019, and determined that the school had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, incl
uding English learners, are given 
thei
r own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks 
and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of E
ducation, making the textbooks used in the 
school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation 
is made to the School 
Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administra
tors. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district 
office prior to adoption. The table displays information collected in August 2018 about the quality, currency, and availabili
ty of the California Common 
Core standards

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
In 2010, the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District overwhelmingly approved Measure P, a $110 million locally
-
controlled school bond measure to 
fund the first phase of critical repairs and improvement to our loca
l schools. The district's newest school was built in 1965, more than 50 years ago, and 
our Facilities Needs Assessment has identified over $680 million in critical repairs to all MPUSD schools. Recently, in 2018,
 
voters approved Measure I, a 
$213 million s
chool facilities bond by 70%.
 
 
Many school bond projects are underway. Visit www.mpusd.net and search for Measure I & P Dollars at Work for additional detai
ls.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online 
supplement to this report called for by the Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical sys
tems, heating and ventilation 
systems, and more. The impo
rtant purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for
 
this 
assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the si

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eli
gible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

al component of our parent 
involvement program. We encourage parents to participate in the classroom
 
as well as with various volunteer activities on the school site throughout 
the school year. Parents can sign up as a volunteer at the school office.
 
 
Parents will have the opportunity in the new school year to meet monthly with the principal in coffee ses
sions to provide more input about involvement 
and home school connections.  For the 2019
-
2020 school year we are continuing to implement Common Core curriculum. During monthly coffee sessions, 
parents are given the opportunity to view, provide input and ga
in knowledge regarding the curriculum.
 
 
Consistent communication between parents and school is crucial for supporting all students. Crumpton implements class dojo an
d parentsquare school 
wide as the primary communication tools. Crumpton also implements mon
thly home newsletters and monthly PBIS newsletters that include the monthly 
character traits.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; 
and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The safety and well being of students and staff are high priorities for the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District and th
is school. Under Senate Bill 
187, every school in the 
district is required to complete (or review and update) a School Safety Plan by March 1 of each year. The plan is reviewed an
d 
evaluated by the School Safety Planning Committee, the School Site Council, and the school principal before being presented t
o th
e Board of Education 
for final review and adoption. The approved plans are posted on each school's website, as well as the district website at www
.mpusd.net.
 
 
Highlight's of this school's plan are detailed below.
 
 
The Crumpton campus is a safe, clean, and 
healthy learning environment for students, parents, teachers, and staff. To help reduce inappropriate 
behaviors at school, students who disrupt the learning environment face a variety of both intervention supports and disciplin
e measures. Crumpton has 
an e
stablished PBIS (Positive Behaviors Intervention and Supports) Tier I/II/III teams. The PBIS team meets monthly to discuss an
d support students. 
During the 2018
-
19 school year, Crumpton has teamed up with Monterey County Behavioral Health to help expand re
sources for our Crumpton students.
 
 
Supervision staff are scheduled before school, and during both morning and lunch recess periods.
 
 
Wrought iron fencing was installed in the front of the school during the 2012
-
2013 school year. In the summer of 2014, new
 
school wide heating was 
installed. Crumpton will start additional improvments to the school starting in the 2019
-
2020 school year. MPUSD continues to place student and school 
safety as the top priority. The district and site administration conduct a facil
ities safety audit once a year. We implement visitor policies at JC Crumpton. 
All visitors must report to the use and sign in and wear visitor pass to go to a destination at school. During the 2019
-
2020 school year, additional fencing 
surrounding the new p
ortables on campus were installed.
 
 
In March of 2013, the school safety plan was revised to include the implementation of the Positive Behavior Intervention and 
Support (PBIS) program, a 
district
-
wide initiative, supports our no tolerance for bullying poli
cy. A range of interventions are in place to limit bullying behavior. We have a progressive 
discipline policy centering on respect and responsibility taught through our character
-
education program called Second Step. Trained student conflict 
managers assis
t students on the primary playground to resolve conflicts peacefully. Teachers routinely review playground and school safety 
rules within 
each classroom. All Crumpton staff continue to implement PBIS and celebrate the program through awards, school wide as
semblies and incentive 
programs. Crumpton continues to build on it's existing PBIS plan to include more stakeholders.
 
 
Many people visit the campus to volunteer in the classroom and participate in classroom events. Parents and visitors are welc
omed and are
 
required to 
check in at the school office upon arrival and obtain a visitors badge; visitors are required to return to the school office 
upon departure. Crumpton has a 
School Safety Plan that we provide to students and staff, which includes disaster proce
dures for both routine and emergency situations. This plan is 
practiced and updated routinely as per district policy. Crumpton conducts monthly fire drills and at least one earthquake dri
ll a year. In the 2018
-
2019 
school year, lock
-
down procedures were up
dated and will continue to be practiced in the upcoming school year.  All Crumpton staff have taken courses 
and certified in the ALICE training. Crumpton will continue to implement and prepare students for intruders on campus during 
the 2019

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
As in previous years, Crumpton teachers participate in weekly professional development meetings for an hour on Tuesdays immed
iately after school. At 
the end of the school year, teachers reflect and identify areas they would like to focus on for the following year. For the 2
019
-
2020 school year teachers 
would like to focus on STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, AVID, Mathematics), Guided Reading an
d Mathematics. Through this process teachers 
set goals for each area by trimester and collect evidence of student learning. At the end of the trimester there is a share o
ut of effective first instruction 
and student grwoth. Resources are shared so other Cr
umpton teachers can leverage the effective practices already prevelant throughout the campus.
 
 
Teachers also have opportunities to collaborate through weekly Professional Learning Communities (PLC's) where they look at s
tudent work samples, 
assessment data
 
and create an action plan. The questions utilized during this time is anchored in the continuous improvement cycle.
 
 
In addition to site based professional development, teachers and staff participate in district wide professional development 
at a district
 
level.

Types of Services Funded
 
At Crumpton Elementary we have many services available to students. For example, we have a family service specialist to suppo
rt the 
social
-
emotional 
well being of the students. Crumpton provides after school tutoring for struggling students in language arts and math. Crumpt
on also has many extra 
curricular activities throughout the school year available for students including soccer, f
lag football and talent shows. We also offer a Saturday Learning 
Academy option for students to attend half a day learning enrichment activities. A majority of funding reported as districtwi
de costs is expended for 
school level expenditures, therefore the 
results appear to be lower operating costs at the school site level.
