Annual Schoolwide Plan Review
 
Members of the Lincoln Leadership Team, staff members, and parents review the Lincoln School 
Plan for Student Achievement 
throughout the year. Planning for updates and revisions takes place 
at the conclusion of the school year. Updated information is added to the official document at the 
beginning of the next school year. A special emphasis is placed in meeting all objectives
 
in the plan 
according to the timeline established for their completion.
 
 
In order to meet the requirements of the Common Core Standards, Lincoln Elementary School is 
continually in the process of aligning core curriculum as well as implementing targeted i
ntervention

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our school has a Safe School Plan that is in place and updated yearly by the School Si
te Council. Evacuation drills are scheduled on a regular basis to 
ensure that staff and students know what to do in an emergency. A Cal
-
OSHA representative attends monthly meetings and provides updates to staff on 
safety and health issues. In addition to t
hese programs, adequate supervision is provided before school, during break/recess, at lunch, and after school 
and is noted on the school's duty schedule.
 
 
All school district facilities are supportive of teaching and learning. Classrooms are clean and ord
erly and provide a safe learning environment reflective 
of student work and current curriculum. Our school has a cafeteria that provides students with a breakfast and lunch program 
and is used as a multi
-
purpose facility for large
-
scale programs and meetin
gs. The school library provides students with supplemental materials and additional educational 
resources. The school grounds are kept clean and well maintained for school play, recreation, and athletic activities.
 
 
We take pride in our well
-
maintained bui
ldings and landscaping. The Tulare City School District employs skilled professionals to ensure a safe and clean 
environment throughout the school year. Students, staff, and parents are committed to keeping our campus clean and litter fre
e.
 
 
The Tulare Cit
y School District provides ongoing maintenance, and routine and major repairs for all permanent and portable buildings to gua
rantee all 
schools in the district are in good working order and condition. Additionally, school restroom facilities for pupils are
 
maintained so that they are functional 
and meeting hygiene standards generally applicable to public facilities, including operational toilets and sinks in all restr
ooms. The district has established 
a facilities inspection system to ensure that all school
 
buildings meet the standards listed above.
 
 
The school grounds, buildings, and restrooms are kept clean, safe, and regularly maintained. We have a morning custodian from
 
6:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. 
and an evening custodian from 12:30 P.M. to 9:00 P.M. Custodia
ns are regularly monitored and evaluated by the building principal and a director of 
custodians to make sure that all schools are safely maintained and cleaned. In addition to the assigned school custodians, th
e district has a general 
maintenance crew that
 
takes care of more technical repairs (plumbing, heating, cooling, gas, electrical, carpeting, painting, major repairs, and so
 
on.) At 
times, the district will hire an independent contractor to handle repairs that may be beyond the scope of the district's 
resources. Repairs are made on an 
ongoing basis, and the district has a work order repair procedure that begins with the school principal referring needed repa
irs that cannot be taken care 
of by the site custodians to the district superintendent. The super
intendent assigns the repairs to the maintenance director who, in turn, assigns the 
work out to the different maintenance specialists. Work orders are completed on a timely basis. We have a school site safety 
representative who attends 
ongoing safety meeti
ngs.
 
 
Lincoln School was constructed in the late 1920's and includes 33,225 square feet. It is located in the southeast part of Tul
are in a neighborhood that has 
benefited from redevelopment funding, and resulted in the construction or reconstruction of hu
ndreds of homes in the area surrounding the school 
campus. The campus is located adjacent to the César Chávez Park, which is utilized by staff and students as part of the campu
s playground. An 
amphitheater, picnic benches, playground, and baseball field ar
e shared with the city of Tulare.
 
 
Modernization funding during the 2003
-
2004 school year provided for the reconstruction of eight classrooms. With a library that includes approximately 
4,000 books, we are always looking for ways to provide 
additional resources for children.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the
