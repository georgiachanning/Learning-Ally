School Description
 
Principal's Message
 
At James Monroe, our focus is on academic and social
-
emotional growth for all students regardless 
of race, ethnicity, religion, home/first language, socio
-
economic status, special education needs, 
and previous academic success or struggles.  Our vision is 
to foster long term friendships that will 
create a lasting support system, through a connected community for our students and families.  As 
principal, my goal is always to meet the needs of our students and families, creating a sense of 
belonging and accou
ntability to the community, that fosters high levels of academic success with 
rigor, collaboration, and civic engagement.
 
 
James Monroe Elementary School is a Community of Learners

students, staff, families, neighbors, 
community
-

cal San Leandro businesses

who work collaboratively to 
ensure students with a nurturing and safe environment while focusing on an interactive, relevant, 
and equitable education for all children. As a diverse learning community, Monroe strives towards 
acade
mic excellence within an inclusive environment that brings all students and families together. 
Working collaboratively, we strive to close the racial, linguistic, and economic resource gap many 
of our families face, achieving high academic standards for al
l of our children.  We provide many 
opportunities both within the school day as well as the extended day, which supports and enriches 
the lives of our students including targeted intervention, enrichment classes, after school library 
programming, and a com
prehensive full
-
service low cost after school program. Daily access and use 
of technology to enhance learning, is an integral component of our instruction both during the 
school day and during after school hours. We focus on Project Based Learning to make 
education 
relevant, rigorous, and integrated; engaging all students in meaningful learning.
 
 
James Monroe has very active parent organizations. Our Parent Teacher Organization (PTO,) Dad's 
Club, English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC,) School Site Counci
l (SSC,) work together with our 
principal and parent facilitator, to ensure all students meet high standards and are included in all 
aspects of the school. We welcome our community to continue to get involved and become an 
active part of our school. Please

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SA
RC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which
 
describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more informatio
n about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

pertaining to our Safety Plan and emergency preparedness. The School Site Safety plan was reviewed, discussed and updated by 
the SSC and by Monro
e 
Elementary School Staff. It was presented and approved by the SSC on November 14, 2019. The key elements of the School Site S
afety Plan include anti
-
bullying policies and procedures, district discipline policies and documents, child abuse reporting proce
dures, sexual harassment policy, and a section 
devoted to emergency preparedness. Fire, earthquake, and intruder drills are conducted on a monthly basis throughout the scho
ol year. To ensure 
student safety, staff members supervise students at all times bef
ore and after school, and during recess and lunch. All visitors to the campus are required 
to check

District V

the San Leandro Police 
Department in the event of an armed intruder. We have a District Administrator in charge of Safety and Secu
rity who works with the District and our 
school in our planning, training, and support.

Teachers and staff at James Monroe are continually working to improve our practice. The District supports staff development t
hrough three Professional 
Growth Days each year. At the site level we are continuing to consistently implement English Language Dev
elopment instruction and Academic Language 
Development, regrouping students based on their language level/needs. Teachers meet weekly for 50 minutes and monthly for 90 
minutes to work on 
implementing district curriculum and initiatives, incorporating best 
practices in the classroom daily. Our main focuses this year are English Language Arts 
and Science, integrated with Project Based Learning.
 
 
Teachers regularly receive support from District coaches who work to improve daily teaching practices, provide supp
ort for teachers to reflect and stay 
current with technology, implement the best teaching strategies and District curriculum, as well as other areas of need. The 
principal visits classrooms 
regularly, providing feedback to support teachers as they are cont
inuously reflecting and improving their practice. Teachers and staff are also supported 
by our Intervention Specialist who helps in the area of push in classroom intervention, and small pull out groups for remedia
tion of curriculum.
 
 
First and second year 
teachers are additionally assisted by BTSA (Beginning Teachers Support and Assessment) support providers.
