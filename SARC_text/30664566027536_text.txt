School Description
 
 
Principal's Message
 
Welcome to Beatty School, home of the Colts. We wish to share our annual School Accountability 
Report Card which provides valuable 
information about our school's instructional programs, 
academic achievement, classroom materials, school safety, facilities, and staff.
 
 
In order to support the learning of all students, Beatty School implements a Multi
-
Tiered System of 
Supports (MTSS) to 
provide Academic, Social, and Behavior Supports.  A comprehensive Positive 
Behavior Intervention Support (PBIS) is put in place to support student behavior. All students 
receive the appropriate intervention to support, strengthen, and extend individual stu
dent 
achievement. The Beatty staff takes pride in ensuring the success of all students through the setting 
of high standards and providing a rigorous curriculum and interventions that meet the needs of the 
whole child.
 
 
At Beatty School, staff and 
parents work together to create a learning environment that promotes 
academic and social development, teaches responsibility and pride, and models learning as a 
lifelong adventure. Together and through our hard work, our students are challenged to reach th
eir 
maximum potential and be prepared to successfully meet the demands of the future. We are proud 
of our school and welcome you to join our efforts to create successful and responsible world 
citizens.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
"Beatty School embraces diversity a
nd develops lifelong learners who contribute to the global 
community."  We, the members of the Gordon H. Beatty School community, along with the Buena 
Park School District community, are dedicated to providing all children with the educational, social, 
and
 
technological skills needed to successfully experience and contribute to the world around 
them. We will engage parents and community members as full partners in helping our children 
develop the ability to work with others, make responsible decisions, and 
continue to learn and grow 

celebrate each child in a safe, healthy, and information
-
rich environment. The caring partnership 
between home, school, and the 
community is nurtured through newsletters, announcements, 
phone calls, conferences, parent training, volunteer programs, business partnerships, and the 
utilization of community resources.

Ab
out the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under th
e Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activiti
es to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

and content of the curriculum frameworks in English/language arts, math, science, and history
-
social science.
 
 
All textbook and support materials are selected from
 
the state's list of approved materials and adopted by the State Board of Education.  Materials 
approved for use are reviewed and a recommendation is made to the Governing Board by a selection committee composed of teache
