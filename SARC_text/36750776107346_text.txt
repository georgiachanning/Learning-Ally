By law (California Education Code Section 60800), all public local educational agencies in California are required to adminis
ter the Physical 
F
itness Test (PFT) annually to all students in fifth and seventh grade. The PFT was administered to our students in Spring of 
2018.  The PFT 
assesses each student's level of health
-
related fitness.  Each teacher designs the curriculum for their physical edu
cation program. Parents 

is allows teachers, 
parents, and guardians to monitor changes in the student's fitness levels.
 
 
Student att
endance averages 94.6%.  Teachers, parents and students value educational learning time. Sandia promotes school attendance 
by offering incentives for perfect attendance.  These and other activities are supported by the Parent Teacher Organization a
nd other
 
parent volunteers.
 
 
Sandia is supported by an active Parent Teacher Organization.  The School Site Council, Associated Student Body and numerous 
volunteers 
round out the support organizations for the school.  The staff and volunteers at Sandia are focused
 
on helping students achieve their 
potential and meeting the rigorous academic standards outlined by the district and state.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California i
s required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies
 
(LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported
 
in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/
sa/

On April 13th, 2017 the Governing Board of the Apple Valley Unified School District of San Bernardino County met in Regular S
ession and approved the 
English Language Arts textbook adoption for gra
des K through six. For grades K through 3, McGraw Hill Reading Wonders was adopted and grades 4 
through 6 adopted Benchmark Advance. On December 7th, 2017 the Governing Board of the Apple Valley Unified School District of

AVUSD is following Board Policy with the process of a new curriculum adoption for 7th and 8th grade, Language Arts. We began 
looking at the State 
approved adoption list in 
January of 2018. Due to the extensive process we chose to extend our adoption into the 2018/19 school year so that our chosen
 
curriculum would be in alignment with that of our 9th 
-
12th grade English Language Arts adoption. Unfortunately, we are a year beh
ind on our plan as 
we are still in the selection and decision making process. Our goal was to begin piloting materials in January  2019 as long 
as our 9th 
-
12th grade adoption 
process was complete. Our 9th 
-
12th grade have been carefully working on alignme
nt and rewriting curriculum that will better fit our needs in the area 
of Language Arts. Our 7th and 8th grade will begin to train on ERWC's through our county offices in January of 2020. ERWC's a
lign with the direction that 
our 9th

12th grade are conside
ring.

The district held a public hearing on September 6,  2018 to validate the availability of standards

adopted textbooks and instructional 
materials to each pupil. The Board ad
opted Resolution #1819

eighth week of school, sufficient textbooks or instructional materials, or both.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible studen
ts 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

School Safety Plan
 
Safety and security are a key priority at Sandia Academy. We
 
recognize that a safe, secure and attractive learning environment is absolutely vital to the 
educational process. To that end, the staff works together to ensure that the school facilities are properly maintained and t
hat safety considered in 
everything w
e do. The Safety Committee reviews and makes recommendations for repairs to facilities or changes in policies. In the spring 
of each year, 
the committee meets to review and revise the comprehensive school safety plan.  The Safe School Plan contains informa
tion on school programs, safety, 
emergency procedures, discipline, child abuse, suicide prevention and sexual harassment reporting policies. At the beginning 
of each year, the School 
Safety Plan is reviewed with the school staff and the school site council
. Safety Committee meetings are held four times a year. Safety concerns are 
addressed with the staff at these meetings. The school wide discipline plan is printed in the Parent Student Handbook (locate
d on the school website) 
and is reviewed with students 
in the classroom and at assemblies for each grade level. Students enrolling after the first of the year are given a copy of 
the Parent Student Handbook. Fire, disaster preparedness and lock down drills are held monthly on a rotating basis.
 
 
The Sandia Safe
ty Committee meets four times a year and is comprised of administration, teachers, classified staff, and parents. For informa
tion and 
input, the committee invites community and district staff to their meetings. The Safety Committee plans and conducts fire,
 
earthquake, and lock down 
drills. The safety committee asks that parents and employees make them aware of all safety questions and concerns. When a pro
blem is recognized, the 
safety committee works to resolve the concern. The safety plan was approved by t
he School Site Council in October 2019.
 
 

ed up immediately and 
reported to the district office and the school police. The AVUSD Dis
trict Police provide frequent patrols of the school site. This has been effective in the 
prevention of vandalism.
