School Description
 
At Spruce 
Elementary School administration, teachers, parents, and the community are working 
collaboratively to meet the diverse learning needs of all our students. Spruce is continually working 
towards excellence and success for all students. This will be achieved 
through staff professional 
development focused on best practices, rigorous curriculum and the alignment of instruction, RTI, 
intervention and standards based instruction focused on Common Core and the daily use of 
Academic Language.
 
 
Other foci are improvi
ng parent participation and developing student pride, with a strong focus on 
character trait, to help ensure a successful future for all students. This is encouraged with the 
implementation of Positive Behavior Intervention Support Systems. Spruce teachers
 
and staff 
continue to focus on working in a Professional Learning Community to ensure school wide 
implementation of Academic Language, Best Teaching Practices, data
-
based decisions, and rigorous 
alignment to CCSS.
 
 
In addition to carefully calibrating aca
demic instruction, Spruce also focuses on developing the 
whole child. To that end, fifth graders who apply to serve on the school leadership council assist 
the school in creating a positive, welcoming school climate. In addition to the council, students al
so 
have the opportunity to serve on junior patrol, helping to increase campus safety and encourage 
leadership development. Other extra
-
curricular activities include the Homework Club, Community 
Learning Center, Parks and Recreation programs, and a variety 
of after school tutoring services. 
This year we will continue to focus on increasing exposure to reading and writing by providing 
positive incentives for students achieving Accelerated Reader points and completing the 100
-
book 
challenge.
 
 
Beyond academic a
nd extra
-
curricular activities, Spruce is dedicated to partnering with parents and 
our community to improve the teaching and learning. Other parent outreach opportunities include 
PTA, SSC, ELAC, and a variety of family nights and parent education classes. 
In addition, this year 
Spruce Elementary will continue to implement the Latino Literacy Program. This is a 10 week 
session course that is designed to foster parent engagement through literacy. It is also beneficial in 
creating parent leaders who will promo
te a quality and complete education that includes the arts 
in their schools.
 
 
Spruce Mission statement
 
Spruce is an engaging school environment providing all learners opportunities to thrive through 
collaboration, intellectual curiosity, and discovery, 
enhancing their personal and academic growth.
 
We are a community partnership fostering the development of the independent thinker, leading 
to individuals that contribute to communities and cultures beyond the classroom.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in
 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educati
onal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, 
data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.
ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, 
parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

This section provides information on the annual number of school days dedicated to staff 
development for the most recent three
-
year period.
 
 
All teachers in the South San Francisco Unified School District have the opportunity to participate in formal, full
-
day professional development days 
scheduled as part of the district calendar. The staff 
development is a collaborative effort between district values, district
-
led work, and site specific 
training and development. Spruce Elementary teachers work as grade level PLC teams every Wednesday to closely analyze assessm
ent site
-
based, district, 
and s
tate data. Staff development is scheduled bi
-
weekly on Tuesdays through faculty meetings and professional development sessions guided by 
administration, ELD & ELA TOSA and facilitated by our designated teacher leaders. In 2018
-

velopment plan focused on ELD 
through the use of Academic Language (Be Glad),SST/RTI, PBIS, Best Teaching Practices, Reader's and Writer's Workshop, Studen
t engagement through 
the process of PLC, and school wide focus on Common Core State Standards and sma
ll group intervention. These are the areas of Foci that received on
-
going professional development and support. The Spruce leadership team collaborates as a faculty and staff to strategically f
ocus on school wide 
implementations that increase all students'
 
learning. In order for Spruce to see improvement we desire, all stake holders must collaborate fully, share 
practices, plan together, and look at data to inform instruction and interventions. Teachers regard their professional learni
ng as essential to the
 
continued 
success of Spruce students.
