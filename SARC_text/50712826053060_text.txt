By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

SCHOOL SAFETY AND CLEANLINESS IS A PRIORITY AT JOSEPHINE CHRYSLER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
 
The Stanislaus Union Elementary School District makes great efforts to ensure that all schools are 
clean, safe, and functional. District 
maintenance staff and school site custodial staff ensure that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and wor
king order 
are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient
 
service and that emergency repairs are given the 
highest priority. 
 
The last FIT report which was conducted in September 2018 by the Stanislaus Office of Education reported our 
facilities to be in "good" condition in all areas.

SCHOOL SITE CLEANLINESS
 
Providing a clean learning and working environment is a district and scho
ol site priority. The Principal works daily with the custodial 
staff to develop priorities that ensure that the health and safety of all who enter our school are taken care of. 
 
This includes, but not 
limited to: 
 
roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioni
ng, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, floor systems, and quality of 
cleanliness. 
 
 
 
SCHOOL SITE MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS
 
In the 2009
-
2010 school year the flooring was replaced in rooms 40 and 45. During the 2011
-
2012 school year maintenanc
e and repairs 
included bathrooms being updated, office and staff room carpeting, installation of gutters, and two playground drinking fount
ains. 
Maintenance projects during the 2012
-
13 school year include bathroom renovations, installation new drinking fou
ntains, all buildings 
painted, all wooden fencing replaced and a new door in the front office. Maintenance projects during the 2013
-
14 school year include 
bathroom renovations and classroom and library carpeting. In 2014
-
2015 school year, a canopy was buil

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education populati
on and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the re
quirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
