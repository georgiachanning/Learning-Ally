School Description
 
 
Message From Principal
 
Welcome to Bristow Middle School 

 
A CALIFORNIA DISTINGUISHED SCHOOL and CALIFORNIA 
GOLD RIBBON SCHOOL. We are proud to share information about our great school through the 
School Accountability Report Card.
 
 
At Bristow we believe that purposeful connectio
ns with students are a critical strategy to ensure 
success for all students. To continue to support student connections our mastery schedule is built 
around Interdisciplinary Teams, providing small learning communities for students. The 
department teams ar
e provided a common preparation period to plan instruction and analyze 
student learning using a Professional Learning Community model.  Both Interdisciplinary Teams and 
Departments also have regular Collaborative Learning Time a few times monthly to suppor
t 

-
emotional, and behavioral growth.   Our Advisory program strives to 
build a positive school culture for the Bristow community. Advisory meets four days each week.
 
 
Weekly, teachers meet during our Collaborative Learning Time (C
LT). During CLT we work 
collaboratively in Professional Learning Communities to analyze student learning, share best 
practices, support students academically and  behaviorally, develop common formative 
assessments to analyze and guide student learning, str
engthen English Language Development and 
Instructional Support programs, vertically articulate between grade levels, build our team structure 
and learning strategies to provide Math, English Language Arts, and behavioral interventions as 
needed. The Bristo
w staff is actively working toward raising student achievement. We are 
intentional in our work supporting BUSD Literacy Practices.  Our Departmental teams engage in the 
Collaborative Learning Cycle to plan, implement, and reflect on student learning and in
struction.
 
 
Thank you for reviewing the Bristow School Accountability Report Card!

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Brentwood Union Elementary held 
a public hearing on Sept. 11, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of Californ
ia. All stu
dents, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a 
cycle developed by the California Department of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by a
ll teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a select
ion committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. The table displays information collected in Sept. 
11, 2019 about the quality, 
currency, and avai
lability of the standards

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of the Brentwood Union School District.  The district and schools are in co
mpliance with all laws, rules, 
and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The School Site Sa
fety plan was last reviewed and updated 3/1/2019 
by the School Safety Committee. All revisions were communicated to the both the classified and certificated staff.  The schoo

plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safet
y during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school 
year.  Lockdown and Lockout drills are held twice a year. Students are supervised before and after school and during lunch by
 
certificated and classified 
s
taff and the principal. Parent volunteers help with supervision during lunch and break periods. There is a designated area fo
r student drop off and pick 
up. All visitors are required to check in at the office upon arrival and before departing from the scho
ol campus.  Visitor badges are issued at the time of 
check
-
in and are to be worn throughout the visit.  All visitors are scanned by our Raptor Visitor system.
