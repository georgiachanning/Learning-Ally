By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Valley's mission reflects that of the Poway Unified School District: to build college & career readiness for all students 
through a rigorous, engaging, standards
-
based curriculum. Traditionally, discussions of college
-
readiness have been 
confine
d to high schools. At Valley, we believe that the awareness of post
-
secondary opportunities must be built from the 
first day students enter school. Beginning in kindergarten Valley teachers instill in their students the understanding that 
"after high schoo
l comes college." Classes adopt a university of their own and display college
-
related banners, t
-
shirts and 
other visuals to bring the presence of the university right into our elementary school classrooms. But college
-
readiness is 
more than just knowing a
bout college. It is most important to receive high
-
quality instruction that ensures mastery of the 
standards proscribed by the State in the Frameworks for Public Instruction. To provide a strong, coherent instructional 
program for all our students, teacher
s work together both within and across grade levels to coordinate curriculum, track 
student achievement data, and plan together for the success of each Valley student.
 
 
 
 
Built in 1962,
 
Valley Elementary School is one of twenty
-
five elementary schools in t
he Poway Unified School district. It is 
one of the three original elementary schools located in the heart of the community of Poway and
 
is located next to the 
City Library, Sheriff Station, Fire Department, City Hall, and Community Center.
 
 
Valley is proud
 
to be a part of the No 
Excuses University network of schools. We pride ourselves in the continuous improvement of Six Exceptional Systems that 
improve student achievement. Staff and students see their learning through the lens of a growth mindset and let 
No 
Excuse stand in the way of student success. Approximately 720 students are currently enrolled in transitional kindergarten 
through fifth grade. Overall enrollment has remained stable with a rich and diverse student demographic. Students live in 
upper, m
iddle, and lower income single
-
family homes, apartments, and mobile homes.
 
 
 
Valley Elementary is a school wide Title 1 school, meaning that the school receives federal funding to provide services to 
children identified by the school as failing, or most at
 
risk to meet the state's academic content standards. Title 1 funds 
are used to support methods and instructional strategies that are proven to be effective and strengthen the core 
curriculum for students at risk of failure. This is done through daily smal
l group instruction to struggling students along 
with coaching of classroom teachers from the school's TOSA's and educational consultant.
 
   
 
Dual Language (Spanish) Immersion Program is provided for students K through fifth grade. Valley also provides
 
a f
ull day 
program for Kindergarten students. This school is also on a modified calendar, which serves to shorten the time that 
students are away from school during the summer, strengthening the consistency of all learning opportunities. Head Start 
provides c
hildcare in the Boys and Girls Club for three and four year olds. On
-
site preschool programs for three and four 
year olds includes state
-
funded, parent participation, and fee based programs. An onsite Homework Club is provided for 
over 100 students each da
y through a community group.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Poway Unified School District ensures that students 
attend clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each of its schools is maintained in good repair.  A work 
order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and well m
aintained.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A night custodial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms and offices daily.  
The district has adopted cleaning standards for all schools.  A summary of these standards is availab
le at the district offices.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Valley places strong emphasis on safety for students and staff. We have clear guidelines for behavior that are focused 
primarily on living out the Character Traits and creating a Safe, Friendly and Respectful scho
ol.
 
 
Our three rules are "We 
work hard, We take care of each other, and We take care of our school."
 
 
These positive behaviors are reinforced through 
daily PA announcements made by the principal as well as classroom instruction by teachers.
 
 
Every teacher 
on campus 
teaches and models one specific expected behavior a day at the beginning of the school year and students are given the 
opportunity to practice the behaviors that are outlined in our "First 20 Days of School Handbook".
 
 
Logical consequences 
for in
appropriate student behavior are communicated and enforced.
 
 
As a result, Valley's climate is calm, orderly and 
welcoming.

Research supports the positive effects professional development has on increasing student learning. All teaching staff is 
afforded the opportunity to participate in district and site sponsored professional development. These workshops are 
presented in a se
mester or year
-
long series and support a wide variety of professional development. These include the 
use of effective instructional strategies, implementing the use of technology in teaching and learning, critical reading, 
writing and mathematics strategie
s, effective use of assessments, positive discipline in
-
services, and cultural proficiency 
training. Teachers and administrators are actively involved in professional development activities at the school, district, 
state, and national level. The Poway Prof
essional Assistance Program (PPAP) provides support for new teachers. Teachers 
are encouraged to participate in the National Board Certification process and recognized by the Poway Unified School 
District when they earn NBCT status.
 
 
 
 
Valley has a strong 
culture of ongoing professional learning for administrators and teachers.
 
 
A math specialist works 
closely with teachers to support their on
-
going learning in methods for teaching highly engaging and challenging math 
lessons aligned to the common core stan
dards.
 
 
Opportunities are given regularly to teachers to observe each other's 
practice to learn from one another.
 
 
This includes regularly scheduled formal "Instructional Rounds" days where a group 
of teachers and the principal visit all Valley classrooms 
to collect objective evidence of improvements in student learning 
and identify needed next steps in instruction to continue growth in student achievement.
 
Through the lesson study 
process teachers plan, deliver and reflect on lessons together, either in pa
irs or entire grade level teams.
 
 
This has led to 
the refinement of lesson delivery and improvements in student engagement and achievement as measured by student 
work and benchmark assessments.
