 School Accountability Report Card
 Reported Using Data from the 2018
-19 School Year
 Published During 2019
-20   By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
   For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.  For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.  For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
  DataQuest
 DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).  Internet Access
 Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-come, first
-served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Salida Middle School teachers and support staff believe that all students can learn if their instructional needs are met.  
Faculty and administration meet regularly to assess student learning, develop curriculum, and plan 
and adjust instruction.  
Teachers hold each other mutually accountable for the success of all students.
 
 
The foundation of the SMS campus is a focus on the academic success of every student.  Academic rigor is the basis on 
which all courses at SMS are buil
t.  Students are held accountable for their work and given the support necessary for them 
to succeed academically. Teachers continuously assess student learning and adjust instruction to help students gain 
mastery of standards.
 
 
The focus during the 2018
-
2
019 school year turned toward teacher professional development with an emphasis on "good 
first instruction," planning for student achievement and the mastery of common core standards.  Scheduled weekly 
collaboration meetings by grade
-
level and content area
 
are used to give teachers the opportunity to work together, 
analyze assessment data, identify essential curriculum standards, develop common formative assessments, and prepare 
instructional units.  Salida Middle School also has an outstanding after
-
school
 
academic support program which is open 
until 6:00 p.m. daily for students, which not only gives students a place to go but also provides academic support for those 
who need it.
