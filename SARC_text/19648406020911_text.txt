School Description
 
Lampton Elementary School serves almost 600 students from 
transitional kindergarten through 
fifth grade. Our school has received several honors for our exemplary instructional program, Our 
awards include the California Distinguished School award,  Title 1 Academic Achievement Award, 
and the California Businesses 
for Education Star School Award.  Lampton's campus is always well 
cared for, and our classrooms are positive and productive places to learn.  The school is adorned 
with State achievement award emblems, three dolphin murals, a beautiful tiled entrance area,
 
and 
a three
-
dimensional wall sculpture done by a local artist.  It is our mission to develop the personal 
skills and academic abilities of each individual student.
 
 
Our students receive a well
-
rounded education at Lampton. Teachers engage students in 
inte
resting lessons, utilizing many effective teaching strategies. Literacy centers, flexible skill 
groupings, and active learning strategies abound. Instruction is designed around state and district 
standards and infused with experiences that integrate subjec
ts and enhance understanding for 
students.  The curricular program is enriched by a strong relationship with the Cerritos Performing 
Arts Center. They provide teacher training and free tickets for classes to attend live theater, dance 
and music productions
. Most students have had the opportunity to attend at least one free 
performance each year.  Lampton's  school wide Positive Behavior Support system has also 
increased positive behavior on campus.  In 2013
-
14 we began implementing Playworks on our 
playgrou
nd.  A Playworks "Team Up" Coach has organized and supervised positive play activities 
for students during recess and lunch. This program has greatly decreased conflict and bullying on 
our campus.

About the SARC
 
By
 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control
 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
s
tate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about t
he school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
At Lampton, parents are partners with the school in the education of our students. We have many ways for parents to participa
te in the life of our school. 
Parents can help their children succeed by holding high expect
ations, reading to them, monitoring their homework, providing encouragement, and 
ensuring that they attend school regularly.  Lampton offers several parent education programs each school year, examples incl
ude sessions such as Family 
Math events, and "Mom 
& Me" Intervention sessions.
 
 
Parents can run for election for our School Site Council, which works with the principal and elected staff members to help ma
ke financial and program 
decisions. Parents of English Learners are invited to attend ELAC meetings. 
Many parents volunteer to help with special projects in the classroom and 
chaperone on field trips. Still others help by doing supportive tasks at home, like cutting things out for kindergarten stude
nts or sewing costumes for a 
class performance. Our PTA r
uns at least two annual fund
-
raisers, as well as several school events, and they always need an extra hand. We ask all parents 
to attend Back
-
to
-
School Night in the fall, Open House in the spring, and parent
-
teacher conferences at the end of the first and 
second trimesters.
 
 
We always need new volunteers, so stop in and see what you can do. Lampton Elementary School has an open door policy. We are 
happy to answer 
questions and provide information or references to anyone seeking assistance. For information a
bout getting involved at our school, please call us at

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Lampton has a monitored security gate at the  main entrance of the school.  Once classes have started for the day, parents an
d visitors must use the gate 
entry panel to gain authorization to 
enter the campus.  Visitors must enter the school through the security gate and sign in at the office, where they 
receive a visitors badge to wear throughout their stay.
 
 
Supervision aides monitor the school grounds for 15 minutes before and after school, as well as at all recesses and at luncht
ime. A full time Playworks 
coach organizes positive play during student recess breaks.  Lampton's Positive Behavior expectations ar
e explicitly taught at the beginning and middle 
of each school year.  Teachers regularly review the rules for safe, responsible behavior in school and on the playground.
 
 
The School Safety Plan is updated annually and shared with the staff at that time. It
 
was last updated in January 2019 and will be revised again in 2020.  
The plan includes information on disaster drills, evacuation routes, disaster teams, and the location of first aid supplies. 
The Safe School Plan is reviewed, 
revised, and approved annua
lly by the School Site Council. The School Safety Plan is available for review in the school's main office.  We hold practice
 
drills for emergencies such as fire, earthquake, or lock
-
down situations.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and 
Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
In 2017
-
18, Professional development for teachers focused on strategies to support the successful implementation of common core stand
ards.  Our 
school focused on learning our new math series called "Math Expressions" Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support, and Pr
ofessional Learning Communities.  In 
2018
-
19, Lampton began its focus on Math Problem Solving.   We held 2 days of professional development on the basic components of 
Cognitively Guided 
Instruction (CGI) in math.  Professional development for teachers was 
conducted two times per month, during after school workshops. During the school 
year, we continued this focus by developing problem
-
solving rubrics and calibrating scoring of student work.
 
 
The focus for 2019
-
20, will expand our work in CGI with 2 addition
al days of summer training focusing on problem types, and linking math routines to 
problems as a scaffold.  Grade level teachers will experience professional learning "Lab days" and visit a CGI school.  TK
-
2nd grade  teachers will also 
receive training on 
Counting Collections, and Choral Counting within a cross
-
school collaborative Lab Day structure.  Teachers will be supported by a 
trimester of coaching by our Cotsen Alumni Mentor, co
-
funded by NLMUSD and the Cotsen Foundation.
