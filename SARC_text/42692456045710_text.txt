talent and dedication within our teaching and support staff.

differences. W
e believe every experience is an opportunity for growth and a path to success! In 
support of this philosophy our teachers endeavor to provide students with a balanced educational 
program that is as rich in academic rigor as it is in the variety of performi
ng arts classes that are

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Los Olivos Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for its students, staff , volunteers, and community. Though t
he program dates back to 
1888, current facilities provide state

art accommodations for a
ll of our students. The current site was rebuilt in 1976 and includes 16 classrooms, 
playing fields, covered eating area, tennis and basketball courts, blacktop play areas, and an administrative office. The sch

gym/auditorium/community center was comp
leted in 1999. This complex also houses a computer lab, library, two science labs/classrooms, and three 
other classrooms for our middle school program.
 
 
A maintenance operation worker/custodian ensures that classrooms, restrooms, and campus grounds are kep
t clean and safe. A scheduled maintenance 
program is administered by the Los Olivos School District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well maintained in
 
order to provide a suitable 
learning environment.
 
 
School bond dollars were used to upgr
ade and expand parking lots, completely renovate the playing fields, and improve security locking systems in the 
classrooms. Construction projects completed in January 2011 resulted in a new two
-
classroom building with attached student restrooms, decks and
 
improved landscaping in student areas, improved site drainage throughout the campus, and improvements in ADA accessibility an
d signage.
 
 
A generous donation given by the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians and the Santa Ynez Elks Foundation paid for the re
furbishing of the tennis courts. 
The courts were completed in April of 2014 and were designed as multi
-
use courts for both tennis and basketball. The Santa Ynez Valley Foundation built 
a beach volleyball court in 2018 for both student and community use.

Sma
rter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligibl
e students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of
