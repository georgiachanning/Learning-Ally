About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Ca
rd (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability P
lan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
Fo
r more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCF
F web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Each year we have designed professional learning based on student achievement data, research of best practices and discussion
s with teachers and 
principals. The specific approaches vary by content area. For ELA, in 2017
-
18, the focus was on aligning instru
ction to Smarter Balanced Assessments, 
depth of knowledge, and deeper understanding of the Reading Targets in Claim 1. In 2018
-
19 the focus was on the gradual release model, and 2019
-
20 
was an extension of the previous two years. The professional developme
nt in these areas was provided by the Schoolhouse Project. In 2018
-
19 the 

ceptual understanding. 
The training will take place over 
the course of three years.  During Year 1 (2018
-
19) the focus was on developing strategies to support number sense by 
implementing mental math routines and highlight the landscape of learning in mathematics. During Year 2 (2019
-
20) the focus is on strength
ening mental 
math routines, identifying the math goal of a lesson, and planning for and implementing a three
-
part lesson (Launch, Explore, Summarize). This 
professional development also supports teachers with the implementation of the district
-
adopted math
 
program (Bridges in Mathematics and Number 
Corner).
 
The numbers in the chart above represent 10 days of ELA training in 2017
-
18. For 2018
-
19 there are 6 days of training for ELA. For the 2019
-
20 school 
year there are 4 days of training for ELA. The 
remaining number of days in 2018
-
19 and 2019
-
20 are full days of professional learning for math.
