School Description
 
Caroline Wenzel School is a caring community of students, parents, and staff dedicated to 
educational excellence. Staff, parents and students have worked to make Wenzel a place where 
studen

recognized for citizenship, attendance, life skills and academic efforts and most of all a place to 
have FUN while learning! The culture and climate of Wenzel are bu
ilt upon a frame of ethical 
leadership focused on the standards of commitment, duty, equity, integrity, ethical responsibility, 
and respect.
 
 
Support services for continuous improvement in student achievement are provided to students.  In 
the 2018
-
19 schoo
l year, our team embarked on doing improvement science work.  This same work 
continues this year as goals in our School Plan for Student Achievement.  Class size is 24:1 in 
Kindergarten; 24:1 in 1st, 2nd and 3rd grades and 33;1 in grades 4

severely developmentally disabled students and an autistic transition class designed to transition 
autistic students into general education
 
classes, as well as 18 full inclusion students and over 80 
speech students, including students from private schools. Our special day classes are fully included 
in all school
-
wide events and programs. English Language Learners (ELL) program is available fo
r 
qualified students in both an integrated and designated approach and is provided a number of 
opportunities throughout the day to have their curricular needs met. To further support our 
students, Reading Partners a reading support and intervention program
, three instructional 
intervention assistants, as well as a bilingual instructional assistant to support instruction and 
learning.  Caroline Wenzel provides a strong PE prep program.  Caroline Wenzel is proud to also 
have a staffed library where students c

expanding services is a family resource support center, providing a variety of support to our school 
and families, including but not limited to mentoring and counseling. For the past three years, 
inclu

opportunities for students.
 
 
Parents and community volunteers are a very strong resource and help to implement the overall 
school program in cooperation with an act
ive School Site Council and the English Learner Advisory 

Program for Conflict Management, and annual events such as an Intermediate Physical Fitness 
Meet, and a Prima

family events such as our Spaghetti Dinner, Carnival, Family Science Night and Movie Nights as well 
as ancillary activities like primary and intermediate school dances.  There is
 
our new Caroline 
Wenzel Academy of Scholars (CWAS) licensed childcare program available for before and after 
school childcare on our campus in addition to the After School Education and Safety (ASES) after 
school program serving nearly 86 students in grad

6th.  Finally, we have an active student 
council that meets once a week with the principal to discuss school
-
wide student issues as well as 
plan student activities. This year, leadership opportunities provided students with opportunities to 
serve 
as technology team, school tour teams, and mentoring team.
 
 
Parents, students, staff, and members of our community are all working together to continue 

inclusive, caring, and small community environment!

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of 
each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formul
a (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local 
priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, pare
nts/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of 
study

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators 
and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including ELA 
Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Ling
uistically Relevant Teaching and Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through this program deeply align with the needs of our ind
ividual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and co
nnect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson design.
 
 
Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outside of contracted hours. In additio
n to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunity for teachers to engage
 
in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening their c
ontent knowledge, strengthening their instructional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of responsibility.
