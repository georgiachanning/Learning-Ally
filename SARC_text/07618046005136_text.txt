Principal's Message
 
Rancho Romero Elementary School is located in Contra 
Costa County.  Our school is one of twenty
-
two elementary schools in the San Ramon Valley Unified School District, one of the highest 
performing large school districts in the state.  Rancho Romero opened in 1959, starting with twelve 
classrooms, kindergart
en through sixth grade.  The culture of our neighborhood school began with 
teachers, parents, and community members coming together as partners and has remained that 
way over the past five decades.  For many of our students, prior generations of their fami
ly 
attended Rancho Romero.  This personal family connection adds to the sense of pride, compassion, 
and inclusiveness that is felt across the community and helps make the school very unique.
 
 
The school has grown since its humble beginnings and today 20 cl
assroom teachers serve 496 
students in TK
-
5.  Additional staff includes Science lab specialist, two Physical Education specialists, 
Reading Specialist, Instructional Technology Teacher, Instrumental Band Teacher Librarian, 
Resource Teacher, Speech and Lang
uage Pathologist and a part
-
time Psychologist.
 
 
Our student enrollment by ethnicity is 67% white, 10% Asian,  9% Hispanic or Latino, 11% two or 
more races and 1% African American.  Three percent (2%) of students are designated English 
Learner. Families ser
ved by the school are college educated and are middle to upper

socioeconomic status.  Education is highly valued and parents have high educational expectations 
for their children.  Parent support for school programs and services through the Ra
ncho Romero 
Education Fund and PTA is strong.  Parent voluntary donations are used for a variety of programs 
and positions such as technology, art, extra science instruction, reading intervention, classroom 
paraeducators, library, social skills interventio
n, noontime sports, and targeted materials and 
supplies.
 
 
Providing a rigorous and meaningful curriculum to our students is a priority.  The school community 
is committed to ensuring positive, challenging, and rewarding academic and social experiences.  
Th
e 2018 CAASPP test results revealed a school
-
wide average in the 3rd
-
5th grade of 74% proficient 
and above in ELA and 78% in mathematics.
 
 
Teachers and the School Site Council strive for continuous improvement by analyzing and 
evaluating multiple forms of 
data to set targeted goals and identify responsible actions that result 
in meeting the needs of all students.  Other measures, in addition to the California Assessment of 
Progress and Performance, include common district benchmark assessments: Running Reco
rds, 
On

based assessments, common pre
-
post assessments, California Healthy Kids Survey, 
District Climate Survey, Physical Fitness Results and easyCBM (Curriculum
-
B
ased Measurement).
 
 
During the last five years significant curriculum, instruction, and program changes have been made 
to align with Common Core Math, ELA/Literacy and Next Generation Science Standards. These 
changes include full implementation of New York
 
Reading and Writing Units of Study, Engage/New 
York Math Curriculum, Next Generation Science Standards, implementation of Wilson Foundations 
Language Basics, real

endship, the strength of 
character, and a sense of community and leadership.  Students are valued and know their participation and contributions make 
a 
difference.  It is widely believed that the fundamental purpose of school is to provide conditions under
 
which all students acquire 
knowledge and essential skills in preparation for the next level of learning and ultimately the world they experience once th
ey leave the 
K
-
12 system.
 
 
Mission:
 
Whatever it Takes
-
Learning for All
 
 
Vision:

every grade level.
 
 
Rancho Romero students will meet high expectations to advance to the next level of learning and gain 
readiness for college and career.  
Teaching and learning will be aligned to California State Common Core Standards in literacy, math, and science.  Students wil
l demonstrate 
independence, build strong content knowledge, develop communication skills, become
 
discerning readers, writers, and listeners,

ctives and 
cultures.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is requir
ed by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) 
are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an L
CAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of

The San Ramon Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a comprehensive, inclusive model of professional development 
for all staff. Our high 
quality professional development program is 
focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy and instructional strategies. 
In 2012
-
13, we established district
-
wide K
-
12 Task Forces in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along with targeted profession
al 
development offerings. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and t
he Silicon Valley Math 
Initiative. Both organizations are highly respected and have strong ties to the development and implement
ation of the CCSS and professional learning 
offerings.
 
 
These learning experiences are supported with on
-
site coaching provided by a team of instructional coaches who work and train together. The coaches 
received certification as Common Core trainers throug
h the Leadership and Learning Center. They provide one
-
to
-
one coaching, team and grade level 
coaching, whole school professional development, in addition to targeted cross
-
grade level, cross
-
discipline professional development sessions. These 
trainings con
nect to every aspect of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, intentional instructional practices, formative ass
essment for 
learning, and lesson design.

In addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach
-
le
d cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting. 
These cohorts are both semester
-
long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for 
Innovators to Problem Solving Strategies. T
here are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously.
 
 
We ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project (formerly known as BTSA). Our s
ummer intensive 
trainings along with on
-
going staff development days and releas
e day trainings deeply align with the needs of our individual schools and our Framework 
for Excellence: Supporting Students and their Learning; Supporting Staff and their Work.
 
 
Under the leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of p
ractices afford our staff the opportunity to deepen their content 
knowledge, strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of respo
nsibility. As a result, every 
staff member helps to promote and n
urture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the district as a whole is enhanced.
