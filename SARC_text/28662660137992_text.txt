Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the re
quirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents can learn about programs
 
and roles in which they can support our students through participation in our School 
Site Council (SSC), Parent University, ELAC and Parent and Faculty Association (PAFA). Parents get involved through 
volunteer work in the library, classrooms, garden, pla
ygrounds and on our educational field trips.  PAFA meets monthly to 
plan and organize fundraisers that provide our school with special programs such as field trips, enrichment programs 
including art, music & dance, interactive school assemblies, and school
 
improvements that enrich our students' 
educational experience.  Through the work of the bilingual parent liaison & parent university coordinator, parent classes 
are offered regularly on topics such as health, parent conferences, understanding test data, e
tc.  Room Parents in each 
classroom help with many projects or activities in the classroom.  School Site Council is composed of parents and school 
staff that meet four times a year to help develop a School Improvement Plan.  Our entire community participat
es in various 
activities/fundraisers such as Jog

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Description: A school
-
wide focus on safety, health and well being has 
resulted in a campus that is virtually free of violence, 
drugs, and crime.  Occasional graffiti from weekend and evening visitors are immediately removed.  Our campus grounds 
are kept clean and are supervised by two full
-
time custodians.  Inspections by th
e Napa Fire Department address code 
compliance and assure that facilities are safe for students and staff.  Our Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP) 
addresses all components of SB187 including biannual Crime Reports, Student Discipline, Sexual Harassmen
t, Dealing with 
Dangerous Pupils, Crises Response Plan, Dress Code, and Alternative Programs.
 
 
The CSSP is reviewed annually by the School Safety Committee and School Site Council which include staff, parents, and 
representatives of law 
enforcement.  Emergency equipment/supplies are available for each classroom and for the school 
as a whole. Evacuation drills are practiced monthly.  Teachers have been trained on "active shooter on campus" and 
teachers have roles in the emergency operation
s plan.
 
 
As part of Willow's BEST program, the first weeks of school and throughout the year, students practice safety, playground 
and school rules, as well as classroom expectations.  The Willow Staff is committed to providing a positive, safe, and 
comfor
table place in which to work and learn.  All members of the school community, staff and parents understand our 
school
-
wide rules, Be Safe, Be Respectful, Be Responsible.  We reinforce positive behavior through individual and class 
recognition.  We reinforc
e monthly character traits and then recognize students at monthly assemblies recognizing their 
accomplishment and learning goals.  The staff gives out "Talon tickets" when students/classes are following rules.  We use 
"Talon tickets" for weekly drawings an
d recognize students with BEST awards at monthly assemblies.

The Willow leadership team and staff analyzed student achievement data to set goals for the year.  Using the district goals 
as the driving force, the school goals aligned to the 
district goals which are college & career readiness using Inquiry
-
based 
instruction, closing the achievement gap, implementing 21st
-
century skills, and healthy living.  We use a data team model 
with a SMART goal cycle to monitor student achievement and pro
gress toward goals.  Teachers received a week of PD 
before right after school was out 6/18 on Inquiry
-
based instruction and Artful Learning.  PD is delivered in a variety of 
ways including after school hours, early release Wednesdays and coaching.  Additio
nally, teachers used a non
-
student day 
10/26 for PD.  Teachers have designated PLC time built into their week and meet regularly with the Magnet Lead teacher 
to look at data, write SMART goals and plan instruction & intervention.
 
 
Willow has developed a 5 
year PD plan focusing on Arts Integration, standards
-
based, arts aligned units of study, ELD, 
technology integration, visible learning, GLAD and more.  Our SMART goal focus this year is on writing and alignment from 
TK
