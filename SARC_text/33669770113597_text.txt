About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educatio
nal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, d
ata reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.g
ov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

ho met the standard (i.e.,
 
achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this c
ategory is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the num
ber that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using only
 
students who received scores.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Stokoe is committed to fost
ering and maintaining an active parent involvement program.  Since success is a shared responsibility, parents are encouraged
 
to be active participants in their child's education in a variety of ways.   Stokoe has a Parent Involvement Policy that outl
ines 
all the ways parents can get 
involved in our school.
 
 
Parents are involved through four specific parent groups:  Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), Action Teams for Partnership (A
TP), English Learners 
Advisory Committee (ELAC) and School Site Council (SSC)
. Participation and attendance in these groups provides parents the opportunity to fully 
understand the workings of the public educational system and programs.  Parents are also encouraged to get involved by attend
ing Back to School Night, 
Open House, Annu
al Title 1 Meeting, Principal's Coffee, Family Nights, Parent
-
Teacher Conferences, monthly Flag Ceremony, semester awards, special 
classroom events, as classroom volunteers and as field trip chaperones.  In addition, fathers, grandfathers and other  male f
amily members are 
encouraged to be part of Watch DOGS (Dads of Great Students) and serve as volunteers and positive male role models on campus.
 
Our ATP  committee 
monitors and develops an annual action plan for parent engagement focused on parent education
 
and student achievement.
 
 
We collaborate with parents and all partners for the benefit of our students and the future of our community.  Communication 
is timely and parent input 
is sought, considered and used to guide decisions that will impact policies a
nd programs offered to support student achievement. Regular communication 
is provided in English and Spanish via personal contact, school marquee, flyers, monthly newsletters, Blackboard  Connect, Pe
achJar (auto email and text 
message), digital apps (REMIN
D and Class DoJo) and social media (Instagram and Facebook) so that parents remain informed of academic learning and 
other school activities.  Parent input is gathered from SSC, ELAC and Principal's Coffee.  Parent workshops are offered throu
ghout the year
 
during ELAC, 
SSC, parent involvement week and TK/Kinder Camp. Translation and childcare are offered during meetings and events and meeting
s are scheduled at 
multiple times of the day to ensure all parents have the opportunity to participate.
