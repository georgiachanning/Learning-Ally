About the SARC
 
By Februar
y 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding
 
Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and
 
local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the schoo
l, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Curriculum development is a district
-
wide effort. Teachers and administrators from all subject areas form working committees to draft recommendations 
on instructional materials.
 
 
The C
alifornia Department of Education has determined textbook selection and adoption schedules. The district follows the state sc
hedule for these 
adoptions and has purchased textbooks from the most recent state
-
approved lists. All approved instructional materi
als are aligned with California content 
standards for core academic areas.
 
 
The Elementary School District Curriculum Advisory Council reviews curriculum recommendations and revisions materials utilize
d in the support of the 
instructional program. The Curr
iculum Council recommendations are forwarded to the Board of Education for final approval. This is an ongoing process, 
assuring that all textbooks and instructional materials are systematically reviewed, updated, and supplemented.
 
 
This table shows 
some of the textbooks used with grade K

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
At Laurel Dell School, the campus is orderly, and students feel safe at school. The school ensures that on
-
site supervision is provided for programs that 
take place before and after school. Beginning a
t 8:30 a.m., there is supervision for those students who have arrived on campus before the 8:45 a.m. start 
time. After school, many of the students participate in the LEAP intervention program for grades 1
-
5.
 
 
District and school policy require that during
 

them for security personnel and all staff and students. The physical quality of the school campus influences teaching and lea
rning. All students 
and faculty 
have a reasonable amount of classroom and open space. The playground is sufficient for the size of the student population and
 
is easily supervised during 
recess. The campus offers sufficient spaces for pull
-
out groups and counseling services.
 
 
Laurel Dell Elementary has been operating in the temporary location at 150 Lovell Street as the modernization of the origigin
al building is taking place.  
The students and staff are eagerly anticipating a January 2020 move back date.
 
 
The district strives 
to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. All bathrooms, classrooms, and offices are cleaned daily. Student
s are 
encouraged to help keep the campus clean by recycling. District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep 
the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. An online maintenance order request process is used to ensure efficient s
ervice and that emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 

e Program, which provided state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with 
expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components, became inoperative effective July 1, 201
3. However, the distri
ct 
continues to make an annual contribution to support capital improvement projects, including deferred maintenance projects.
 
 
San Rafael voters approved Measure A in November 2015 to fund capital facilities projects to improve our school facilities. M

SRCS' bond program is providing much needed capital improvements to our facilities to create safe, innovative learning enviro
nments and to provide 
instructional t
echnology to support 21st century learning. Additional classrooms, labs and equipment are being built and improved to reduce 
overcrowding in our schools and to better meet the growing demand for hands

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System
, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and gr
ade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive
 
disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or

Parent involvement is a vital component of the educational program at Laurel Dell Elementary School. San Rafael City Schools 
would not be what it is 
today without the contribu
tions of countless parents and guardians who give their time and expertise as volunteers and who share their financial 
resources to support the goals and aspirations of San Rafael schools.
 
 
Parents and guardians have the opportunity to play an active role 

council, district and school English language advisory committees, parent teacher associations, district and school site comm
ittees, fundraising campaigns 
and special event
s.
 
 
At Laurel Dell School, specific opportunities for parent participation include the Site Leadership Team, Parent Teacher Assoc
iation, and School English 
Language Advisory Council.
 
 
Parents are also made to feel welcome through various informational and 
community
-
building events, including back

conferences, parent education nights, PTA meetings, parent coffees/Charla Cafes, and student performances.

School Safety Plan
 
Date Reviewed and Updated: August 21, 2019 Date Discussed with School Faculty: August 21, 2019
 
 
Laurel 
Dell has a comprehensive school safety plan covering all aspects of planning for emergency response and student safety. This 
plan is based on and 
coordinated with the district and county emergency preparedness plans. The plan is reviewed with school staff 
at the start of the school year. The plan 
is updated annually to increase preparedness for any emergency, including storms, fire, earthquake, or intruders on campus. T
he school has staff 
members who are trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and fi
rst aid. Disaster drills are held once a semester throughout the year. The school 
also participates in an annual county
-
wide disaster preparedness drill.
 
 
Key elements in the school safety plan include: disaster procedures, abuse reporting procedures, susp
ension/expulsion policies, sexual harassment 
policies, school dress code, and school discipline policies.
