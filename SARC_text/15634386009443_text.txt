School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which 
data were collected:
 
December 2019
 
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 9, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to
 
the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned 
textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. T
extbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making 
the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all 
teach
ers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.
 
The table displays information c
ollected in December 2019 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pa

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parent involvement plays a 
crucial role in the success of our students.  At Orangewood Elementary, parents are 
encouraged to volunteer, assist with large activities, and participate in awards assemblies, field trips, or student activiti
es.  
We have a parent center to discuss things 
such as tutoring tips, parent/teacher communication, home/school 
communication, ways to get involved, family literacy, social media awareness, as well as district and school policies.  One 
such way to get involved is by joining our Parent Teacher Club (PTC
).  Our PTC provides parents and staff the opportunity 
to be involved in a number of student centered activities.  Another way parents can get involved is by running for School 
Site Council (SSC). Parents in this group are involved in writing the school sa
fety plan, and the single school plan for student 
achievement. We also have an ELAC/DELAC group. This group assists and seeks input from our English Language Learner 
(ELL) families.  Each parent is also encouraged to create a Parent Portal Account.  This a
ccount allows the parents to track 
grades and attendance.  It also serves as a communications platform between home and school.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Orangewood has a safety plan that was written and approved by the School Site Council. Our plan spells out the 
responsibilities of each staff member as well as detailed procedures to ensure proper accounting and safety for staff and 
students in 
the event of an actual emergency. In addition to the plan, Orangewood staff and students practice fire drill 
exits monthly and earthquake drills quarterly, and active shooter drills yearly to ensure that all students and staff can exi
t 
the facilities in a 
safe, orderly manner.  A drum of emergency supplies is housed in the book room, next to room one, and 
each classroom has a bag with first aide and other emergency supplies to have on hand. The plan is revised annually and 
the updates are reviewed with scho
ol staff each fall. Copies of the plan are available to the public at the school office.
