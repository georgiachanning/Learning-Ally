By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

John S. Malcom Elementary School, a 2001 National Blue Ribb
on School and a California Distinguished School, serves pre
-
school through fifth grade students. Our school, which opened in September 1994, is located on a scenic bluff less than 
two miles from the Pacific Ocean in beautiful Laguna Niguel. John S. Malcom 
Elementary School prepares students to be 
college and career ready while nurturing character development and problem
-
solving skills. Staff receives the strong 
support of parent and community volunteers in providing many enrichment opportunities across the 
curriculum.
 
 
The Malcom staff is committed to providing a high quality learning environment that emphasizes mastery of grade level 
standards while meeting the individual needs of all students in the core curriculum.  Science, Technology, Engineering, 
Art, 
and Math (STEAM) instruction at Malcom is supported through our outdoor classroom Gerhard Garden, Earth Lab, 
Innovation Lab, Computer Lab, Chromebooks, Primary and Block Music Programs, Art Studio, and a Meet the Masters art 
program. Malcom scholars are fa
ced with daily opportunities to solve real
-
life application problems while practicing the 
skills of communication, collaboration, creativity and critical thinking. In addition, scholars follow the 3R's every day 
(Relationships, Respect, and Responsibility)
 
and work to solve problems inside and outside of the classroom.  The 5th 
grade Student Leaders at Malcom (SLAM) program provides students with ongoing opportunities to participate in 
community service.
 
 
The ultimate goal of the John S. Malcom School Commu
nity is a commitment to make a positive difference in ourselves 
and the world in which we live.
 
 
 
MOTTO
 
 

 
 
 
VISION

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessm
ents for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in t
he administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have
 
successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At John Malcom 
Elementary, parent participation is evidenced through a large volunteer program. Parents provide many 
volunteer hours in the classrooms, assisting individual or small groups of children and doing clerical work for the classroom
 
teacher. Our current Garden 
Science, Garden Leader, and Garden Entrepreneurial programs are led by volunteers with 
support from staff. Additionally, we have our Watch D.O.G.S. (Dads of Great Students) volunteer program to promote 
positive male role models on campus.  Parents often sh
are their unique talents with our students in the arts, with fitness, 
and in science. Our very supportive Parent Teacher Association (PTA) works hand
-
in
-
hand with the school to provide funds 
and programs, which further enrich the school experience for our 
students. In addition, Malcom Elementary is fortunate 
to be supported financially by the Friends of Malcom Foundation, a parent
-
led fundraising group which launches a yearly 
campaign to provide additional resources for the school.

Each Capistrano Unified school site has a School Safety Plan, which includes a comprehensive 
disaster preparedness plan. 
Copies are available to read at each school office. The Safety Plan is updated annually, and reviewed by the Executive 
Director, Safety and Student Services. Aerial pictures and floor plans of each school site are loaded on all 
local police unit 
computers. Fire drills are held monthly in elementary schools, four times per year in middle and two times a year in high 
school.  Drop, cover and hold drills are held each semester in middle and high school and quarterly for elementary. 
Lockdown drills are held twice a year and a disaster drill is held once a year throughout the District. The District also 
participates in multi
-
agency response drills, working with law enforcement , fire and other responding agencies.

Capistrano Unified School District places great value on the role of professional learning, and utilizes systems
-
wide 
structures and strategies to promote continuous 
learning of adults that result in increased learning for students.  The 
ongoing focus for professional learning is to support the district's Wildly Important Goal for Teaching and Learning.  It is 
the district goal to engage students in meaningful, challen
ging, and innovative educational experiences to increase post
-
secondary options for all students.
 
 
It is the goal of  Capistrano Unified School District to ensure all students receive Great First Instruction (GFI).  The visi
on 
for GFI is that all learning 
environments include Lesson Preparation, Interaction, Strategies, and Review and Assessment 
as defined by the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP).  By design, the model for providing professional 
learning is multi
-
tiered, and ranges from larg
e
-
scale, district
-
wide learning opportunities focused on priority areas to site
-
specific, embedded professional learning (including coaching) that supports teachers in the transfer of that learning to the 


school hours to further support district initiatives and teacher needs for ongoing professional learning. The outcome of all 
CUSD professional learning is to improve educator effectiveness in
 
order to increase student learning. In support of this 
outcome, administrators participate in professional learning to increase their knowledge of quality practices, California 
Content Standards, and strategies for instructional leadership.
 
 
Since 2004, a
ll schools provide specific release time for embedded professional learning using late start or early release 
days.  In grades K
-
8, this time is known as ACE time (Articulation and Collaboration for Excellence).  The purpose of this 
time is for educators t
o examine the impact of their practice on student learning, with a focus on continuous improvement.  
Schools work to identify key areas of learning based on an analysis of student data, upon which they place their focus for 
professional learning and set an
nual measurable goals based upon those identified areas of need. These areas are 
determined through the analysis of student learning data from multiple sources, including, but not limited to high stakes 
testing. The action plan developed to accomplish thes
e goals outlines priorities for teacher training and implementation.
 
 
Throughout the year, the structure of collaboration typically involves teacher teams engaging in ongoing examination of 
standards
-
based curriculum, the examination of meaningful formativ
e and summative assessment data, and powerful 
teaching strategies that get results in student learning. In 2017 the District developed the CUSD Professional Learning 

orative teams utilize Common 
Goals, Relational Trust, Focus on Learning, Shared Responsibility, Action
-
Oriented, Data Driven, and Systems and 
Structures for Support  to ensure all students are learning at high levels.  These embedded professional learning 
activities 
help prepare teams to provide a differentiated instructional program that meets the needs of all students.
 
 
Beginning teachers receive systematic training and support during their first two years of teaching within the CUSD 
Induction Program. Th
is program assists new teachers as they build upon the skills they already possess upon entering the 
field of teaching, and provides them with support from a veteran teacher. The program is approved by the California State 
Commission on Teacher Credentiali

to those activities previously described, all teachers may receive support, assistance, and opportunities to grow 
professionally through their participation in school site
 
learning teams, student study teams, from district resource 
teachers, and the Peer Assistance and Review Program.
