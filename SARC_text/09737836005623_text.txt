School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Mission Statement
 
The mission of Northside STEAM School is to enrich and engage our students through a rigorous project
-
based curriculum 


denotes our commitment to not only providing a rigorous and engaging curriculum, but our dedication to supporting the 
social
-
emotional well
-
being and growth of our students. We believe learning comes from making connections betwee
n 
ourselves, our community, and the world beyond. We believe citizens are created by practicing responsible stewardship 
of ourselves, our community and our world. We believe that to be a learning community means to believe that learners 
are more than the s
um of all of their parts, they are a part of an interconnected system comprised of their environment, 
creating the whole child.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Northside STEAM School was built in the 1950s when there were about 200 students in attendance. In 
1982, a 
multipurpose building was constructed, which included a stage, kitchen, classroom and office facilities. Since then, a grade 
6
-
8 wing was added. Additional relocatable buildings were added in 1988 to house the increased population that had 
reached 
720 by September 1992. In 1995, Northside STEAM School completed an expansion project that included a new 
library and administration wing, six classrooms and two PE changing rooms. Modernization funds were used during the 
summer of 2001 to upgrade that por
tion of the facilities built in the 1950s. New heating, air
-
conditioning, bathrooms and 
computer connectivity were added. Landscaping improvements and facility upgrades keep the school fresh and appealing.
 
The site and district custodial staff maintain all
 
buildings on a regular basis; safety is a top priority. The custodial and 
maintenance staff consists of one custodian who provides services during the school hours, one custodian who works 
during evening hours and one grounds maintenance person.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
o
f study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We emphasize providing a safe environment for our students and regularly conduct safety inspections of our campus with 
site and district maintenance. A continuous monitoring of potential safety concerns are evaluated at monthly staff 
meetings. We
 
conduct s
ystematic evacuation and emergency drills on a monthly basis. The local fire department, emergency medical 
technicians and ambulance service are in close proximity to our school and provide immediate
 
response. Our school has a closed campus, which allows f
or a well
-
supervised environment.  More detailed information 
on our safety
 
and evacuation procedures is in our school safety plan. The school safety plan was last reviewed, updated and
 
discussed with the school faculty in October 2019.
