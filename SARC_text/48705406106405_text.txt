serve
 
every

The
 
District
 
takes
 
great
 
efforts
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
all
 
schools
 
are
 
clean,
 
safe,
 
and
 
functional
 
for
 
our
 
high
 
educational
 
standards.
  
This
 
is
 
achieved
 
by
 
custodial
 
staff
 
adhering
 
to
 
district-wide
 
cleaning
 
standards.
  
In
 
addition,
 
a
 
work
 
order
 
process
 
was
 
developed
 
to
 
make
 
certain
 
that
 
timely
 
and
 
effective
 
maintenance
 
service
 
is
 
provided
 
and
 
that
 
emergency
 
repairs
 
are
 
given
 
the
 
highest
 
priority.
 
 
The
 
voters
 
of
 
the
 
community
 
approved
 
a
 
$249
 
million
 
General
 
Obligation
 
Bond
 
to
 
provide
 
facility
 
upgrades
 
and
 
improvements.
 
$9
 
million
 
has
 
been
 
allocated
 
to
 
modernize
 
the
 
campus,
 
which
 
will
 
include
 
a
 
new
 
performing
 
arts
 
building.
  
The
 
project
 
also
 
includes
 
work
 
that
 
was
 
completed
 
in
 
summer
 
2019,
 
installing

(School

2019-20)
 
 
A
 
strong
 
and
 
supportive
 
PTA
 
is
 
a
 
key
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
enrichment
 
program
 
at
 
Oakbrook,
 
from
 
assemblies
 
to
 
activities.
  
Parents,
 
grandparents,
 
aunts
 
and
 
other
 
treasured
 
volunteers
 
participate
 
by
 
working
 
directly
 
in
 
the
 
rooms
 
at
 
each
 
grade
 
level,
 
helping
 
from
 
home,
 
working
 
lunch
 
duty
 
and
 
before-school
 
duty
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
providing
 
classroom
 
support.
   
Each
 
year
 
brings
 
a
 
new
 
group
 
of
 
parents
 
in
 
as
 
well,
 
and
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
pleasure
 
to
 
build
 
this
 
partnership.
  
Parents
 
and
 
community
 
members
 
also
 
support
 
school
 
programs
 
through
 
events
 
like
 
the
 
Dancing
 
with
 
the
 
Dolphins
 
annual
 
Gala.
   
Other

include:
 
thematic

and,

Parents
 
are
 
considered
 
partners
 
and
 
support
 
the
 
school
 
artistically
 
and
 
academically.
 
In

parents
 
have

Plan
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
The
 
Fairfield-Suisun
 
Unified
 
School
 
District
 
requires
 
safety
 
plans
 
for
 
each
 
school:
 
BP/AR
 
0450,
 
Comprehensive
 
Safety
 
Plan;
 
BP3515,
 
Campus
 
Security;
 
BP/AR
 
3515.2,
 
Disruptions;
 
and
 
BP/AR
 
3516,
 
Disaster
 
Regulations.
 
The
 
Governing
 
Board
 
insists
 
that
 
students
 
and
 
staff
 
have
 
the
 
right
 
to
 
a
 
safe
 
and
 
secure
 
campus
 
where
 
they
 
are
 
free
 
from
 
physical
 
and
 
psychological
 
harm.
 
The
 
Board
 
is
 
fully
 
committed
 
to
 
maximizing
 
school
 
safety
 
and
 
to
 
creating
 
a
 
positive
 
learning
 
environment
 
that
 
teaches
 
violence
 
prevention
 
and
 
emphasizes
 
high
 
expectations
 
for
 
student
 
achievement,
 
responsible
 
behavior
 
and
 
respect
 
for
 
others.
 
Each
 
school
 
site
 
develops
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
school
 
wide
 
safety
 
plan
 
that
 
includes
 
violence
 
prevention
 
strategies
 
and
 
actions
 
to
 
be
 
taken
 
in
 
the
 
event
 
of
 
a
 
crisis.
 
Each
 
plan
 
is
 
tailored
 
to
 
the
 
specific
 
conditions
 
at
 
the
 
school.
 
Each
 
school
 
plan
 
takes
 
into
 
account
 
the
 
expertise,
 
available
 
resources
 
and
 
building
 
design,
 
along
 
with
 
factors
 
unique
 
to
 
each
 
site.
 
A
 
copy
 
of
 
the
 
school's
 
plan
 
is
 
available
 
at
 
the
 
school.
 
The
 
plan
 
is
 
updated
 
and
 
reviewed
 
at
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
each
 
school
 
year
 
by
 
the
 
principal
 
with
 
the
 
complete
 
faculty.
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plans
 
include
 
the
 
following
 
elements:
 
a
 
positive
 
school
 
climate
 
promoting
 
respect
 
for
 
diversity,
 
personal
 
and
 
social
 
responsibility,
 
effective
 
interpersonal
 
and
 
communication
 
skills,
 
anger
 
management
 
and
 
conflict
 
resolution;
 
disciplinary
 
policies
 
and
 
procedures;
 
prevention
 
of
 
and
 
alternatives
 
to
 
violence;
 
parent
 
involvement
 
strategies;
 
prevention
 
and
 
intervention
 
strategies
 
related
 
to
 
the
 
sale
 
or
 
use
 
of
 
alcohol
 
and
 
drugs;
 
assessment
 
of
 
the
 
school's
 
physical
 
environment
 
and
 
development
 
of
 
ground
 
security;
 
school-site
 
crisis
 
intervention
 
strategies;
 
staff
 
training
 
in
 
violence
 
prevention
 
and
 
intervention
 
techniques.
 
 
As
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plan,
 
Oakbrook's
 
positive
 
support
 
includes
 
parent-positive
 
contact
 
through
 
Dolphin
 
PROUD:
 
Polite,
 
Respectful,
 
Owning
 
their
 
own
 
actions,
 
United
 
and
 
Determined
 
to
 
succeed.
 
Students
 
who
 
are
 
recognized
 
throughout
 
the
 
day
 
for
 
displaying
 
these
 
qualities
 
will
 
receive
 
a
 
PROUD
 
card.
 
When
 
students
 
accumulate
 
five
 
PROUD
 
cards,
 
they
 
get
 
a
 
certificate
 
from
 
the
 
office
 
and
 
a
 
prize.
 
Oakbrook
 
also
 
has
 
a
 
Dynamic
 
Dolphin
 
award
 
available
 
on
 
a
 
weekly
 
basis
 
to
 
recognize
 
PROUD
 
behaviors,
 
academic
 
achievement,
 
and
 
exceptional
 
attendance.
 
These
 
awards
 
are
 
ﬁteacher™s
 
choiceﬂ
 
and
 
can
 
be
 
granted
 
for
 
many
 
varieties
 
of
 
student
 
success.
 
Students
 
are
 
also
 
given
 
Effort
 
Awards
 
when
 
they
 
demonstrate
 
grit
 
and
 
determination.
 
Assemblies,
 
day
 
events,
 
and
 
leadership
 
opportunities
 
are
 
used
 
to
 
build
 
school
 
spirit
 
and
 
enhance
 
involvement.
 
 
Students
 
practice
 
emergency
 
procedures
 
like
 
fire
 
and
 
earthquake
 
drills,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
actions
 
to
 
take
 
when
 
approached
 
by
 
a
 
stranger.
 
Each
 
practice
 
has
 
its
 
own
 
plan
 
for
 
shelter/escape
 
behaviors.
 
As
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
several
 
staff
 
members
 
attending
 
the
 
Solano
 
County
 
Safety
 
Symposium
 
on
 
October
 
9,
 
escape
 
procedures
 
have
 
been
 
revised.
 
The
 
most
 
recent
 
discussion
 
and

was
 
on
 
October
 
23,
 
2019
 
that
