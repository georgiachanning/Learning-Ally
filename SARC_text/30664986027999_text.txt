By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The mission of William T. Newland Elementary School is to provide an educational environment in which academic success 
is expected and all children are encouraged to develop to their maximum potential through a positive attitude tow
ard self 
and others, a love of learning, an appreciation for diversity in others, and the cultivation of the ability to be a productiv
e, 
useful member of society.
 
 
Our staff is dedicated to maintaining and enhancing the spirit of excellence that pervades o
ur school and community.  All 
of Newland's teachers teach to the California State Standards, challenging each student to reach his maximum potential.  
Teachers strive to help students demonstrate mastery on the Smarter Balanced Assessments.  The following 
special 
programs help students achieve their highest potential: Speech and Language, Resource Specialist Program, Gifted and 
Talented Program, Remediation, Special Day Classes, and Social Skills Classes.  The education program is also enhanced 
through comm
unity involvement utilizing our hardworking and supportive parents and business partners. Parents and 
teachers conduct ongoing assessments of the school
-
based program.  Our standards based program utilizes hands
-
on 
activities, manipulatives, group projects
, portfolios, District Interim Assessments, and unit tests provided by the adopted 
publishers. The Newland staff continues to develop professionally in order to provide high quality instruction. Teachers 
continue to use the media center and other technolog
y to make learning accessible and enticing for students.  Finally, 
Newland provides a nurturing caring environment that encourages the celebration and joy of learning. The school 
environment is clean, orderly, and a place where all students feel safe and s
ecure.
 
 
Newland has a history of rich academic excellence.  Newland has been named a California Distinguished School, a 
California Gold Ribbon School, and a National Blue Ribbon School.  Newland Elementary is fortunate to have 29 certified 
Teachers, Speech
 
and Language Pathologists and Psychologists who are dedicated to the education of our students; many 
of who hold advanced degrees in education or their areas of expertise.  Staff participate in rigorous professional 
development designed to equip teachers 
with high
-
impact, researched based teaching strategies to bring out the best in 
students.  Newland's number one goal is to focus on increasing student achievement through an academic student
-

instructional program, while at the same time providing a h
ighly enriched educational and social environment for 
elementary students.  Newland students benefit from outstanding classroom instruction in all areas and a dedicated team 
of educational specialists including Resource Specialists, four Special Day Classe
s, three Speech and Language Pathologists, 
and two School Psychologists providing the support needed to help students with special needs achieve their full potential.
 
 
Newland is the intake center for the District's PB5 (Parent Birth to five years) program
. Students are referred for testing 
by Regional Center and parents or doctors when there is a suspected developmental delay.  One or all of the following 
professionals administer the appropriate testing: the occupational therapist, classroom teacher, psych
ologist, speech and 
language pathologist, adaptive Physical Education specialist, and/or nurse.  The team meets monthly to determine 
appropriate placement and level of services.  Newland houses a special day pre
-
school class, a blended pre
-
school class, 
so
cial skills groups, occupational therapy and adaptive physical education.  These programs provide services for children 
with identified needs between the ages of three and five.  In addition to servicing the Special Day Class population, 
Resource Specialis
ts and Speech and Language pathologists are also provided for the transitional kindergarten through 
fifth grade students that require additional support in the classroom.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Newland Elementary School was originally constructed in the 1960s and has been thoroughly modernized over the last 
several years. The campus is currently comprised of 23 permanent classrooms, 6 portable classrooms, a library, a staff 
lounge, and a spacious
 
playground. The facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample classroom and 
recreational space.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 

rd 
of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the District. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a 
daily basis throughout the school year with an emphasis on classrooms and restrooms. A joint effort between students 
and staff help
s keep the campus clean and litter
-

sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair:
 
A routine maintenance program is adm

complex maintenance functions occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is 
administered by Fountain Valley School District's Maintenance 
& Operations Department to ensure that school grounds 
and facilities remain in excellent repair. A work order process is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. 
Emergency repairs are given the highest priority; repair requests are complete
d efficiently and in the order in which they 
are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
Deferred maintenance includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. Fountain Valley Schoo
l District did not participate in the State School Deferred Maintenance 
Budget Program. Fountain Valley School District sets aside funds each year to specifically address deferred maintenance 
needs. The passing of Measure O provided additional, much
-
needed
 
funds for these types of projects.  Newland is 
scheduled to go through remodernization begining in the Spring of 2021.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Newland School. Students are supervised before/after school, 
during lunch and recess periods, by teachers, administrators, trained aides, and classified sta
ff. All visitors to the campus 

their stay on school grounds.
 
 
The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pert
aining to hazardous materials and State earthquake 
standards. The Safety Committee reviews and updates the Safe School Action Plan each year by March 1st. Any and all 
revisions to the plan are immediately communicated to classified and certificated staff.
 
 
The Goals and Objectives in the Safe School Action Plan focus on three areas:
 
1)
 
School climate characterized by caring and connectedness,
 
2)
 
Safe and orderly physical environment of the school, and
 
3)
 
The health and wellness of students.
 
 
To supplement the 
Safe School Action Plan, every school also has a disaster preparedness plan that includes steps for 
ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire, disaster, and lockdown drills are conducted on a rotating basis 
throughout the school year.  Newl
and staff participated in professional development related to safety during the 2019
-
20 
school year.

Staff development is a priority in the Fountain Valley School District.  We value the impact highly skilled instructors have 
on student achievement. Three days are reserved specifically for this purpose for all employees in FVSD, and an additional 
three da
ys are reserved specifically for professional development related to supporting ELA, Math, and Science.  During 
the school year, there are numerous other opportunities for teachers to teachers attend training either before, during, or 
after the school day.
  
Throughout the District, there are both school level and district
-
wide initiatives.  Recent training 
initiatives in Fountain Valley School District and Newland Elementary School include:
 
 

 
Lucy Culkins Units of Study Reading
 

 
Cognitively Guided 
Instruction (CGI) in Math
 

 
Fountas & Pinnell Reading Assessments & Intervention Kits

In addition to identified days within the school year calendar, Newland has also 
taken steps to increase the number of 
opportunities teachers have to collaborate with each other.  For site
-
specific professional development opportunities, 
these have been determined by Newland Leadership Team input and principal decisions.  Since teacher
s often learn in 
group settings, there are also opportunities for mentoring and small group follow
-
up supports as well.  Teachers are 
supported in multiple ways, including principal
-
teacher meetings, peer coaching, use of FVSD TOSA personnel, along with 
da
ta analysis.  All are used to plan and drive instruction.  Specifically at Newland, we have partnered with a leading expert 
in the field of Reader's Workshop to provide in
-
depth training and development in the area of reading, centered around 
Balanced Lite
racy throughout 2019
-
2020.
