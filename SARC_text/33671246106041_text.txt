About the SARC
 
By Februa
ry 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fundin
g Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state an
d local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the scho
ol, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Smart
er Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

and provides a wide variety of opportunities for direct parent and comm
unity participation.
 
 
The School Site Council (SSC) works immensely hard in recommending and developing the school plan and approving programs and 
spending. They review 
school programs annually. The English Learner Advisory Council (ELAC) is very willing t
o provide input on matters that affect students who receive English 
Language Development.  The African American Parent Advisory Council (AAPAC) works to ensure that the needs of African America
n students are met, 
and provides input about culturally relevan
t issues and programs, especially focusing on resources that address under
-
served populations.
 
 
Our ASB Club enriches the quality of the school climate by coordinating school spirit activities such as,"FALL  Festival" as 
well as numerous fundraisers 
throug
hout the year. Volunteers are actively encouraged to assist in the classrooms, help during field trips, and support teachers 
with special projects.  
ASB has also been successful in creating weekly video announcements which highlight school and community ev
ents, celebrate historical and societal 
events, and is done completely by our ASB students under the guidance of ASB advisors.  These video announcements are made av
ailable to parents 
upon request to protect the privacy of our students and staff.
 
 
In addit
ion, our parents have organized a weekly BOOK CLUB where self improvement literature is applied and analyzed.  Authors have p
articipated in 
the the meeting and have been instrumental in engaging and encouraging parents to continue their love for literacy.
 
 
The County of San Bernardino further enhances parental involvement through a program entitled, "Strengthening Families".  Fam
ilies sign up for sessions 
in which they are provided with a dinner meal for the whole family, they break up into groups, and pare
nts are equipped with tools to apply at home.
 
 
Another parent involvement opportunity has to do with, "Parenting With Dignity".  This program provides parents with skills t
o use at home with all their 
children.  It includes modules from The Drew Bledsoe Fo
undation, and the premise of the 9 week course is that our children will make all the final and 
hard decisions in their lives, therefore the ideas in our children's mind will rule their world.

fourth, and fifth grade students.
 
 
Serrano participated in the "Million Father March" for the first time this year which promotes the participation of our fathe

though all parents are able 
to participate.  Serrano works with other elementary schools from time to time to promote networking opportunities for our pa
rents and to disseminate 
information.
 
 
Throughout the school year the parents attend Parent Workshops, 
Family Literacy / Math Nights, etc. enjoying instruction in curricular areas to develop 
skills they can use at home. Community involvement is further evidenced by support from organizations that help highlight our
 
academic programs with 
recognition incenti
ves.
