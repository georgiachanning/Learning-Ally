About the SARC
 
By February
 
1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding 
Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and 
local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the 
school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The district instructional material evaluation committee, consisted of members representing teachers
, administrators, other staff, students, 
parents/guardians, and community, ensures that the selected textbooks, technology
-
based materials and other educational materials effectively support 
the district's adopted courses of study and meet current curricul
ar goals and California Content Standards. Teachers, students, parents/guardians and 
community members have the opportunity to review and provide input about the instructional materials being considered for ado
ption. 
Recommendations for the adoption and/or
 
withdrawal of instructional materials by the instructional material evaluation committee are presented to 
the Board by the Superintendent or designee and include documentation supporting the recommendation. In some instances, the c
onsidered textbooks 
and/
or instructional materials are piloted for a period of time before being recommended for adoption to the Board of Education.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Tahoe has an active PTA and invites families to become an integral part of the instructional and supplementary programs at Ta

teachers and students through fun

raising and volunteerism. PTA Board Meetings are on the first Wednesday of each month at 5: 30.  Parents support 
the school in many ways such as working at events (BTS Barbecue, Movie Nights,  Pancake Breakfast, Fall Festival, Jog a Thon,
 
and the Book Fa
ir), 
chaperoning on field trips, volunteering as an Art Docent or Garden Docent,  assisting in the classroom, or sitting on adviso
ry/school governance 
committees. Parents are participants in our School Site Council and English Learner Advisory Committee an
d help the school formulate goals for 
continuous improvement around student achievement as well as provide input for school fiscal matters.  School advisory groups
 
meet on the 4th 
Thursday of every month at 4:30 PM. Parents and community members are also e
ncouraged to participate in the school Safety Committee.  Additionally,  
opportunities for parenting classes occur each year as well as parent engagement nights which support parents in having fun w
hile learning alongside 
their student.    Finally, neighbo
rhood and community organizations are closely linked to the school and provide multiple support services.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators 
and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including
 
ELA Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Linguistically Relevant Teaching and 
Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through thi
s program deeply align with the needs of our individual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and connect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional in
structional practices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson
 
design.

Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outside of contracted hours. In addition to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunit
y for teachers to engage in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening their content knowledge, strengthening their instruct
ional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of 
responsibility.
