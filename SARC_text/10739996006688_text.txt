A Message from the Principal:
 
Welcome to Kerman
-
Floyd Elementary's School Accountability Report Card. As you read this report, 
I believe you will find that what emerges is a picture of a school with a commitment to excellence, 
a 
faculty that is professionally skilled and personally committed to meeting the learning needs of 
all students, and a student body that as a whole, is well disciplined and motivated. Our school 
community has a great amount of pride and works as a family. Th
e school staff welcomes parent 
and community participation and strives to create a partnership between parents, students, and 
the school. Parents are welcome to visit or work in the classrooms and are highly encouraged to 
take part in their children's educ
ational process.
 
 
With a large number (57 percent) of English Language Learners (ELL), Kerman
-
Floyd is proud to 
provide an ELL program that ensures success. We have been able to progress as a school and have 
shown great progress on the ELPAC (a Language De
velopment Test for English Learners). During 
the Spring our 3rd 
-
 
6th grade students took the  SBAC Standards Based Testing online.
 
 
Major Achievements:
 
The focus of the staff this past year was to improve the delivery of instruction to our students and 
to
 
implement effective, research based curriculum to our students. Many intervention programs 
were implemented and targeted instruction was given to students. The teachers have attended and 
implemented curriculum with State Standards and new NGSS Standards w
ith support from the 
Fresno County Superintendent of Schools with great success.
 
 
For the past few years staff development was focused on the RTI (Response to Intervention) model 
to meet the needs of our students. The staff was able to better identify need
s of students and 
determine a plan of action to monitor their progress and make the best use of resources for every 
student.
 
 
We will continue to focus on EL students, using the strategies for which the staff received training, 
building on ways to help the
se students who are having difficulty in reading. We will continue to 
offer research based interventions during the school day as well as target instruction in the 
classrooms to meet their needs. We will continue to use the RTI (Response to Intervention ) 
model 
to identify students at risk and fit them into an intervention program that will specifically service 
their deficiencies. We will continue to increase the use of technology in the classrooms to give 
students better access to the skills they need. We 
have also implemented the PBIS Process (Positive 
Behavioral Interventions) and Supports with great success. We have increased our attendance and 
decreased our suspensions and office referrals as a result of the implementation.  We have also 
purchased sever
al mobile computer labs for the classrooms and have a cart in every 1st 
-
 
6th grade 
classroom.  We have also added Topcat classroom audio system to the entire school. Every teacher 
has a SMARTboard, projector, laptop and document camera in their classrooms
 
as well as a teacher 
designated iPad. We will also focus on technology for teachers so that they are better able to 
analyze standardized tests and benchmark tests to determine the needs of each student. We will 
also focus on science this year with trainin
g provided by FCSS PD.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Types of Services Funded
 
Kerman
-
Floyd receives federal Title I funding that provides high
-
quality 
opportunities for students in high
-
poverty schools 
to meet district and 
state content and performance standards. These funds are intended to 
provide services for students who are at risk of failing to meet state and 
district standards in Reading, Language Arts, and/or Mathematics. Services 
are to supplemen
t the core curriculum program by providing increased 
instructional time, more intense instruction (individually or in small 
groups), and/or a different type of program using specially selected 
materials and/or instructional techniques. The intention of the
 
program is 
to help students become successful (achieve grade level) in the core 
curriculum areas of reading, language arts, and mathematics. The Title I 
program requires parent participation and supports coordination with 
other programs that provide fundi
ng for specific purposes.
 
 
We receive Title III from federal to provide supplementary services for 
English Learners. The general purpose is to develop fluency in English as 
effectively and efficiently as possible, to provide equal opportunity for 
academic 
achievement, to promote positive self
-
concepts, and to promote 
cross
-
cultural understanding. Funds are allocated based on the number of 
English Learners in the school.
 
 
Kerman
-
Floyd also received LCFF (Local Control Facilities Funds) money 
from the state t
o provide materials and services to assist all students to 
achieve academic success. The process for using this budget is to assess 
the needs by data, staff, and parents. We have focused on adding to 
technology as well as bilingual tutors and a Computer Te
ch. We have also 
purchased supplemental materials to assist with the teaching of the State 
Standards. We have also contracted for teacher training and professional 
development for the staff.

Quality, Currency, 
Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

Kerman
-
Floyd sets a high priority upon ensuring that there are sufficient textbooks and materials to support the school educational 
program. Textbook 
selection is done by the Distr
ict, grade level, and subject area committees coordinated by Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services. All texts must
 
be aopted from the most recent approved State matrices or local governing board approved lists. Textbook purchases are consis
tent 
with the content 
cycles of the California Curriculum Frameworks as District IMF and other funding sources permit.
 
 
Categorical funding also allows us to purchase supplementary instructional materials for English Learners in kindergarten to 
fourth grades to
 
accelerate 
pupils as rapidly as possible towards grade level proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking. These materials are used in 
addition to the basic 
Reading/Language Arts and other core materials provided for every student and are correlated to S
tate Standards
-
aligned textbooks each year with new 
adoption cycles per core area.

School Facility Conditions and Pl
anned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Kerman Floyd Elementary School was built in 1952. The irrigation system has been serviced and repaired to meet the water capa
city needed. The 
kindergarten playground has had several worn playground equipment replaced 
with new equipment and wood chips have been replaced to bring the 
area up to code.
 
During the 2009
-
10 school year the 45 year old building that was used as the library was torn down due to
 
the deteriorated
 
condition of the structure. A 
new building is now 
situated on the same site.
 
 
 
Kerman
-
Floyd Elementary was selected for the last four years for an On
-
site Williams Visit by Fresno County. During these yearly inspections, only minor 
repairs were recommended. At this time, all repairs to the school have bee
n made. The school repaired the roofs of two classroom wings and the office. 
A pavement and shade structure will be added to the kindergarten play area as well.

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information 
about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports 
for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are 
publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet 
at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, 
the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending on 
availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation,

Professional development has become part of the daily work life of the 
Kerman Unified teaching teams. Teachers, administrators and support 
staff participate in workshops and seminars, coach one another, plan 
lessons together along with our Literacy Coaches
, and collaborate for the 
purpose of student achievement. The professional learning community 
understands that teachers need collaboration time with one another. As a 
result, there is much support for providing the time and resources teachers 
require for t
he purpose of changing their practice. Teachers are afforded 
opportunities to participate in curriculum development, learn and share 
successful methods of reaching students, discuss comprehensive and 
efficient ways to implement standards, and continue thei
r own learning. 
The district and the school site provide professional development days for 
staff.  These days are devoted to curriculum training, discussing 
achievement data, and grade level collaboration.  Staff also have the 
opportunity to attend out of 
district conferences to enhance their skills as 
educators.

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

of the School Site Council, 
English Learner Advisory Committee, and Parent Teacher Club. Kerman

School Safety Plan
 
Kerman
-
Floyd provides a safe, secure environment for learning. We have a School Safety Plan on f
ile and available to all parents as well as the general 
public. The staff develops the plan with input from parents and community members to ensure a safe and nonviolent environment
. Specific areas of 
focus coupled with appropriate strategies are featured 
in our School Plan. We review and update the School Plan during our School Site Council meeting 
on November 26, 2019. Key elements of the plan include monthly safety drills and crisis intervention plans.
 
 
Staff monitors the school grounds for 20 minutes be
fore and after school as well as at all recesses and at lunch time. Teachers regularly review the rules 
for safe, responsible behavior in school and on the playground. The principal includes safety behavior issues with the studen
ts each morning during 
morn
ing announcements and discusses choices with the students. We have a closed campus that is fully fenced. Visitors must enter 
the school through 
the main door and sign in at the office, where they receive a badge to wear throughout their stay. Safety drills
 
occur once a month and are reported to 
the district office. The school has a safety inspection team that monitors the facilities once each quarter to maintain a saf
e environment.
