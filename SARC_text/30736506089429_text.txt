By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Culverdale is a K
-
6 elementary school of 33 teachers and a fluid range of 670
-
750 students located in Irvine, Califor
nia.  
Our attendance area has over 2600 apartment units (29% are affordable housing), and approximately 25% of our first 
through sixth grade students are new to our school each year.  The percentage of students who qualify for free or reduced 
lunch is 41%.
  
Culverdale has a rich ethnic and multi
-
cultural background.  Over 200 of our students were born in another 
country and over 43% are identified as English Language Learners. We are a wonderfully unique school as 32 languages 
are spoken and no one ethnicit
y represents more than 20% of our school.  We house 4 English Language Development 
Newcomer classes K
-
6 for students who are new to the United States and score Beginning on their initial ELPAC test, and 
in recent years we have added 4 self
-
contained specia
l education classes TK
-
6.
 
 
Our mission is to enable our students to become respectful, responsible, self
-
reliant problem
-
solvers who can assume a 
productive role in a diverse world. With the combination of a rigorous academic program, dedicated teachers an
d staff, 
and a nurturing educational environment, we strive to help each student recognize his/her potential and experience the 
joy of learning.  We differentiate curriculum and provide interventions for students performing below and challenges for 
those p
erforming above grade level proficiency.  All students find success and growth at Culverdale School.  See below for 
the formal Mission Statement of Culverdale Elementary (revised 8/16/2018).
 
 
Our most important goal is to create a safe climate where childr
en feel secure and comfortable.  Culverdale has focused 
on a positive behavior and support program to provide students and staff with clear behavioral expectations that lead to 
a pro
-


looks like to behave in this fashion in the different areas around campus.  Students are positively recognized for behaving 
the taught/expected way, and they are held accountable when they do not.  We celebrate the
ir successes daily with Cool 
Koala incentives and quarterly during our awards ceremonies.  Lunchtime sports leagues have been in place for all students 
grades 1
-
6 to participate daily as part of our PBIS program.  Every week, a team of 6th grade students c
onsider school 
news items to film student
-
based segments and then edit the videos together to create our 4
-
7 minute (Koala News 
Network) KNN episodes.  These episodes are shown in every classroom each Monday morning.  This aims to build TK

community amon

community to support our path to cultural proficiency.  Our annual PTA Culture Day provides parents with the opportunity 
to highlight characteristics of their country an
d culture by sharing food, artifacts, and costumes while providing students 

strengthen their understanding of our diverse community.

Our s
taff has adjusted to our changing student population by implementing both Professional Learning Communities and 
Response to Intervention strategies.  Our goal, with every decision we make, is to provide the best educational experience 
that we can envision.
  
This starts with a very systematic process of identifying which students are ready for grade
-
level 
curriculum and which are not.  Based on our universal screening assessments, teachers work together with their grade 
level colleagues to create flexible an
d fluid groups.  The teachers then provide instruction directly targeted at helping 
these specific groups of students.  We utilize instructional assistants to reduce the student
-
to
-
adult ratio across the grade 
level, and allocate a portion of our Title I f
unds to provide a reading specialist for students with significant needs.  Since 
the 2017
-
2018 school year, we've utilized District Funds and Title 1 School Funds to staff a 5
-
day/week Elementary 
Resource Counselor.
 
 
Culverdale students have opportunities 
to participate in a variety of activities to build leadership and showcase their 
talents.  Our student leadership group participates in a Team Kids Challenge each year, plans spirit days each month, helps 
organize a canned food drive and holiday toy drive,
 
and sponsors an student
-
selected organization each year.  Our 
students have the opportunity to participate in Irvine Junior Games, Harvest Cup Soccer tournament, Winter Boal Flag 
Football tournament, and Irvine Youth Basketball Classic.  Building the capa
city to be a leader both academically and 
socially helps to build the whole child.
 
 

parents and staff we will continue striving to provid
e all children with everything they need to be successful both now and 
in the future.
 
 
Our Mission Statement was revised by site administrators and all certificated staff on August 16, 2018.
 
 
Our Vision:
 
WHERE WE'RE GOING
 
 
A commitment to excellence is the
 
hallmark of Culverdale Elementary. As a school and community partnership, our 
promise is to provide the highest quality educational experience we can envision. To that end, we are dedicated to:

a celebration of diversity,
 

 
and
 
a growth mindset en route to lifelong learning.
 
 
Our Mission:
 
HOW WE'LL GET THERE
 
 
We will leverage our collective resources in order to make a positive global impact by:
 
 

 
building relationships to engage all learners,
 

 
nurturing the diverse gifts, multipl
e learning styles, and full capabilities of each individual,
 

 
fostering social and emotional wellness,
 

 
developing competent, resourceful, resilient, and empowered learners who are prepared to meet the challenges 
of a complex future,
 

 
challenging every studen
t to persevere for personal excellence,
 

 
enhancing our students' capacity for courage, compassion, and collaboration,
 

 
implementing the latest technology in all students' learning,
 

 
and providing a safe, conducive environment for academic risk
-

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Culverdale Elementary
 
School was established in 1974 as one of the first elementary schools in Irvine. The building was 
modernized during the summer of 2006.  The new facilities offer students a technology
-
rich environment in which to learn 
each day.  In addition, there are po
rtable classrooms on campus to serve our growing student population and special 
programs like the English Language Development (ELD) program. The Irvine Unified School District is committed to 
maintaining the facility both in appearance and in function.
 
 
D
uring the spring of 2019, the sound system was replaced with a modern, intuitive Bluetooth system in the multi
-
purpose 
room (MPR) to allow easy usage for any staff member or PTA parent.  Current site projects include a new kindergarten 
playground structure
, climbing wall, funnel ball hoop, and expanded fall zone.  This is anticipated to be completed in 
summer 2020.  To update the exterior of the school, the light
-
umber, metal roof needs attention to make the color 
uniform.  Also, white paint (swiss coffee) 
will be done on all horizontal beams to provide an accent which also matches 
the HOA of the surrounding neighborhood.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the
 
State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education populat
ion and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are alig
ned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the r
equirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Culverdale School offers 
families a variety of ways to become involved.  Parents are educated through email distribution 
lists on their opportunities to participate in each year's Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP). Formal meetings are 
scheduled, posted, and convened during 
each school year to discuss the LCAP and allow parents to vote on potential 
actions for the upcoming year(s).  The PTA and our Title 1 staff team sponsor book fairs, family nights, and other 
fundraisers to support our school.  The School Site Council and E
nglish Learner Advisory Committee provide opportunities 
for parents to work with staff to develop programs and to monitor the progress of school goals.  All parents are invited to 
participate, and a formal election of parents on the SSC/ELAC is conducted t
hrough the parent email distribution list.  
Classroom teachers also provide opportunities for parents to volunteer in the classroom setting.  We encourage and 
appreciate the many volunteer hours that we receive from our families and business community.  Pa
rents who are 
interested in volunteering may visit out Culverdale PTA website at www.culverdalepta.com.

School Safety Plan (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Ensuring a safe environment for our children is the number one priority at Culverdale School; therefore, we have 
developed a comprehensive Safe School Plan. Our plan is evaluated annually and amended, as needed by the School Site 
Council an
d by the key leaders of the Safety Committee.  Earthquake and disaster preparedness is an ongoing emphasis 
at Culverdale.  Rotating monthly response drills for fire, earthquake, and lockdown are scheduled and implemented 
throughout the school year to asses
s our level of preparedness. Emergency supplies have been purchased and stored for 
a potential disaster. These emergency supplies are kept in our Emergency Storage Shed for immediate access if needed. 
Our school is fully prepared to deal with a major emerg
ency and to provide for the physical and emotional needs of the 
students and their orderly and safe release, and we review with all staff each October for the Great California Shakeout. 
We schedule regular drills to teach children appropriate safety action
s in the event of an emergency. A lockdown 
procedure has been established to protect students and staff from intruders.  We also have the ability to reach all parents 
with an automated phone message system and email system. In September of 2018, numerous e
lectric
-
access door panels 
and cameras were installed strategically around campus.  These CCTV cameras are accessible by site administrators, 
district security, and Irvine Police Department.  In the spring of 2020, more cameras will be installed based on n
eed
-
to
-
reduce blind spots on campus.
 
 
The school has adopted an Anti
-
Bullying Policy as part of our Koala Pride Program which was developed using the Positive 
Behavior Intervention System (PBIS) model.  Supervision is provided on the playground before and 
after school. Based on 
2018
-
2019 School Site Council feedback, the lunchtime staffing has been increased to help prevent unkind or unsafe 
choices by students during their break times.  There are specific procedures and rules governing bicycles for those st
udents 
in grades 3 or older who ride to school. There are also procedures in place to administer medication during the school day 
for children.  Parents are reminded periodically though principal email newsletters that parking lot driving rules are in 
plac
e to account for the many young children on campus.  Parents are also reminded that students are not permitted to 
play on the playground equipment before school or until after 4:00pm.  Clip art graphics are used in these newsletters to 
catch the attention 
of the numerous English as a Second Language parents in our community.  For mental health 
awareness/supports, IUSD schools continue the campaign called Speak Up, We Care.  Students, parents, and staff are 
given encouragement and clear instructions of how t
o talk to a staff member when there is a concern.  Principal 
newsletters and a highly
-
visible, campus sign are in place to remind parents of the resources.

place of more than 40 specific funding categories, the new model has established three sources of state 
funding with 
increased local discretion to determine how best to spend those funds in the service of students.  All districts receive a 
BASE of per
-
student funding that varies slightly depending on grade level.  All districts also receive SUPPLEMENTAL 
fund
ing.  IUSD has used BASE and SUPPLEMENTAL funding to support the following programs:
 
 
Site Programs and Services:  1) Support professional learning and teacher coaching through induction program, content 
TOSAs and teacher mentor program , 2) provide summer
 
school and summer athletic programs, 3) Allocating site funding 
and staffing to support student achievement through support of Professional Learning Communities (PLC) and site PLC 
coaches, 4) Elementary P.E. paraprofessionals, 5) Support for English langu
age learners, 6) Elementary science, music, and 
art programs, 7) Purchase textbooks and instructional materials, 8) Develop a technology rich learning environment 
including; Technology matching programs, Technology Maintenance fund and site technology supp
ort staff, 9) Maintain

The Culverdale Staff strives for continuous improvement and 
evaluation of our programs.  Therefore, we believe that 
targeted staff development activities are essential for maintaining and improving quality education.  Teachers agreed to 
2 full day Professional Development day before the school year contract began (
waiver days).  Staff development for the 
2019
-
2020 school year focuses on Social Emotional Learning, our newly
-
implemented Step Up to Writing program, and 
Professional Learning Communities. For August 14, a District TOSA and the principal developed a staff
 
development that 
targets the current needs and supports at Culverdale School.  The topics of Restorative Practices, SEL, PBIS, and Calm 
Classroom were spiraled through a six
-
hour PD day.  On August 15, the morning's 3 hours focused on introducing the new 
Step Up to Writing program and PLC team's identifying essential areas for TK
-
6th grade continuity 
-
 
based on our site's 
committee work done in early July.   That afternoon's 3 hours were dedicated to teachers collaborating and unbundling 
the components of 
the Step Up to Writing program.
 
 
All teachers also attend 2 full
-
day PD days hosted by the District and 1 full
-
day on
-
site PD Day.  The site PD day focused on 
Personal Connections and PLC work toward Step Up to Writing after 7 weeks using the new program. 
The principal 
presented an interactive 3
-
hour workshop that helped teachers understand their own personality (Keirsey), based on 
strengths, tendencies, and areas to be mindful of.  Teachers worked in PLC teams to understand how a team member's 
personality 
impacts a team relationship.  Teachers also learned about learning and communication styles of different 
generations from Baby Boomers, Gen X, Millenials, and Digital Citizens.  Teachers work with each other and colleagues 
from other schools to discuss bes
t practices to ensure we are addressing the CCSS and providing students with the best 
learning environment we can.
 
 
PLC work continues to be an essential value at Culverdale and IUSD.  All teachers in grades 1
-
6 have a dedicated 45
-
minute 
block one time pe
r week to discuss student progress and concerns, and this embedded PLC time has ensured we continue 
to refine our teaching practices.  TK and kindergarten teachers meet daily after school dismisses, to align their efforts and
 
analyze student data for next 
steps.  On a monthly basis, our school's MTSS team (Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Supports) 
convenes to discuss one student per grade level, based on PLC teams having already collaborated for interventions and 
not seeing measurable progress afterward.
 
 
Six weeks
 
into the school year, the principal used roving subs to check
-
in with each teacher for 15 minutes.  Our PLC 
Facilitator Coach (and on occasion, the principal) are able to work with teachers to provide instructional, assessment, and 
guidance and coaching d
uring the PLC time.  Starting in January 2020, each PLC team began recording their weekly focus
-
topic(s) on a shared Google Sheet.  We also have two teacher "tech coaches" and one media
-
tech who are able to support 
teachers in the technology implementation
.
