Lindo Park Elementary is a neighborhood school serving the Lakeside Community for more than 
seventy years. We are located in a semi

acre 
county park and lake are directly across the street from our school. We serve a variety of residential 
areas. Our community is culturally diverse and provides us with a rich cultural heritage. Our keys to 
successful teaching and learning a
re a highly trained staff, engaging instruction, digital 
opportunities, dedicated parents, supportive community partnerships, and most importantly 
energetic, resilient students who come to school each day wanting to learn and excel.
 
 
We have evening activi
ties for parents and students including Family Science Night, Bingo Night, 
PTA School Smarts Parent Academy, and Family Literacy Nights, in addition to Primary and

learning opportunities. Additionally, an expert music teacher offers weekly instruction to 5th grade 
students.
 
 
Lindo Park Elementary creates opportu

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Lindo Park is maintained by dedicated custodial and district maintenance staff. Sites are painted and carpeted on a regular b
asis. All sites have recently 
completed modernization constr
uction. During modernization, all walls, roofs, floors, plumbing, and electrical have been updated to reflect current 
demands including technology upgrades. Rest rooms and fire alarms systems were updated, along with heating and cooling system
s upgraded to
 
ensure 
efficient energy use. Community Safety Meetings are held with representatives from the sites and community to discuss safety 
issues for each of the 
sites.
 
 
Our School Bond allowed us the opportunity to rewire Lindo Park for robust electrical and te
chnological improvement. We are proud of the digital 
opportunities that students can access at our site.  Deferred maintenance funding allowed us to completely redo all playgroun
d asphalt and striping. In 
addition, the D Wing received a new roof, and new a
ir
-
conditioning units were installed where needed.
 
 
Everyone at Lindo Park takes PRIDE in our school. We are nestled across from a picturesque county park and lake. This wildlif
e preserve gives our students 
access to an authentic outdoor classroom and our 
school has the privilege of collaborating with county park rangers to further science literacy and an 
understanding of environmental science. Classrooms and digital resources display student work reflecting California Common Co
re State Standards and 
innova
tive projects. Student work is also displayed in the multi
-
purpose room, front office, hallways, surrounding fences and library. Student
-
created 

door wall mural shares our love of 
environment.
 
 
The playgrounds, library, as well as other facilities have been supported and maintained by PTA, Boys and Girls Club, Barona 
Band of Mission Indians, El 

ndividual community members.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Con
struction.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

School Safety Plan
 

hool Plan. This plan was 
developed in consu
ltation with law enforcement and fire departments, as part of a Readiness Emergency Management System.
 
 
The key elements to our plan are classrooms that are up to fire
-
department code, updated emergency and disaster plans (updated, reviewed and 
discussed with faculty), regular monthly safety drills, and clear communication protocols between staff and office. Informati
on regarding safety is 
presented yearly at staff meetings and throughout the year. All classrooms and student areas are equipped wi
th appropriate communication and 
emergency disaster plans and materials located above fire extinguishers.
 
 
As a result of this plan, we have installed cameras throughout the school with a central computer monitor system that allows 
us to view school areas 
throughout the day. All non
-
students and visiting adults are required to follow visitor protocol that requires signing in and out of the office upon ever
y 
visit. Our campus is completely enclosed by fencing and we lock our gates shortly after class begins.
 
To ensure the safety of our students, staff, and all 
visitors, our teacher
-
trained safety patrol is on duty daily to monitor the safe flow of vehicles and students. To ensure traffic safety, motion se
nsor flashing 
lights are installed at the east end of s
chool, where Lakeshore Drive intersects Petite Lane, reducing the average speed of cars in front of our school. Our 
Fire Safety Lanes have been re
-
marked, including updated curbing and directional signs. Speed bumps are in the parking lot we share jointly 
with the 
Boys and Girls Club. School
-
wide safety/disaster preparedness procedures have been developed and are practiced regularly.
 
 
At district
-
wide community safety meetings, our school works closely with local law enforcement and fire protection to proac
tively ensure safety.  Motion 
sensor lighting has been installed through portions of the campus. Neighbors monitor our school site during weekends and holi
days, reporting any 

amera system has successfully kept our campus free of graffiti and loitering. 
Additionally, fences secure our student population during school hours and protect our property, when school is not in sessio

Committee and PTA have created
 
emergency kits designed to aid students in the event of a disaster, in addition to ensuring that bottled water and 
nutrition are available to each classroom.

curriculum for all students 
to reach their maximum potential. We work collaboratively in professional learning communities to suppo

academic achievement. As stated, Lindo Park School receives funds from the state and federal government to support students w
ho are below grade 
level in reading and/or mathematics and those who are learning Eng
lish as their second language. In addition to core instructional time, we provide 
intensive support to students in small group settings.
 
 
Our core instructional time is from the beginning of school until 2:10 pm, with a lunch and recess break. It focuses o
n dedicated, uninterrupted English 
and Mathematics instruction, with a science and social studies focus in the afternoon. During the morning block, we use a uni
versal access model in 
which students are regrouped within grade levels to best target specific 
academic needs. Teachers meet regularly in professional learning communities 
to review student work and progress towards California Common Core State Standards. We use state
-
adopted instructional materials including a rigorous, 
research
-
based reading progr
am from Houghton
-
Mifflin Harcourt, called READ 180, System 44, and iRead for students needing literacy intervention and 
prevention. In addition, we utilize an award
-
winning reading comprehension program focused on non
-
fiction text called Achieve3000. Our m
athematics 
program is Everyday Math, from McGraw
-
Hill Publishers.
