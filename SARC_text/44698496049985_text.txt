Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Scotts Foresman Social Studies.  A dual committee has been formed to revi
ew NGSS materials and HSS materials.  
At this time the decision to work toward the NGSS adoption first is in place.  We are working collaboratively with Lawrence 
Hall of Science Bay Sci group.  Mystery Science is used a supplemental. The current Science ad
option dates before Common 
Core 

Scott Foresman (4th and 5th grade) and DELTA FOSS Science.(K

3rd grade).
 
 
In the areas that Common Core materials either have not been released by the state or were recently released (science

ion and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are alig
ned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the r
equirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school district is a small district with approximately 2,000 students.  Therefore, all schools are 
covered by a district 
wide Safe Schools Plan. This plan stresses emergency preparation and was developed in conjunction with law enforcement 
and county emergency services.  All buildings housing students meet Field Act standards.  The Fire Department and t
he 
district inspect facilities annually.

Over the past three years our district has spent a great deal of professional learning on positive behavior intervention 
support (PBIS), social emotional academic development (SEAD), and multi
-
tiered systems of support (MTSS). In 
2016
-
2017, 
district administration including the Superintendent, Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services, Director of Student 
Services and two principals participated in eight days of implementation training for Multi
-
Tiered System of Supports, 
MT
SS.  From this professional development, and through a specialized grant, the district is participating in a second year 
of PBIS support at two schools, Soquel and Santa Cruz Gardens Elementary Schools. Leadership teams from each of these 
site are comprise
d of the principal, teachers, campus supervisors and parents. These teams are in initial implementation 
and data collection phases. PBIS is the continued work at each school site, as is SEAD, which include alternative means of 
correction, RULER, mindfulnes
s, classroom charters and more.
 
 
Some development by content/subject are as follows:
 
 
Math:  Silicon Valley Math Initiative has been offered as a summer week
-
long training opportunity for the 2013

d professional development for 
Readers/Writers workshop through Momentum. In 2018
-
2019 a Readers/Writers teacher on special assignment was hired 
full time to support staff with the curriculum complexities. Teachers were also given the opportunity to partic
ipate in half 
day release so they could observe veteran teachers and then debrief with a small group that was viewing the lesson.
 
 
ELA/ELD:  English Language Development teachers, Principals and District Administration have trained at the County Office 
of 
Education and attended the ELA/ELD Framework Intensive Summer Institute offered through WestEd in 2015

-
2018 and 2018
-
2019 all principals, Assista
nt Superintendent of Educational Services and ELD specialists were trained in the new ELPAC 
testing. However, most recently a specialist, teacher and administrative representative team has begun training on the

Science:  In 2017
-
2018 the NBMS science department along with the vice principal participated in two days of training on 
the transition to NGSS.  In 2018
-
2019 a vertical team made up of the Superintendent, Assistant Superintendent, o
ne 
elementary principal, the middle school vice principal and four teachers worked with the Lawrence Hall of Science Bay Sci 
group to learn about NGSS and look at materials adoption. Most recently, Soquel Union Elementary has partnered with 
BAY SCI to furt
her science and NGSS throughout our district. Through this partnership, a new science mission has been 
developed and communicated, a timeline has been created, a science leadership team has formed, regular leadership 
meetings are held
-
 
focusing on best sci
ence practices, and district
-
wide staff development in the areas of Evidence 
Statements and Science journaling have been jointly planned and implemented.
 
 
In addition to all of the above, for the past three years teachers have participated in three profess
ional development days 
per year on non
-
student days, as well as one and a half hours on early release Fridays to engage in targeted district
-
led 
development, grade level collaboration, or school
-
focused meeting time.  And because the needs of each site and
 
teacher 
team differ, an additional several days are set aside for local
-
 
interest professional development.
