follows: 89% of our students met or exceeded standards in English Language Arts/Literacy and 88% 
met or exceed standards in Mathematics. Our students continue to amaze us with their 
academic 
prowess, and they are just as skilled in their interactions with others. 
 
 
Our school offers a rigorous and challenging curriculum that is differentiated for our students. Our 
children learn from a staff that is dedicated to providing not only a s
trong academic program, but

society. As our children develop
 
a positive sense of self, they will be equally as successful in school 
as they are outside of school. Our students are respectful of themselves and of others and see 
themselves as members of a community. We value each child, parent, and staff member and m
odel 
good behavior. We strive to create an environment of trust and caring, representative of our larger 
community, that allows all of our wonderful children to soar.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, A
vailability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Evergreen School District held a Public Hearing on October 10, 2010, and determined that each school within the district has 
sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of Californi
a.
 
 
All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects 
for use in the classroom and to take home. All textbooks and instructional materials used within 
the district must be aligned with the California State 
Content Standards, with final approval by the Board of Trustees. Textbooks and supplementary materials are typically adopted 
according to a cycle 
developed by the California Department of Education. Th
e table displays information collected in September 2018 about the quality, currency, and 
availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. The district does not have a formal textbook adoption
 
for Health
 
or for Visual and Performing Arts.
 
 
The California State Board of Education adopted science programs at its November 2018 public meeting.  Evergreen will review 
materials in 2019
-
20 to 
determine next steps.  The California State Board of Education adopted
 
Social Science materials at its November 2017 public meeting aligned to the new 
California Framework.  The California Social Science standards remain unchanged.
 
 
Pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, a school district may 
utilize instructional materials not adopted by the SBE, so long as the 
materials are aligned to state standards and a majority of the participants of any review process conducted by the district a
re classroom teachers who 
are assigned to the subject area o

2020. The chart displays the results of the most recent facilities inspection.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
Tom Matsumoto Elementary School
 
provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district has adopted cleaning standards 
for all schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the school year with emp
hasis on cl
assrooms and 
restrooms. A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

staff to develop sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning en
vironment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair
 

 
heavy maintenance 
functions occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintena
nce program is administered by Evergreen School District to ensure that 
school grounds and facilities remain in excellent repair. A work order process is used when issues arise that require immedia
te attention. Emergency 
repairs are given the highest prior
ity; repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The State School Deferred Maintenance Program provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts wi
th expenditures 
for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. In the Budget Act of July 2
009, the State Legislature provided school districts with flexibility in 
using these funds to meet general fund needs. In an effort to mitigate the effects of declining state revenues, the Evergreen
 
School District has taken 
advantage of this flexibility. 
The district will utilize bond funds and other appropriate sources to ensure its facilities are clean, safe and in good repai
r.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students

aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities);

Number of school days 
dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Staff members build teaching skills and concepts through participation in Professional Learning Communities (PLCs), conferenc
es, and workshops 
throughout the year.  For the past four 
years, the district has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad
-
based 
variety of professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.
 
 
The administration along with the teachers
 
of Tom Matsumoto Elementary School seek out opportunities to travel offsite to attend workshops, 
conferences, and inservices with the understanding that those staff members will bring back information to share with all sta
ff. As we implement the 
Common Co
re State Standards, our focus has been on shifts in teaching strategies, observation of deployment of the CCSS in other schoo
ls and districts, 
and the practical of use of technology for problem solving, critical thinking, and testing.
 
 
The administration h
as been instrumental in helping our teachers and staff understand best teaching practices and helps to ensure that teachers f
eel 
supported in the classroom. The administrator is available to support classroom instruction, works with teachers at weekly st
af
f meetings, and discuss 
goals regularly to ensure needs are being addressed.
