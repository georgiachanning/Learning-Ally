About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publis
h a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a
 
Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent w
ith data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abou
t the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal 
or the

Bradley Union Elementary held a public hearing on September 23, 2016 and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good 
quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursu
ant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, 
including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the 
classroom and to take h
ome. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are re
viewed by all
 
teachers and 
a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommende
d materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education populati
on and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
