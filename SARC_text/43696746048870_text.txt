By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
George Mayne Elementary School is a Professional Learning Community of learners, leaders and thinkers focused on the 
belief in a growth mindset for parents, students and our school team. Our partnerships with paren
ts, businesses and the 
broader community help us to provide a quality education in a supportive, multi
-
lingual environment where each child's 
worth and potential is valued. Our Mayne Mission is Equity and Excellence in Education which means we are dedicate
d to 
doing what is best for children in order to enable them to meet the challenges of the twenty
-
first century. The school 
promotes the District's goal to "prepare every student to succeed in an ever
-
changing world," by meeting State and District 
content 
and life
-
long learning standards and by providing a positive learning climate for social
-
emotional well
-
being and 
development. Our Mayne Vision: We are Eagles Soaring to Success is a reference to our school mascot, the eagle and our 
SOAR Program of Safe, O
rganized Achievers who are Respectful. It is also a description of our belief that every child (eagle) 
will soar (succeed) and has an unlimited potential to reach new heights of achievement.
 
 
The school has an outstanding team of classified and certificate
d personnel who work together in grade level and group 
teams and as a site to constantly improve teaching and learning as well as comprehensive services for parents, students, 
and our community. We know that our students have to succeed in a competitive wo
rkplace where an emphasis is placed 
on high
-
level literacy, mathematics and communication skills, as well as the ability to work together. Students are being 
taught with an eye on having personal standards of excellence, motivation to succeed socially, emo
tionally and 
academically. Over time this has resulted in significantly raising achievement at our school.
 
 
George Mayne School is one of only two schools in Santa Clara Unified that has both an English and a Bilingual 
Spanish/English Program. We have a hi
story of successfully implementing a strong bilingual classroom program that 
supports our students and community as well as providing a fully included Special Education Program where students 
consistently show growth.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
 
Santa Clara Unified School District (SCUSD) takes 
great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To 
assist in this effort, SCUSD uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California OPSC. The results of this
 

acilities department at (408) 423
-
2061.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
SCUSD maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest prior
ity.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in SCUSD, Board Policy 3514. The policy can be found 
online at www.santaclarausd.org/BoardPolicies. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to
 
develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance
 
SCUSD participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program to assist school districts with expenditures for 
major repair or replacement of existing school buildin
g components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
Modernization Projects
 
SCUSD strives to be a model of financial responsibility, making every effort 
to spend taxpayer dollars wisely. At the same 
time, ongoing bond programs are necessary in a district this large, with so many students, teachers, and facilities needs. 
Bond funds allow the District to maintain safe, modern school facilities and bring in u
pdated technology essential to 
student achievement. Measure B 1997 improvements included new elementary school play structures, new high school 
science classrooms and outdoor athletic facilities, the major renovation of eleven elementary schools, an ambiti
ous roof 
replacement program, and two high school performing arts buildings. Measure J 2004 generated funds to modernize 
buildings and classrooms for middle schools, high schools, and the adult education campus. Measure H 2010 upgraded 
fire, safety and sec
urity systems, renovated and reopened a closed elementary school, installed solar panels to decrease 
energy costs, purchased the Agnews campus property, and expanded overcrowded schools. Measure H 2014 funds 
construction of three new schools on the Agnews 
campus, expands overcrowded schools, and addresses critical facility 
needs such as replacing roofs and adding air conditioning to elementary school classrooms. Measure BB 2018 funds the 
construction of three new schools, reconstructs fields, replaces aging
 
play structures and playground paving, adds shade 
structures, and upgrades fencing and gates, among many other crucial projects. More: www.santaclarausd.org/bond
 
 
Age of School Buildings
 
The main campus of George Mayne School was built in 1955 and 1960. C
lassrooms and a library were constructed in 1974 
and the Multipurpose Room in 1975. Mayne School was totally renovated 2000 
-
 
2005. Three new kindergarten classrooms 
were constructed in 2004
-

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Calif
ornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternat
e achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for e
ntrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the

scores.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
All California public schools kindergarten and grades one through twelve must develop a comprehensive school safety 
plan, per California Education Code sections 32280
-
32289. School safety plans assess school climate and safety, identifying 
goals and action
s to improve safety and climate. The safety plan is written and developed with collaboration from 
students, parents, community, and law enforcement. It is reviewed and updated annually with the School Site Council 
(SSC).
 
 
We are committed to providing a sa
fe, responsible and respectful school environment for all students, staff, and 
community. We support and promote building a sense of community and belonging where every child feels included and 
valued, teaching children positive social skills and attitudes
 
including resolving conflicts without violence, and preparing 
for and responding appropriately to emergencies and disasters to keep children safe.
 
 
The school safety plan is available for review in the school office and was approved by the School Site Cou
ncil in 2019.

Staff development activities and expenditures are tied to District and school goals including the SPSA, WASC, LCAP, and 
District Strategic Plan. Staff development time continues to support teachers in 
self
-
reflection, analysis of student 
achievement data, and collaboration activities designed to help reach achievement goals. We believe in modeling lifelong 
learning for our students by engaging in collaborative sessions and professional development oppor
tunities that align with 

School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) goals and support student achievement in content standards and 
Expected Schoolwide Learning Results (ESLRs). District and school staff development programs support meeting the
 
academic, social, and emotional needs of all students by providing opportunities for teachers to advance their skills, 
develop teaching strategies, and create curriculum. During staff in
-
service days, teachers share information about 
instructional practic
es, cognitive development and learning disabilities, and best practices for English Language Learners. 
These presentations and workshops help us understand who our students are so we can better support them with 
individual counseling, curriculum design, an
d instructional practices.
 
 
There are four days dedicated to professional development in the 2019
-
2020 school year. There were five days of 
professional development in the 2018
-
2019 school year, eight days of professional development in the 2017
-
2018 schoo
l 
year, and eight days of professional development in the 2016
-
2017 school year. In addition, there is professional 
development happening on the school campus through professional learning communities, where teachers meet to 
discuss best practices while as
sessing student work.
