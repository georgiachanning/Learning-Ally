About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to 
publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to pre
pare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consis
tent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more informatio
n about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school prin
cipal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, 
Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Monterey Peninsula Unified School District held a public hearing on August 2019, and determined that the school had sufficien
t and good quality 
textbooks and instructional material
s, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given 
their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and t
o take home. Textbooks 
and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making the 
textbooks used in the 
school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewe
d by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School 
Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent ex
amination at the district 
office prior to adoption. The table displays
 
information collected in August 2018 about the quality, currency, and availability of the California Common 
Core standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
In 2010, the Monterey Peninsula Unified Schoo
l District overwhelmingly approved Measure P, a $110 million locally
-
controlled school bond measure to 
fund the first phase of critical repairs and improvement to our local schools. The district's newest school was built in 1965
, more than 50 years ago, an
d 
our Facilities Needs Assessment has identified over $680 million in critical repairs to all MPUSD schools. Recently, in 2018,
 
voters approved Measure I, a 
$213 million school facilities bond by 70%.
 
 
Many school bond projects are underway. Visit 
www.mpusd.net and search for Measure I & P Dollars at Work for additional details.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the
 
Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will fi
nd is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical systems, heating an
d ventilation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and
 
in good repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for
 
this assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brough
t about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the six

page Facilities Inspection 
Tool used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC.

in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school 
district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents make up an essential component of the Foothill Elementary School experience. All pare
nts are encouraged to participate in their child's 
educational community through the PTA (Parent Teacher Association) network of volunteers, or by contacting  their child's tea
cher, the principal, or our 
office at (831) 649
-
1744. Our School Site Council, t
he English Learner Advisory Committee, PBIS (Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports) team and 
PTA are a few avenues for structured parent involvement. Our School Site Council, which includes parent members meets monthly
 
to  monitor the 
implementation
 
of our School Plan for Student Achievement, the effectiveness of our school improvement strategies and ensures the alignment 
of our 
site budget to those efforts. In addition, we have an English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) to help monitor the effecti
veness of English Learner 
Programs, instructional strategies and to help promote attendance. Our PTA meets monthly, hosts monthly events and provides s
upport to our students 
and staff. They sponsor classroom fieldtrips, PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention
 
and Supports) incentives, family nights, and various seasonal activities. 
Our PTA also raised funds to provide state of the art play equipment in all three, primary, intermediate, and upper play area
s. We invite you to join the 
school PTA to support the e
ducational processes at Foothill.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Oth
er local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The safety and well being of students and staff are high priorities for the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District and th
is school. Under Senate Bill 
187, every school in the district is req
uired to complete (or review and update) a School Safety Plan of each year. The plan is reviewed and evaluated by 
the School Safety Planning Committee, the School Site Council, and the school principal before being presented to the Board o
f Education for f
inal review 
and adoption. The approved plans are posted on each school's website, as well as the district website at www.mpusd.net.

FLY; focus with intention, lead by example, and yearn for personal and academic growth, are 
practiced by all students and staff. The Second Step and Playworks curriculum are taught school
-
wide (TK
-
5) and daily clas
sroom meetings are held to 
assist in the development of good citizens and provide scholars with the tools to resolve conflict constructively and navigat
e peer situations peacefully. 
We have a Family Services Specialist on site two days a week to support st
udents with situations they may experience with family, school, or transitions.
 
 
Each year we update our school safety plan and we routinely practice ALICE safety protocols, earthquake, shelter in place and
 
fire drills. The plan is 
available for parents to
 
review. We teach playground equipment and game rules, and staff members monitor playgrounds before school and during 
recess and lunch. Our school safety committee reviews procedures for emergencies and plays an important role in our Disaster 
Preparedness 
Plan. Each 
month we practice a fire drill; at least once a quarter we practice  ALICE protocols, earthquake and shelter in place drills.
 
 
We ask that all visitors to the site honor our visitor protocol: always visit the office before coming on site during 
the school day to sign in and always wear 
a visitor's badge when on school grounds.

consultants, district profession
al development coordinators, and on

In addition, teachers receive individualized feedback from the instructional leader and the academic coach through ongoing ob
servation
 
and feedback 
cycles.

to be lower operating costs 
at the school site level.
