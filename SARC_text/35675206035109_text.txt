By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Panoche School District is a one room K
-
8 school, located in a rural area of Central Californ
ia. California Department of 
Education data for 2018
-
2019 school year lists Panoche as the smallest district in the entire state. Census day enrollment 
for the 2019
-
2020 school year was 4 students total. The school has a 25% English Learner Population and 
50% of students 
are classified as low income. The school employs a single individual who is responsible for teaching all grade levels, as wel
l 
as fulfilling the roles of principal and superintendent. In addition, this individual fulfills the duties of all 
other positions 
typically required to run a school. A new teacher/administrator was hired for the 2019
-
2020 school year.
 
At Panoche School, cooperation and communication are key to a productive classroom culture. The mission of Panoche 
School is to provide
 
an individualized education for each student in a nurturing environment, with focus on motivating 

location and small class sizes (often only
 
one student per grade level) allows for a high level of differentiated instruction, 
allowing students to learn and demonstrate their knowledge in the most optimal format for each individual learner.

when the textbooks currently in use at the school were actually adopted due to insufficient record keeping in past years. 
Consequently, copyright dates for textbooks are listed, which may not necessarily correspon
d to actual year of adoption. 
All currently enrolled students have access to their own assigned textbook for all core subjects. The school has also 
invested in the online based supplemental curriculum programs IXL and ST Math.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Panoche School staff participates in monthly safety 

Associates. Grounds and facilities are monitored daily by on
-
site staff. Each month, the school exterior play area is formally 
inspected with accompanying documentation. Twice a year, 
the classroom area is formally inspected with accompanying 
documentation. The school is cleaned daily by Panoche School staff and professionally cleaned weekly. The grounds are 
professionally maintained on a weekly basis. Pest control is professionally com
pleted monthly.
 
Panoche School recently completed the installation of solar panels on campus, as well as a conversion from natural gas to

Panoche School is maintained in good repair with only one non
-
critical deficiency noted. Fire Extinguishers are present 
throughout the school in appropriate areas, with
 
proper signage in place noting locations. The fire extinguishers 
throughout campus were last inspected/recharged in April 2018, making them overdue for service. This deficiency was 
brought to the attention of the Panoche School Board September 2019, durin
g which time the FIIT Report was board 
approved. Both the Panoche School Board members and the school administration are searching for a vendor that will 
agree to travel to the school and service the extinguishers, but thus far none has been located. Alter
native methods have 
been discussed, such as the possibility of bringing the extinguishers into Hollister to be serviced.

California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority:
 
Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Due to a change in 
administration for the 19
-
20 school year and inadequate record keeping, no data on parental 
involvement and/or programs offered for previous years is available. Consequently, information discussed in this section 
contains information only pertaining to 201
9
-
2020 data.
 
 

principal/teacher sees and interacts with all 3 mothers of students at the school each day at pick up and at drop off. Thi
s 
provides an excellent means of communication between home and school and facilitates a strong positive relationship 
between parents and school staff. Parents are verbally invited to attend all board meetings, with one parent consistently 
attending each m
onthly meeting.

Parents are also encouraged to join students in educational opportunities off campus. So far in the 2019
-
2020 school year, 
Panoche School has held a Back to School Night BBQ that was 100% attended by parents, as well as several grandparents
. 
All 3 mothers accompanied students on a field trip to the San Benito County Fair, and all 3 mothers plus a grandmother 
accompanied students on a field trip to the Panoche Valley Solar Project. First trimester parent/teacher conferences were 
held in Novem
ber with at least one parent from each family in attendance. This year, Panoche School launched a Facebook 
page, with the majority of page maintenance and posting done by one of our parents. The page is liked/followed by 100% 
of parents and provides an add
itional means of communication between school and home.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Panoche School Emergency and School Safety Plan was reviewed 
and updated in 2019. The plan was prepared in 
compliance with the legal requirements established by California administrative code. The final draft of the updated plan 
was published March 20th, 2019. All board members and parents had the opportunity to vie
w the plan during this time. 
A hard copy is on file at Panoche School for public viewing by appointment, with duplicate copies available upon request. 
The Safety Plan is also available in digital format on the Panoche Elementary School website.
 
 
The major 
objective of the Panoche School Emergency and School Safety Plan is to provide a model for the developement 
of school plans, and in so doing, to save lives and protect property in the event of a disaster. The plan provides a framewor
k 
for protecting studen
ts, the teacher/principal, and any other persons that may be onsite in the case of an emergency. The 
plan also describes the responsibilities of those present for a wide range of emergency and disaster situations that may 

al location, the plan assumes that the school must be self
-
sufficient for a time and may 
be required to provide shelter to the immediate community.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous
 
Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Due to inadequate records and a change in administration for the 19/20 school year, no data is available regarding 
professional development during the 17/18 and 18/19 school years. Data provided covers the 19
-
20 school year only. 
Primary 
areas of focus for staff development for the 19/20 school year are as follows:
 

 
Staff education regarding Autism Awareness and support for teachers educating students diagnosed with 
Autism. This area of focus was selected due to the demographics of the curr
ent student population.
 

 
Literature, with focus on assisting students in understanding key ideas and details, craft and structure, and 
integration of knowledge and ideas in Informational Text. This area of focus was selected using student 
achievement data f
rom the Star360 assessment.
 

ate 
in professional development is very limited. Online PD is utilized, including (but not limited to) 
training offered through 
Keenan & Associates (Autism) and Newsela (Informational Text). The teacher/principal also participates in monthly LCAP 

CSS, 
Educational Equity, ELPAC, and CAASPP. There is also an ongoing effort by Panoche School staff to identify and secure a 

ge of 
PD, although none has been located thus far.
