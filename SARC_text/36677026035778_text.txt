By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Etiwanda Intermediate provides a safe and clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance and 
campus supervision.  Original s
chool buildings were constructed in 1938, modernized in 1997, and additional construction 
in 2006. Ongoing maintenance ensures school facilities are kept safe, in good working condition, and continue to provide 
adequate space for students and staff.
 
 
Etiwa
nda Intermediate is proud of its high standards regarding campus maintenance and general housekeeping practices. 
Staff and students enjoy the benefits of having a well
-
maintained and beautiful campus.
 
 
School staff and the maintenance department work toget
her to ensure fields, classrooms, and campus grounds are well
-
maintained. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) oversees a work order process enabling school staff to communicate 
unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. School staff c
ommunicates with the school office 
clerk who prepares and submits a formal work order to M&O for resolution. Emergency situations are given high priority 
and resolved immediately by site or district custodial staff. The principal and day custodian communic
ate on a daily basis 
and meet monthly to discuss campus maintenance and safety concerns. The director of maintenance and operations 
(M&O) meets with the principal once a month to discuss maintenance
-
related issues associated with campus upkeep, 
safety, cla
ssroom space, equipment, upcoming events, work orders (submitted and outstanding), and special requests. 
The director of M&O then meets with the custodian to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the school site, and a 
summary of the inspection findings is
 
forwarded to the principal.
 
 
Schools are required by state law to conduct a formal inspection annually of designated areas and systems and then 
prepare a report on the current condition of facilities. The School Site Inspection table illustrated in this r
eport identifies 
the state
-
required inspection areas and discloses the operational status in each of those areas.
 
 

maintenance, and minor repairs. 
M&O provides formal training twice a year on the proper use of equipment, cleaning 
procedures, and chemical usage. One full
-
time day custodian and one full
-
time evening custodian are responsible for 
keeping the campus clean and fully operational. The custo

office, PE area, locker rooms, gym, and stocking student restrooms.
 
 
Every morning before school begins, the day custodian inspects school facilities for safety hazards and maintenance issues 
t
hat require attention before staff and students arrive on campus. Any graffiti or signs of vandalism are removed 
immediately. Restrooms are checked frequently as a proactive measure in keeping facilities stocked, safe, and sanitary.

repairs typically include roofing,
 
plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior/exterior painting, and

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School
