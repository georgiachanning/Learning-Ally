By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
David W. Long 
Elementary provides a safe and clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance and 
campus supervision. Original school buildings were constructed in 1999. Ongoing maintenance ensures school facilities 
are kept safe, in good working con
dition, and continue to provide adequate space for students and staff.
 
 
David W. Long Elementary is proud of its high standards regarding campus maintenance and general housekeeping 
practices. Staff and students enjoy the benefits of having a well
-
maintain
ed and beautiful campus.
 
 
School staff and the maintenance department work together to ensure playgrounds, classrooms, and campus grounds are 
well
-
maintained. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) oversees a work order process enabling school staff to 
communica
te unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Work orders are prepared and 
submitted to M&O through the collective efforts of the school secretary, principal, teaching vice
-
principal, and custodian. 
Emergency situations are given h
igh priority and resolved immediately by site or district custodial staff.
 
 
The principal and day custodian communicate daily on an informal basis to discuss campus maintenance and safety 
concerns. The director of Maintenance and Operations (M&O) meets wit
h the principal once a month to discuss 
maintenance
-
related issues associated with campus upkeep, safety, classroom space, equipment, upcoming events, work 
orders (submitted and outstanding), and special requests. The director of M&O then meets with the cu
stodian to conduct 
a comprehensive inspection of the school site, and a summary of the inspection findings is forwarded to the principal.
 
 
Schools are required by state law to conduct a formal inspection annually of designated areas and systems and then 
pr
epare a report of the current condition of facilities.  The School Site Inspection table illustrated in this report identifie
s 
the state
-
required inspection areas and discloses the operational status in each of those areas.
 
 

odial staff are qualified and equipped to handle routine cleaning needs, general 
maintenance, and minor repairs. M&O provides formal training twice a year on the proper use of equipment, cleaning 
procedures, and chemical usage. One full
-
time day custodian 
is responsible for keeping the campus clean and fully 

cafeteria after meals are served. Every morning before school begins, the day 
custodian inspects school facilities for safety 
hazards and maintenance issues that require attention before staff and students arrive on campus. Any graffiti or signs of 
vandalism are removed immediately.
 
 
A professional janitorial service is responsible 
for thoroughly cleaning classrooms and restrooms during the evenings. The 

irrigation systems.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State pri
ority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parental involvement is 
very important to the Etiwanda School District and David W. Long Elementary School (DWL). This 
state has outlined the involvement of parents as a priority as part of the LCAP.  This is critical for our school to continue
 
to strive for excellence in educati
on. Etiwanda School District organized multiple community forums that allowed parents 
to participate in discussions with site administrators from across the district and district administrators. During these 
sessions, parents were provided with a presentat
ion from our Director of LCAP and Communications about the Local 
Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP). Parents participated in collaborative discussions and became more familiar with 
the state priorities as outlined in the LCAP.  Another important featur
e of the meetings is that parents are able to provide 
evidence of the LCAP in action in our district. In August 2019, the district and each school site provided opportunities for 
parents to provide feedback for the direction of the district and school site
. This was done during Back
-
to
-
School Night. At 
DW Long, we value those parental survey results. The results helped to provide direction for after
-
school activities that 
parents and students would be interested in for the current school year. This continue
s to help shape a variety of new 
programs we offer here at DWL as part of our "Bring Rangers All Valuable Opportunity" (BRAVO) Program.  Prior to the 
start of the school year, we partner with PTO to have an ice cream social for parents and students to come
 
to school and 
revisit old friendships from previous years and create new bonds going into the current year. Additionally, this year we 
opened the campus for families to walk around prior to the school year to better locate their new class.
 
 
Parents are en

committees, and volunteering at the school. The staff welcomes parent assistance in the classroom, library, preparing 
classroom materials, and chaperoni
ng field trips. Back to School Night, Open House, student programs and performances 

in our PTO.  The PTO had well over 800 members 
in the 2019
-
20 school year.  They plan wonderful events such as Book 
Bingo and the Harvest Festival to create an inviting environment for parents and students.  We have also initiated Parent 
Engagement Team Nights focused on reading, math, and technology. 
Some of the parent engagement activities include 
literacy and math focus areas. The School Site Council (SSC), English Language Advisory Council (ELAC), and African 
American Parent and Educator Advisory Committee (AAPEAC) enable parents to provide oversigh
t and input on the school 
budget, activities, and educational programs. Parents who would like to get more involved or volunteer their time may 
contact the school secretary or clerk at (909) 463
-
1626.
 
 
School
-
to
-
home communication takes place in a variety 
of formats. The principal issues a newsletter three times a year to 
update parents on what is happening in school, upcoming events, seasonal topics, PTO meeting dates, health and safety 
tips, fundraising projects, and key information. The school website fe
atures general information about the school and its 
activities, programs, and staff. The school marquee, flyers, automated telephone system, classroom newsletters, and 
parent conferences are used to convey important messages, reminders, and announcements c
oncerning students and 
school activities. Parents may access Aeries.Net Parent Portal to view the most up
-
to
-

Parents are able to receive e
-
mails every time their child takes an Accelerated Reader test through Renaiss
ance Place. This 
provides them with quick updates of how their child is progressing on his or her reading comprehension. Parents are also 
able to have weekly e
-
mails sent to them with the most current grades and assignments. The district maintains an onlin
e 
mailing list for parents who wish to receive e
-
mail announcements and messages related to David W. Long Elementary 
and the district.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan was originally developed for David W. Long Elementary in collaboration with 
local agencies and district administration to fulfill Senate Bill 187 requirement
s. Components of this plan include child 
abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, 
procedures for safe arrival and departure from school, the sexual harassment policy, and the dress code p
olicy. 
Additionally, information on the district's anti
-
bully policy is included. The most current Comprehensive School Site Safety 
Plan was reviewed and approved by the School Site Council on December 5, 2019.  Prior to that, the Plan was reviewed 
with PT
O board members and shared with the school staff in September 2019.
