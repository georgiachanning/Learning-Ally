By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Sunset Hills Elementary School, established in 1974, has a reputation for providing an excellent learning environment for 
students. We pride ourselves on implanting a positive school wide climate where "Seagulls Soar and Character Counts!" 
Sunset Hills currently serves approximately 430 students in Transitional Kindergarten through Fifth grade. This quaint 
elementary school is located in Rancho Penasquitos and is part of the renowned Poway Unified School District (PUSD). 
The families of Suns
et Hills represent more than 27 languages. Of the languages, Vietnamese at 3% and Spanish at 2% are 
the most popular languages spoken. Eight (8%) of our population are Limited  English Language Learners. Ten (10%) of our 
students qualify for the Free and R
educed Lunch Program. Enhancing the schools diversity is the self
-
contained special 
education classes.
 
Seventeen (17%) of our total population are designated students with disabilities. Many of our Special 
Education Students are mainstreamed into the gener
al education classes. This provides a valuable experience for all.
 
 
Sunset Hills Elementary School is a proud member of the NO EXCUSES UNIVERSITY (NEU) national network of schools. 
College readiness is not the expectation that all students will attend coll
ege, but instead, it is the belief that we must 
prepare all students to have a full range of postsecondary education and training options available to them after high 
school. We believe that elementary education is the foundation for all future academic ac
hievement. All of our classrooms 
have adopted a College or University and we proudly wear a college bound No Excuse shirt every Monday to kick off each 
week.
 
 
All staff at Sunset Hills commit to a culture of Universal Achievement for all students. The foll
owing commitment is 
endorsed by all staff: "Universal Achievement is the commitment we make to the academic accomplishments of all 
children.  We hold our students to high standards, with the belief that they are capable learners who have the right to be 
pr
epared for college, careers and a life of learning.  We are further committed to developing the well
-
being of our students 
by encouraging a balance of academic, social and emotional growth.  We commit to a language of hope to foster a positive 
school envir
onment.  At Sunset Hills, all students, parents and staff members are treated with courtesy and respect.  We 
acknowledge that challenges exist, but we refuse to accept excuses." Visitors regularly comment about the friendly and 
welcoming environment of our
 
school and the intense level of commitment every staff member has for each student's 
success. Character Counts lessons are embedded in many activities on campus including our TRRFFC Friday assemblies 
where we come together to celebrate good character, fri
endship, our community and school pride as well as our weekly 
celebration Super Seagull students
 
 
 
Our Sunset Hills community annually develops a 3 Way Pledge (Students + Parents + Teacher = Success) endorsing the 
commitment to student engagement and follo
wing the Character Counts traits in a safe setting. Students, teachers and 
parents create their own pledge at separate summits. The success of Sunset Hills owes much to the staff and parents, who 
give their time, share their skills and donate resources to 
our school. Our biggest strength at Sunset Hills is the sense of a 
caring community who work collaboratively on behalf of each and every student.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Poway 
Unified School District ensures that students attend clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each of its 
schools is maintained in good repair.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained
.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and well maintained.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A night custodial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms and offices daily.  
The district has adopted cleaning standards for all sch
ools.  A summary of these standards is available at the district offices.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and

The cornerstone of this educational parent community is the partnership of the Sunset Hills PTA and Foundation. Here at 
Sunset Hills we are lucky to have two parent
-
driven organizations that work collaboratively to ensure that our students 
have what they n
eed to flourish and enjoy the very best elementary school experience. Our PTA strives each year to bring 
us programs that are academically enriching while the Sunset Hills Foundation works behind the scenes to fund essential 
academic resources. Our PTA spo
nsors programs like the Junior Lego League, Science Fair, Art Gala, Art Odyssey, Encore, 
Spelling Bee, APEX Fun Run, The Sock Hop, The Variety Show, Speak & Sing Spanish class, Running Club, and all school 
assemblies.
 
 
Parents have many opportunities to as
sist at school such as classroom support, instructional support  for small groups, 
morning reads and science experiments. Parents and community members volunteer in classrooms regularly, with more 
than 275 volunteers donating over 15,000 hours last year. O
ur Foundation has raised funds for the Innovation Lab, STEAM 
Instruction, Staff professional development, Reading Support Instructional Assistant for our kindergarten classes and 
Impact Teachers for grades 2
-
5 levels to make academic success a reality for 
ALL students.
 
 
Sunset Hills recognizes the importance of the partnership between home and school. Parents are invited and included to 
serve in an advisory capacity on several committees including but not limited to School Site Council, School,Safety 
Commit
tee, English Learner Advisory Committee, PTA, Foundation and the PUSD District Advisory Committee. Parent 
volunteers perform a variety of functions such as Classroom Support, Morning Readers, Dad's Club, Field Day, Book Fairs, 
Junior Lego League, Math Olym
piad, Running Club, Family Paper Picnics, Community Movie Nights, Science Fair, Art 
Odyssey, Spelling Bee, Fun Run, and TRRFCC Friday assemblies.
 
 
At Sunset Hills there is a strong focus and commitment to reach out to all stakeholders. We continue to find 
ways to 
provide opportunities to educate our parents on current instructional practices, positive parenting techniques and the Six 
Exceptional Systems of our No Excuse University affiliation.
 
 
Parents and families invited to attend Science Fair, Art Gala, 
Back to School Night, TRRFCC

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Sunset Hills places strong emphasis on safety for all students and staff. Our collective goal is to provide a respectful and 
emotionally nurturing educational climate while providing each student with the necessary life skills to be resiliency and 
successf
ul. At Sunset Hills, staff, students and parents work collaboratively to ensure this safe and secure environment. 
The Sunset Hills school wide behavior plan that is based on 3 basic rules: "Respect yourself,
 
others and
 
property, be 
responsible, and be safe
."
 
These 3 rules, along with the defining Character Counts pillars, are displayed in every classroom. 
Twice a year students will participate in assembles, by grade level, to discuss Healthy Choices and revisit behavior 
expectations.
 
 
These assemblies are l
ead by the ESS director and her assistant director.
 
 
The Student Handbook and District Discipline policies and procedures are available for review on the Sunset Hills website. 
Each student receives a hard copy of the current Student Handbook on the first d
ay of school. Parents and students signed 
that they read and understood the school rules. Classroom behavior aligns with the school
-
wide behavior expectations 
and are explained to students in the first weeks of school, posted in each classroom and reviewed
 
at Back to School Night 
for parents. Logical and natural consequences, as well as community service are utilized to help guide students as they 
learn to acquire and practice positive and acceptable behaviors for school.
 
 
The principal and other
 
 
provides 
ongoing training to staff, including character coaches, on teaching and monitoring 
children to be "fair and safe". We are fortunate to have a school counselor three days a week and a Student Services 
Assistant 15 hours a week. Our counselor teaches the Sec
ond Step curriculum to our 3rd 
-
 
5th grade students, works with 
referred students who need assistance, facilitates positive resolution of playground conflicts as well as works with students
 
1:1 or in small groups on specific skills and strategies. Our scho
ol counselor also offers parent workshops to our community 
throughout the school year.
 
 
The Student Services Assistant provides support to students through playground supervision, 
classroom lessons, alternate recess activities, and student lead clubs/group
s ( ie SAVE, Friday Friends Club).
 
 
Our caring front office staff provides healthy snacks to both our low socio
-
economic students, and for those children who 
just need something to eat.
 
 
Emergency plans are reviewed frequently. Fire drills, 
earthquake drills and lockdowns are conducted regularly. As a staff, 
we debrief after each drill and collaborate on next best steps.
 
 
The School Site  Council does an annual safety walk of the campus and contributes to the development of a comprehensive 
sc
hool site safety plan.
 
 
Sunset Hills is a fully contained campus that strives to be non
-
vulnerable to possible intruders.  All visitors must sign in and 
all staff is required to wear their employee badge at all times. Staff is vigilant about keeping all ga
tes locked. Our 
comprehensive safety plan will be signed
 
April
 
2020.
 
 
The district maintains a collaborative relationship with local law enforcement and the Office of Emergency Services to 
ensure optimal preparedness. In collaboration with our law enforcem
ent we adjusted the parking lot traffic flow and 
added appropriate supervision to encourage a safe parking lot at the start and end of each school day.
 
 
Extended Student Services is available to students for before and after school childcare.

Professional growth is a fundamental characteristic of the Sunset Hills staff. We willingly share our expertise with focused 
collaborative activities. Many of our teachers have taken advantage of the district Teacher Learning Cooperative (TLC) as 
a means t
o grow professionally. The staff is committed to continuous improvement in its quest of becoming a highly 
effective school that ultimately creates the culture and conditions to empower world
-
class learners.
 
 
 
The Sunset Hills staff believe in collaborative
, continuous and relevant professional learning. With the input of all staff, a 
leadership team comprised of teachers, classified staff, and specialists participate in the strategic planning process for th
e 
upcoming school year where they discuss instructi
onal planning for the upcoming school year. This team agrees upon a 
focus areas for the upcoming year and devises a Professional Learning Community Plan based on teacher input, surveys, 
and daily communication.
 
 
Each month, a leadership team comes together
 
to discuss best practices, brainstorm ideas to 
move the school forward, and build upon our collaboration culture in the best interst of studcents. This team is a fluid and 
flexible team that changes members form month to month to include all staff by the 
end of the school year. 
 
 
 
Sunset Hills Elementary is committed to implementing the California State Standards and following a systematic approach 
in order to providing training to the staff and quality instruction to our students. As a staff we use our co
llaboratively 
created Theory of Action to guide instruction and continued professional development. The Sunset Hills Theory of Action 
states: If we consistently communicate a clear purpose for learning and provide students with the opportunity to engage 
in
 
rigorous tasks; then students will be able to show their understanding in personalized ways, ultimately being able to 
apply their understanding to make real world connections.
 
 
 
This school year we continued to remain focused on our NEU Continued School V
ision, utilization and continued use of 
the RTI system for all kids, and implementing NGSS (New Generation Science Standards) while maintaining collective 
responsibility for ALL students.
 
 
 
All teachers and staff at Sunset Hills focus their work around the
 
six core exceptional systems as outlined in the No Excuses 
University Network. These include: Culture of Universal Achievement, Collaboration, Standards Alignment, Assessment, 
Data Management and Interventions.
 
 
 
All staff is both offered and required to 
participate in district sponsored professional development. These workshops are 
presented in a semester or year
-
long series and support a wide variety of professional development. These include the 
use of effective instructional strategies, implementing th
e use of computer technology in teaching and learning, critical 
reading, writing and mathematics strategies, effective use of assessments, positive discipline in
-
services, and multicultural 
training. 
 
 
 
Teachers and administrators are actively involved in 
professional development activities at the school, district, state, and 
national level. The Poway Professional Assistance Program (PPAP) provides support for new teachers. Our foundation 
provides 1 full day of release for each teacher on campus to observe 
in another classroom with the intention of continued 
growth and learning.
