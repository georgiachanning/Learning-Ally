By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
2019/10
 
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 12, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality te
xtbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, 
or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home.
 
 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current avail
able. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at 
the district office prior 
to adoption.
 
 
The table displays information collected in August, 2019 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

Our facilities are neat, clean, and in good working order. Facility inspections occur regularly to identify any area of 
immediate concern for repair. Twice per year, a thorough inspection occurs by a team composed of site and district 
personnel to identify
 
future areas to address and prioritize facility needs. Our school has been rated at a "9" or a "10" on 
a 1
-
10 scale each year it has been opened.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.

In the 2017
-
2018 school year, the school site had 10 collaboration/early release days and 5 professional development 
days. In 2018
-
19 school year, the school had 10 collaboration/early release days and 5 professional 
development days.
 
 
Staff development is a critical component to teacher and student success, and Ceres Unified School District is dedicated 
to a variety of professional development opportunities for staff.  Teachers are given regular collaboration time dur
ing 
grade level meetings, staff meetings, early release days, and collaboration assemblies.
 
 
The district manages its BTSA program and works with county office for other trainings and programs dedicated to 
improving teacher quality.  In addition, the distr
ict fully supports classroom teachers with a cadre of full time staff coaches 
who can assist with the implementation of curriculum and strategies. This is often done during afternoon staff meetings, 
release days with coaches, and teacher
-
principal meetings
.  In
-
class coaching and co
-
teaching by the site coach also occur.
 
 
School sites must include a professional development plan and budget in their school site plan.  Activities can include 
attendance at summer institutes, after school or Saturday workshops,
 
teacher release days to attend conferences, and 
grade level or department release days for in depth professional development.  All professional development is aligned to 
the district strategic plan.  The goal of all professional development is to increase
 
student achievement.
 
 
A goal for the Adkison Staff this year is for each staff member to work in collaborative teams to ensure an equitable 
educational experience for all students regardless of the teacher. Teachers have worked to develop Common Formative
 
Assessments which allows teams to share data to determine best instructional practices and intervention plans. In 
addition, professional development time has focused on becoming proficient with ELA and Math curriculum along with 
student reading developmen
t process and reading intervention support.  A focus on Designated English Language 
Development has also been a site focus.
