School Description
 
Vision Statement: Emilie Ritchen is a school community of successful life long learners.
 
Mission Statement: We work together to foster responsibility, respect and appreciation for one 
another, while maintaining high academic and behavioral 
expectations for all students and staff.
 
 
As described within our Vision and Mission Statements, Emilie Ritchen Elementary School is 
committed to providing the best educational program possible for our students. The quality of our 
instructional program is 
a reflection of our highly committed staff. We are dedicated to ensuring 
Ritchen School is a welcoming, stimulating environment where students are actively involved in 
their education, while building positive character traits focused on kindness. Through t
he shared 
vision of our staff, parents, and community, our students are challenged to reach their maximum 
potential.  Our academic focus has centered on building strong foundations in reading, writing, and 
mathematics.  Throughout the 2019
-
20 school year, 
Emilie Ritchen will emphasize building rigor 
across all grade levels, while scaffolding instruction to strengthen students' skills on grade
-
level 
standards.  Students are encouraged and supported to meet their Accelerated Reader trimester 
goals to build th
eir literacy skills and reach their reading potential.  Teachers will also concentrate 
on building students' writing ability across all core content areas to promote critical thinking and 
to better equip students with the skills required to meet expectatio
ns of state
-
wide summative 
assessments.  Finally, teachers will continue focusing on implementing Mathematical Mindset 
strategies across all grade levels, enabling students to build their academic vocabulary and 
reasoning skills in the area of Mathematics.
 
 
Our over
-
arching academic goal is to raise achievement scores for all significant student subgroups.  
Working together as a Professional Learning Community, teachers are part of ongoing, grade
-
level 
collaborative teams that analyze and discuss formative 
and summative assessment data so as to:
 
1. Identify learning targets and objectives from State
-
approved, Board
-
adopted curriculum that are 
aligned to the Common Core State Standards;
 
2. Inform effective classroom instruction practices;
 
3. Provide both Desi
gnated and Integrated English Language Development (ELD) to support English 
Learners' language proficiency skills;
 
4. Integrate classroom technology (e.g., One
-
to
-
One devices, Promethean Boards) to enhance 
student engagement; and,
 
5. Develop and implement 
student support and intervention programs and services for targeted 
students.
 
 
Utilizing the Response to Instruction and Intervention (RTI2) or Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support 
(MTSS) Model, students are identified through the Coordination of Services Team 
(CST) and Student 
Success Team (SST) process to receive Tier I
-
Level Intervention services by classroom teachers 
during daily core instruction in English Language Arts, Mathematics, Social Studies and Science.  Tier 
II to Tier III
-
Level Intervention servic
es are provided by classroom teachers during Universal Access 
and English Language Development, our Intervention Support Providers (ISPs) in small group 
settings, and/or our K
-
2 Reading Specialist, also within a small group setting. Our Reading Specialist 
supports struggling readers in grades Kindergarten, 1st and 2nd with the goal of having 
underperforming students reading at grade level by the time they enter 3rd grade. The Reading 
Specialist works directly with students, collaborates with teachers, and s
erves as a resource for 
reading instruction for both classroom teachers and ISPs.

Aligned to our Strand Focus centered on Science and Technology, classroom teachers provide science lessons and labs to studen
ts utilizing 
Foss Curricular materials aligned to Next Genera
tion Science Standards (NGSS). Identified Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) students, 
as well as other targeted students, are provided academic enrichment through Robotics to meet their academic ability and exte
nd their 
instructional programs. Students 
are also given the opportunity, based on need, to enroll and participate in the Oxnard Scholars after 
school program to receive additional core instruction, academic enrichment, and study skills support. Our Preschool and Trans
itional 
Kindergarten programs
 
prepare students to enter Kindergarten with the academic and social/emotional skills necessary to ensure school 
success.
 
 
Here at Ritchen, we take pride in fostering a safe, positive, and professional learning environment. In order to address our 
students
' social, 
emotional, and behavioral needs, students are identified through the CST and SST process to receive individual and/or small g
roup 
counseling services provided by our school counselor. Our progressive discipline matrix assists teachers and adminis
tration with clear 
guidelines for responding to student behavior at both the classroom and school levels. The Positive Behavior Intervention and
 
Support 
model concentrating on STOIC (Structure, Teach expectations, Observe and monitor, Interact positively, 
and Correct fluently) guides all 
staff in providing a proactive and positive approach to managing student behavior both in and out of the classroom. Our PBIS/
School 
Safety Team meets on an ongoing basis to analyze student discipline data, identify areas of
 
focus, and provide recommendations to school 
staff in order to strengthen our school's positive learning environment. Weekly Eagle Assemblies and monthly Awards Assemblie
s honor 
and recognize the hard work and positive choices students make by rewarding s
tudents with praise, recognition, and incentives.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (S
ARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should cont
act the school principal or the district office.

C. Engagement
 
 
State 
Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each scho
ol site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
In order for students to achieve their fullest potential, we know that parental involvement is a critical factor to ensure st
udents' educational success.  
Our English Learner Advisory Co
mmittee (ELAC), Parent Teacher Association (PTA), and School Site Council (SSC), in coordination with our Outreach 
Coordinator, offer and encourage parents to become active participants in their children's education by participating in the 
meaningful and p
roductive 
opportunities offered.  The school's Parent Involvement Policy provides clear guidelines for parents to serve as volunteers i
n classroom and school 
activities.
 
 
With the strong support of PTA, Ritchen Elementary will provide several opportunities
 
to increase parent involvement and reward students for meeting 
their academic achievement goals during the 2017
-
18 school year.  Family nights focusing on Literacy, Math, Technology and/or Science will engage 
parents and families in academic activities to
 
raise awareness and understanding of the expectations set by the Common Core State Standards.  
Additionally, events such as the Accelerated Reader Carnival, as well as the monthly Eagle Dollar Store and Awards Assemblies
, have been calendared to 
provide s
tudents with academic incentives to meet their learning goals.
 
 
Throughout the year, parents will be invited to attend Parent/Teacher Conferences to collaborate with their child's teacher t
o review achievement data 
and identify strategies for improving stu
dent success.  Parents will also be asked to attend Student Success Team meetings if their child has been identified 
as significantly below grade
-
level standards or is exhibiting significant needs in social, emotional, and/or behavioral areas. Parent train
ing and education 
will be coordinated and provided by the school's Outreach Coordinator to improve parents' ability to support their children's
 
learning.  Finally, the school 
will continue to engage parents during School Site Council, English Language Advi
sory Committee, and Parent Teacher Association meetings to promote 
and sustain parent involvement and home
-
school partnerships.  Moreover, by strengthening home
-
school partnerships to increase parental involvement, 
Emilie Ritchen Elementary School will con
tinue to promote meaningful and rewarding learning experiences for every student.

School Safety Plan
 
At Emilie Ritchen Elementary School, staff are committed to providing all students with a 
safe, nurturing, success
-
oriented learning environment driven 
by CA Common Core standards, differentiated instruction, and formative and summative assessment, while fostering self
-
esteem and mutual respect in 
all students.  The safety and wellbeing of all 
students and staff are primary concerns for Emilie Ritchen Elementary School. Supervision is provided to 
ensure the safety of each student before school, during breaks, at lunch and after school. Student Supervision is conducted b
y school personnel, includ
ing, 
but not limited to, campus supervisors, teachers, instructional aides, custodial staff and administrators.  Emilie Ritchen El
ementary School is a Closed 
Campus.  All gates which provide access to the classrooms and other rooms, except the main office,
 
remain locked during regular school hours.  Staff 
continuously monitors the safety of all students upon arrival and dismissal from school, including at the bus stops, and thro
ughout the school day, 
following established routines and procedures. Visitors t
o the Emilie Ritchen campus must sign in at the front office and wear their visitor badge while 

are always welcome to serve 
as volu
nteers in classrooms, however, school district Volunteer Clearance Procedures must be followed.  Names of approved volunteer 
will be provided 
by the district office only.  At the beginning of the day, the double blue fire doors will be closed and no studen
ts or adults (except staff) are to enter those 
hallways.  All students are to go directly to the cafeteria for breakfast or to the playground.  There will be 5th grade stud
ent escorts to walk students to 
their destination if needed.  The kindergarten playg
round area gate will be used for PreSchool student drop off and pick up ONLY.   PreSchool staff will 
monitor the kindergarten playground area gate. All other students are to enter through main doors.  All exterior doors will b
e locked to deter entrance 
to 
the building except through the front doors at dismissal.
 
 
To safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, a comprehensive School Site Safety Plan has been developed by the School Safety Committee, which
 
includes input by our School Resource Officer, te
achers, parents, and other school personnel. The purpose of the committee is to review the Safety Plan 
on a continual basis and make any necessary changes and adjustments in order to ensure the safety of students and staff membe
rs. The committee 
meets on a
 
monthly basis to review and make any necessary recommendations and changes. All changes are brought to the attention of the e
ntire staff 
and stakeholders, including classified, certificated, and PreSchool program staff, students, and families, at staff, p
arent, and school committee meetings. 
Each school year, the plan is reviewed in the fall (August 
-
 
November), approved by the School Site Council in December, reviewed by the school district 
in January, and approved by the School District Governing Board i
n February. Key elements of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan focus on promoting 
a positive, safe school environment and highlight student supervision, school discipline, emergency response procedures, dres
s code, and safe ingress 
and egress. The school
 
is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. Safe
ty 
drills are held regularly, including monthly fire, earthquake, and/or lock down drills.
