By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of 
students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number 
of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentage
s are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Each school provides multiple
 
options for parents to participate in the educational process.  The school strives to provide 
multiple opportunities for the parents to participate in the planning and improvement of their student(s) academic 
achievements. The school involves parents/fami
lies with regular meetings, timely information and overview about the 
Title I program, explanation of the curriculum and forms of academic assessment to measure student progress, and 
invitations to academic nights, workshops and trainings, as well as other
 
school activities.
 
 
At the district level, parents can participate in the District Advisory Committee (DAC), District English Learners Advisory 
Committee (DELAC), District African American Advisory Council (DAAAC), and a variety of short
-
term, solution
-
or
iented 
focus groups and advisory committees.  Additionally, a Family Resource Center is available from the hours of 8:00 AM 
-
4:30 PM.  Goals of the Family Resource Center include increased home/school communication, increased access to district
-
level paren
t and family training opportunities, and increased access to family involvement resources for district schools.

Date Last Reviewed with Faculty: Nov. 18, 2019
 
 
Every student and teacher has the right to attend a school free 
from physical and psychological harm. To help schools 
achieve these vital goals, the State of California has mandated that each K
-
12 school develop a comprehensive school 

 
planning process in cooperation with 
local public safety agencies, community leaders, parents, pupils, teachers, administrators, and other persons interested 

g key areas:  
preparedness, mitigation and prevention, response and recovery.
 
 
In close cooperation with the California Schools Risk Management (Joint
-
Powers Authority), local police and fire 

ement conducts periodic safety inspections of district 
sites and provides correction reports to site administrators.  A follow
-
up system is in place to ensure timely compliance 
and correction of discrepancies.
 
 
School sites also conduct scheduled drills 
for anticipated emergency situations (such as fires, earthquakes and lockdowns) 
to prepare students, staff, and other stakeholders how to appropriately respond to those emergencies. The district follows 

nt System (SEMS) and the National Incident Management 
System (NIMS) for emergency management.  The Office of Safety and Emergency Management is also tasked with 
coordinating the response and recovery of emergencies or other disasters affecting the SBCUSD.

The California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1, 2018, regarding how to calculate school
-
level 
per
-
pupil expenditures that will be 
reported on 2018
-
19 report cards.
 
 
Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
The common goal of all categorically funded programs in the San Bernardino City Unified School District (SBCUSD) is to 
ensure that all 
students
--
including English learners, educationally disadvantaged pupils, African American, Hispanic English 
only, gifted and talented pupils, and pupils with exceptional needs
--
attain mastery of state and local standards.
 
 
The educational program at each 
site is based on an improvement planning process that includes members of the school 
community such as the principal, teachers, support staff, parents, and students (at the secondary level). These 
stakeholders form the School Site Council (SSC). The SSC de
velops and annually monitors, evaluates and revises a plan 
called the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA). The SPSA, based on self
-
study and collaboration, ensures that all 
of the resources available to the school are coordinated and focused on prov
iding a high
-
quality educational program in 
which all students can achieve success.
 
 
Some students have difficulty mastering academic state and local content standards. They may be at risk of not meeting 
graduation requirements. For these students, categor
ical program funds are provided. Categorical funds are supplemental 
educational dollars used for supports that augment the core instructional program and increase the academic success of 
these students. Categorical funds provide items such as additional pe
rsonnel time, staff development opportunities, 
supplemental student materials, and other specialized services, equipment, and supplies.
 
 
Categorical programs commonly found at SBCUSD sites are:
 

 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Title I, Part A
 

 
Local Co
ntrol Funding Formula (LCFF)
 
 
Additionally, categorical programs have been established at the district level to provide important services and 
instructional support that help increase student success. Categorical funds in this category support District eff
orts in the 
areas of:
 

 
Vocational Education Basic Grant Award (Voc Ed) 

 
Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement 
Act of 2006
 

 
ESSA Title II, Part A 

 
Supporting Effective Instruction
 

 
ESSA Title III, Part A 

 
Language Instruction for Englis
h Learners (EL) and Language Instruction for Immigrant 
Students
 
 
Continuous Improvement
 
LEAs are encouraged to use evidence
-
based interventions that are reasonable, necessary, and consistent with Title I, Part 
A of the ESSA, to improve student achievement 
for those students not meeting grade level standards. At the local level, 
SBCUSD identifies schools with greatest needs, based on a variety of data, including local and state student progress 
indicators, to provide additional resources and services to the 
schools (referred to as Targeted Support for School Progress 
or TSSP). Additionally, the California Dashboard is used to identify schools and student groups in need of Comprehensive 
Support and Improvement (CSI), Targeted Support and Improvement (TSI), and
 
Additional Targeted Support and 
Improvement (ATSI).

to hiring the best staff available and to providing ongoing 
opportunities to support and increase professional practice for educators.  Teacher Induction Program (TIP) mentors, Peer 
Assistance Review (PAR) consulting teachers, peer mentors, and content spe
cialists work with teachers on a regular basis.  
Teachers, paraprofessionals, and administrators are all provided opportunities to participate in professional development 
(PD) programs.  An analysis of site academic and behavioral data is used to provide f

Student Achievement and used to guide the creation of the site professional development plan.  The site administrators 
and Professional Development Team (PDT) work together to establish the focus of site professiona
l development that 
takes place during weekly early release Collaboration Days. Additionally, the district provided 3 days of staff development

SBCUSD offers a variety of professional devel
opment opportunities to support the improvement of instructional practice.  
The goal of all professional development is to increase student proficiency in core subject areas. Targeted support is 
provided in the areas of culturally relevant instruction, str
ategies to assist English Learners, essential components of an 
ELD lesson, implementation of the Common Core State Standards, creating rigorous standards
-
aligned units of study, 
building a solid foundation in Algebra, GATE strategies, implementing Positive
 
Behavior Supports and integrating 
technology into daily instruction.

ces, including teaching to the 
appropriate depth of knowledge and disciplinary literacy.
 
 
Additionally, Special Education offers a variety of PD opportunities to support the Individual Education Plans (IEPs) of 
identified students. Professional development
 
is focused around current district, state, and national trends in the area of 
Special Education. At present, available topics include successful implementation of strategies for students with Autism, 
curriculum for different disability groups, behavior ma
nagement, data analysis, social skills, English Language 
Development (ELD), Behavior Support Plans (BSPs), and legally defensible documents that best support students and meet 
state requirements.
