About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Cal
ifornia is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational
 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data
 
reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.g
ov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community me
mbers should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

e committed on school 
campuses and at school related functions, identifying appropriate strategies and programs that will provide o
r maintain a high level of school safety, and 
addressing procedures for complying with existing laws related to school safety.
 
 
Fire drills are held at least twice a year at the secondary schools and once a month at the elementary schools. Disaster and 
ear
thquake drills are conducted 
as needed. Armada Elementary participates in the Great California Shakeout earthquake drill every fall in October and holds a
 
minimum of two Closed 
Campus drills per year.  The School Safety Plan also includes the MVUSD discipl
ine policy, which describes the consequences for student misconduct 
(such as detention, suspension, and expulsion).
