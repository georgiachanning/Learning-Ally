By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Students are at the center of our school, and our relationship with them drives all decisions made at Stone Ranch. Our 
initiatives include staff collaboration, curriculum alignment, implementation of California State Stand
ards, student goal 
setting, and focused intervention programs. Each of these initiatives has at its core the success of our students. We are 
about respecting and recognizing children, helping them learn, explore, and discover. Our vision is to provide educ
ational 
opportunities which will create self
-
directed students capable of succeeding in a rigorous, standards
-
based 
curriculum.
 
Our staff uses core curriculum resources, and creates standards based goals centered around students' 
individual and group needs
. To ensure that our students are prepared for college and other post
-
secondary success, we 
provide personalized learning by inspiring students to be self reliant problem
-
solvers who will achieve their fullest 
potential.
 
 
Through goal setting and encouragi
ng students to be actively involved in their education, we will build the foundation for 
them to be citizens who recognize that effort and persistence matter, and that their self
-
direction and initiative will make 
their learning relevant, valuable, and mea
ningful. All Trailblazers will be "college ready" and prepared for a range of 
opportunities and choices made available to them as they promote to middle school and beyond to pursue their individual 
interests and passions. To this extent, teachers build on 
students' prior knowledge, life experience, and interests to achieve 
learning goals. Instructional strategies will be adjusted to the needs of the students, with a focus on critical thinking ski
lls. 
Stone Ranch continues its tradition of focusing on studen
ts' reading
-
writing connection to provide self directed and 
reflective learning for all students.
 
 
Stone Ranch has a limited number of reportable sub
-
groups. Ethnically, overall our Asian (35%) and White (38%) 
populations are our significant subgroups. Our
 
students qualifying for Economic Aide (8%) is relatively small compared to 
the school.
 
Our designated English Learner student population is 20%. We provide an environment that fosters 
differentiation and meets the needs of all learners including English L
anguage Learners (ELL), Gifted and Talented 
Education (GATE), and Special Education (Speech and Language, RSP, OT, APE).
 
 
We an ASD Preschool class, RSP Integrated 
Preschool class and NSH Integrated Preschool class.
 
We
 
are proactive and offer early interve
ntion support programs, 
preschool, and
 
Transitional Kindergarten
 
(a two
-
year Kindergarten program), that help all of our children develop the 
language and foundational skills necessary to ensure academic success. Our
 
ELL
 
providers and Special Education tea
m 
work collaboratively with the classroom teachers and administration. We offer intervention support through our ELL 
program with two highly
-
qualified ELL aides, and
 
an equally qualified classroom teacher acting as our coordinator. As each 
ELL student has 
unique needs our students' ELPAC scores are accessed and instruction is provided in specific targeted 
areas of need. Progress is monitored throughout the school year. Targeted individualized instruction is at the forefront of 
closing the achievement gap fo
r all subgroups, as each student is first and foremost an individual.

We realize that the standards for English Language Arts includes Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing, and that 
developing this complete set of skills benefit all our students, and 
extending opportunities for our students to develop 
these language skills include a focus on oral presentations, extensive writing instruction, and student selected reading 
(combined with structured, standards based curriculum). Students write across the c
urriculum 
-
 
in all subject areas 
-
 
and 
recognize the reading
-
writing connection. They
 
are provided opportunities, in their class as well as cross
-
grade levels, to 
share their work and develop their public speaking skills.  Teachers collaboratively studied 
the key shifts in math focus 
impacting instruction so our students can: make sense of problems and persevere in solving them, reason abstractly and 
quantitatively, construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others, model with mathematics, use
 
appropriate 
tools strategically, attend to precision, look for and make use of structure, and look for and express regularity in repeated
 
reasoning.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Poway Unified School District ensures that stud
ents attend clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each of its schools is maintained in good repair.  A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices, and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and 
well maintained.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A night custodial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms, and offices daily.  
The district has adopted cleaning standards for all schools.  A summary of these standards is 
available at the district offices.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Stone Ranch 
supports "Parents as Partners" and recognizes the positive impact that parent participation has on student 
achievement. Our School Site Council consists of five parents and five Stone Ranch staff members, and meets to help 
determine the direction for our s
chool and endorse our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement each year. Our PTA meets 
monthly and is an integral part of our school's success. Focusing on the overall needs of every student, they support our 
learning community in a variety of ways. In additio
n to typical PTA activities such as helping in the workroom, classroom, 
and library, our PTA works in conjunction with our Stone Ranch Elementary School Foundation. The PTA also fundraises 
to support the purchase of instructional supplies,
 
our Art Corps Pr
ogram, Book Fair, Fun Run, and Fall "Round Up" Festival. 
The Foundation provides our school with funds for Instructional Aides
 
for our TK/Kindergarten classrooms, PE Instructional 
Aides, Impact Teachers for both intervention/challenge groups and release ti
me for teacher assessments.
 
 
 
 
Parents are a welcome part of our Stone Ranch Family and we celebrate their positive impact on our school community. 
We offer parent education seminars and encourage participation. These may
 
include Kindergarten Readiness, Ef
fective 
Communication, Positive Discipline, Managing Anxiety, Cyber Safety, and Parenting Skills. Additionally, we sponsor diverse 
programs which have been developed to enhance student achievement and character development at Stone Ranch

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Stone Ranch places a strong emphasis on the safety of students and staff.
 
Our emergency plan
 
is reviewed by our Safety 
Committee/Site Council
 
composed of teachers, parents,
 
and staff to ensure that they reflect the latest research and best 
safety practices
. Annual training on procedures and drills for intruders, fire, bus evacuation, and earthquakes are held at 
a variety of times and differing circumstances to help ensure that everyone on campus knows what to do in any emergency 
situation.  Maintenance, gro
unds, and custodial staff work with a scheduled prevention program to ensure that our 
campus is free of hazards and all equipment functions properly. We closely review our procedures and continue to fine 
tune our plan each school year to keep everyone safe
.
 
 
Our 2019
-
2020 Site Safety Plan goals included a continued focus on
 
education
 
to combat bullying and
 
teaching conflict 
resolution strategies to our students as well as implementation of closed campus safety procedures.
 
 
These goals are 
supported through 
teacher lessons, administrator assemblies with students, and a variety of additional assemblies and 
events throughout the school year.
  
We promote
 
"bucketfilling" and the positive use of kind words and actions filling the 
buckets of others.
 
 
We also celebr
ate Character Counts and Red Ribbon Week each year focusing attention on healthy life 
choices.
