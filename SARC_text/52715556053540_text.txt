-

-
4, 5
-
6, and 7
-
8 students. The school 
was first established at its present site in 1933. In 1997, a new facility was built with two classrooms, 
a multipurpose room, kitchen, bathrooms, and office. In 2007
-
08
, the school applied for a financial 
hardship from the state in order to construct two new modular classrooms and a larger 
multipurpose/kitchen. The new classrooms were completed in August 2008, but the 
multipurpose/kitchen was not completed until August 2
011.  Kirkwood School now has 5 
classrooms, 2 office rooms, and a large gym/multipurpose building with a kitchen and pantry.
 
 
The Kirkwood Family cultivates strong and confident citizens by providing access to academic, 
social, emotional and physical 
education in a safe environment.  Our Kirkwood community will have 
the courage to be accountable, engaged learners who foster respectful relationships and exhibit 
excellence through hard work and kindness.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
Teachers offer after school tutoring for all students that score basic or below on the State testing 
or who are struggling in a particular area.  
Teachers enroll in professional development 
opportunities for math and reading.
 
 
The school receives Title I and Title II,  all other categorical programs have been rolled into the new 
Local Control Funding Formula.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and 
comparisons of the school to the district
 
and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic 
system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Intern
et access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., 
the California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally 
provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use 
restrictions may include the hours of 
operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types 
of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is
 
required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies 
(LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported 
in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members shou
ld contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Kirkwood School was established at its present site in 1933. Kirkwood serves gradesTK
-
8 in a facility built in 1997. Kirkwood is located in a semi
-
rural area 
seven miles south of the city of Corning.
 
 
Kirkwood School
 
is maintained by a full time custodian/maintenance person. The maintenance person conducts monthly site inspections and makes
 
necessary repairs.
 
 
The school has 5 classrooms, a multipurpose room, kitchen, and office. The new building project consists of 2
 
of the classrooms, and a new multi
-
purpose 
building with a kitchen, pantry and restrooms. Custodian cleans daily after students leave. Classified staff and certificated
 
staff monitor students at all 
times.  The Tehama County Office of Education, SERRF pro
gram provides an after school program until 6:00 p.m.
 
 
The district applied for a financial hardship grant and state funding to fund 2 new classrooms and a larger multi
-
purpose building with kitchen and 
restrooms.  While the classrooms were operable in 200
8, the remainder of the project was held up due to lack of funding from the state.  The state 
released the funds in June 2010 and construction resumed with a completion in August 2011.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Prio
rity 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Asses
sments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standar
ds, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the Uni
versity of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
