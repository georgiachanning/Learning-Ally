By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditi
ons and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Cambridge Elementary school maintains a clean and safe school site. We have one full time day custodian and one full 
time night custodian to maintain our campus, while also holding our students accountable 
for maintaining their own 
personal clean environment at their desk and eating area. Minor repairs are made by our custodians, with larger repairs 
being maintained by the District Maintenance Support Staff. Providing a safe environment for our students is o
f 
paramount importance at Cambridge Elementary School.
 
 
Data reported are the determination of good repair as documented in a completed Interim Evaluation Instrument, 
including the school site inspection date. The school completes work orders and 
collaborates with the Maintenance 
department to address Items that are identified as fair and poor on the FIT report. The Custodian and Principal hold 
monthly inspections and report needed repairs.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula

32289, a Comprehensive 
Safe School Plan particular to their site. Each school site is required annually, by March 1st
, to have reviewed, and if 
necessary, updated their Safe School Plan. Each school forwards its Safe School Plan to the district through the office of 
Student and Community Services. The office of Student and Community Services provides plan development ass
istance to 
the schools and maintains a file of individual school plans available for inspection by the public.
 
A comprehensive disaster plan is in effect and fire and/or earthquake drills are conducted on a monthly basis. All schools 
in the district are li
nked through an emergency radio contact system, and district radio drills are held periodically to be 
prepared in case of an actual disaster. All staff members are assigned to specialized teams including the Command Center, 
Sweep and Rescue, First Aid, Ass
embly/Parent Assistance, and Security/Site Operations. These disaster procedures are 
outlined in detail in the School Site Disaster Plan.
 
As for student behavior and discipline, Cambridge students will be instructed in expectations for behavior in school 
c
ommon areas by the staff on the first day of school, with regular reminders and refreshers throughout the year. Common 
areas include walking in line, lunch area,  restrooms and playing on the yard.  A positive reward system will be put into 
place at the be
ginning of the year utilizing collecting Cubs Cash for tangible and behavioral rewards. Each teacher will 
share their discipline policies with parents at Back to School Night and in an information letter sent home at the beginning 
of the year.

time 
English Language Development Resource teacher supports classroom teachers and provides direct instruction for our 
English Learners.  English Language Development curriculum consists of McGraw
-
Hill Wonders. 
 
A full
-
time Community 
Assistant provides English Language support to parents and families.  Before
-
, during, and after
-
school interventions are 
provided for students that do not meet benchmark and are considered "at risk" in reading and math.  Materials t
o support 
student engagement and access the curriculum is purchased through Title 1 funds and LCFF funds. The PTA/PTO also 
provides funding for enrichment assemblies and programs.
 
 
Below is a list of things our stakeholders found to be the most important a
spects to spend our categorical funds on:
 
 
* Intervention programs for students not reading at grade level.
 
* Technology for the purpose of student learning (i.e. computers in the classroom, computers in the computer lab, 
computers for intervention program
s).
 
* Tutoring opportunities for our students not meeting grade level standards or not progressing in their English Language 
Proficiency.
 
* Teacher training and professional development opportunities in the area of best teaching practices and in meeting 
le
arning needs of ALL learners.
 
* Technology as a teaching tool (LCD Projectors, I
-
Pads, HP Stream student notebook computers, teacher laptops, SMART 
boards, etc.).
 
* All parents, including parents of English Learners, should be provided parent 
education opportunities to support their 
children at home (ex. Family STEM Night, School Smarts Parent Program, Parent/Community Nights/Events (e.g. Carnival, 
Trunk or Treat, Camp
-
out, etc.), Grade Level Specific Skills Class, Common Core Parent Informatio
n Classes, etc.).
 
* Staffing of personnel for the purpose of meeting the needs of our most intensive students needing extra academic 
and/or English language support (ex. Resource Teacher, Instructional Specialist, etc.).
 
* Providing bilingual support is im
portant in increasing school and parent communication for the purpose of increasing 
student achievement (ex. Bilingual Community Aides, Written and Oral interpretations, etc.).
 
* Resources to support our efforts for improved student attendance (ex. student
 
recognition certificates and awards).

Teachers are surveyed each year to help determine needed staff development based on review of student data on 
achievement.  Trainings have included the implementation of the Wonders English Language Arts 
curriculum.  Other 
professional development opportunities include data analysis, grade level collaboration opportunities to guide instruction, 
utilization of technology to support learning, student engagement and differentiation and appropriate scaffolding
 
of 
instruction. Response to Intervention training is also in place. Cambridge continues to focus on the Common Core State 
Standards (CCSS) and designing training in conjunction with OUSD to ensure all teachers are prepared to implement 
instructional strat
egies needed to enable success in each classroom throughout the school.  Teachers also have 
opportunities to attend conferences and workshops outside the district. In addition to the above
-
mentioned 
opportunities, staff development opportunities are provid
ed through CTIP (California Teacher Induction Program) for new 
teachers. Support is also provided by our instructional specialist, principal, and peer leaders to all staff as needed.  Staf
f 
meetings and grade level collaboration occur regularly to review c
urrent needs of the students based on data review.
 
 
At Cambridge Elementary, we had a number of surveys and input opportunities given to our parents, students, and 
teachers.  This stakeholder input gives us information about what is needed for our school, 
beyond just professional 
development to ensure all areas of instruction and needs are covered.
