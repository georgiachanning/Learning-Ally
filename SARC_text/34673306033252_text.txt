By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
School Vision and Mission:
 
The mission of Theodore Judah
 
is to engage, challenge and support students in mastering the content knowledge and 
social emotional skills necessary for a successful life.
 
 
The vision of Theodore Judah is a vibrant learning community that includes the Academy for Advanced Learning and 
our 
neighborhood students.  We develop as a Professional Learning Community and as such teachers collaborate to develop 
learning opportunities, including intervention and enrichment, to meet the needs of each student.  We use data, based 
on formative and s
ummative assessment of key standards, to drive and revise instruction.  We have a robust Positive 
Behavior Intervention and Support (PBIS) program and implement Responsive Classroom strategies to ensure that 
students, families, and staff experience school 
as a safe, welcoming, and joyful place to work and learn. We are dedicated 
to our mission and proud to work tirelessly to realize our vision.
 
 
School & Community Profile:
 
Folsom Cordova Unified School District is comprised of two communities located in Sac
ramento County along HWY 50.  
With a population of more than 19,500 students, schools are an average of twenty miles from downtown Sacramento and

A distinguishing characteristic of Theodore Judah is that in addition to serving our neighbor
hood community ("Core") we 
host the Academy for Advanced Learning ("Academy").  This Academy is a selective program that serves the needs of 
gifted and high
-
achieving students from throughout our district and surrounding areas.  There are currently two Aca
demy 
classes for each grade level, 1
-
5.
 
 
We currently have 2 kindergarten classes, 4 first grade (2 core 2 Academy) , 4.5 second grade (2.5 core and 2 Academy), 
4.5 third grade (2.5 core and 2 Academy), 3.5 fourth grade (1.5 core and 2 Academy), 3.5 fifth 
grade classes (1.5 core and 
2,Academy), and one learning center classroom.  We have a full time credentialed physical education teacher.  To help 
address the social
-
emotional needs of our students we have a school psychologist 1.5 days a week and a social 
worker 1
-
2 days a week.
 
 
Our curriculum is focused on teaching students the adopted California Common Core Standards in all grades.  Materials 
used in classrooms are state and district adopted materials.   We have Chromebooks for students to use in the cla
ssroom 
and are currently at a 1:1 ratio.
 
 
Parent participation is encouraged to foster a close, cooperative relationship between home and school. Our Parent 
Teacher Organization (PTO) is active, providing many activities and events for Theodore students an
d families. Our 
Schoolwires webpage keeps parents informed about schedules, events and activities happening at school. Teachers 
maintain their own page on our website which allows two way communication between teacher and parent and includes 
the ability fo
r a parent to check grades and attendance. Frequent communication, regular conferences and parent 
involvement in the classroom all help to build a positive learning environment.
 
 
At Theodore Judah we believe that relationships are an important part of a sc
hool culture. Theodore Judah has a very 
active community program where parents, high school students, senior citizens, business people, and faith
-
based 
organizations spend time volunteering in our classrooms. Many community organizations and businesses don
ate funds 
and time to our school. Each year Intel awards our school a monetary gift based on volunteer hours.  These funds are used 
to enhance our ability to offer outstanding programs and opportunities for all our student. Teachers collaborate together 
to
 
create a culture that is responsive, welcoming and enriching for all students.

who received 
scores.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State p
riority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We have a very 
large parent participation/ volunteering process where parents help organize and plan events that benefit 
children throughout the year. Our school's  Site Council consists of five parents who meet regularly with staff  to stay 
informed on school progress a
nd make decisions about changes . In addition our English Learners Acquisition committee 
(ELAC) meets twice per year to discuss to support English Learner (EL) learners.  Also we support families with training 
from Sacramento State. We also have our Theodo
re Judah ( TJ) JUMP program where we have 25 volunteers come and 
eat lunch with individual students.  Our STARS program has 50 students where the community comes in three days per 
week to support the social emotional well being as well as the academics wit
hin the classroom.
 
 
Parent involvement is essential to the academic success of children. Therefore, each year we allocate a portion of our 
budget to fund parent workshops and parent education.  Volunteers are encouraged to be involved in the classroom, on 
field trips, as well as other school wide events.
 
 
At Theodore Judah Elementary School, parent and community volunteers are welcome to help in classrooms and after
-
school activities. Some of the special events volunteers help make successful are the Family
 
Picnic, Santa's Breakfast, 
Harvest Carnival, Read Across America, Spelling Bee, the Family Dance, Family Math Night, Field Day, and Performance 
Night.  In the classrooms, volunteer help is invaluable for tutoring, clerical assistance, chaperoning field tr
ips, and providing 
an extra set of hands for projects.
 
 
Theodore Judah Elementary School welcomes and encourages volunteers.  Parents interested in volunteering their time 
should contact their child's teacher or the school office at 916
-
294
-
9175.  Parent v
olunteers are required to complete the 
volunteer application and will be advised on how to obtain a Tuberculosis test and go through the fingerprinting process 
through the District office.  Once cleared, volunteers will be notified and may begin volunteeri
ng at the school.
 
 
For additional information about organized opportunities for parent involvement at Theodore Judah Elementary School, 
please contact the school office, at (916) 294
