The
 
District
 
takes
 
great
 
efforts
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
all
 
schools
 
are
 
clean,
 
safe,
 
and
 
functional
 
for
 
our
 
high
 
educational
 
standards.
  
This
 
is
 
achieved
 
by
 
custodial
 
staff
 
adhering
 
to
 
district-wide
 
cleaning
 
standards.
  
In
 
addition,
 
a
 
work
 
order
 
process
 
was
 
developed
 
to
 
make
 
certain
 
that
 
timely
 
and
 
effective
 
maintenance
 
service
 
is
 
provided
 
and
 
that
 
emergency
 
repairs
 
are
 
given
 
the
 
highest
 
priority.
 
 
During
 
the
 
summer
 
of
 
2017,
 
Laurel
 
Creek
 
Elementary
 
received
 
over
 
$3.8
 
million
 
in
 
improvements
 
to
 
expand
 
the
 
site.
 
These
 
improvements
 
included
 
a
 
new
 
play
 
field
 
with
 
a
 
running/walking
 
track,
 
expanded
 
playground

and
 
shade

two
 
aging
 
portable
 
classrooms.
 
In
 
the
 
summer
 
of
 
2019,
 
the
 
site
 
received
 
new
 
HVAC
 
equipment.
  
No

is
 
tailored
 
to
 
the
 
specific
 
conditions
 
at
 
the
