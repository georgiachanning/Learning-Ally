 School Accountability Report Card
 Reported Using Data from the 2018
-19 School Year
 Published During 2019
-20   By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
   For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.  For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.  For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
  DataQuest
 DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).  Internet Access
 Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-come, first
-served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our vision at Mildred Perkins Elementary is that all students can learn at high levels when instruction meets their needs.
 
 
Mildred Perkins teachers, administrators and staff are committed to the continuous improvement of 
classroom 
instruction, organizational practices and site leadership to improve student learning. We are committed to providing 
students with opportunities to exceed their potential and a learning environment that supports all learners.
 
 
Mildred Perkins Ele
mentary open its doors to the community on July 1, 1980. In 2009 our board of education was faced 
with a difficult decision; our district had experienced declining enrollment over several consecutive years and could not 
fiscally sustain all elementary scho
ols operating under the Salida Union School District. Consequently Mildred Perkins 
Elementary was closed at the end of that school year. In the years following the closure, educational programs such as the 
Y.E.S. company (theater), Come Back Kids, and our 
own District's Independent Charter School benefited from the use of 
the facility's upkeep.
 
 
In the fall of 2016 it was feasible again to bring back our neighborhood school and open the doors for enrollment. Currently 
Mildred Perkins Elementary provides ser
vices to students ranging from Transitional Kindergarten to fifth grade. Mildred 
Perkins continues to serve the community with an enrollment of 321 students in addition to 81 students enrolled in 
Independence Charter School.
 
 
The vision of Mildred Perkins 
Elementary aligns to the vision that Salida Union School District and stake holders developed 
in 2010. The core vision is that all students can learn when instruction meets their needs. At Mildred Perkins elementary 
we are committed to the continuous impro
vement of classroom instruction, site leadership and organizational practices 
to improve student learning. One of our main strengths at Mildred Perkins Elementary is the collective capacity of the 
staff and our comprehensive academic program. Our academic 
program recognizes and addresses the needs of our diverse 
population and focuses consistently on student learning. Our goal is to equip all students with the skills they need to 
achieve proficiency in a rigorous academic program, promote responsible behavi
or and enhance students' self concept by 
establishing healthy relationships with peers and adults. In order to achieve our goal we constantly monitor student 
proficiency in all academic standards, we focus on academic tenacity and provide students with opp
ortunities to develop 
resiliency as well as social emotional skills.
 
 
Our goal at Mildred Perkins Elementary School is to support all students exceed their potential.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Impr

Our campus consists of four permanent buildings equipped with transferable interior walls that allow us to configure the 
shape and number of learning areas as needed.  We house a classroom equipped for science and one 
equipped for home 
economics, a multipurpose room with a fully
-
equipped stage, offices and storage rooms.  There are nine portable 
classrooms currently assigned to various grades.  Our facilities are maintained clean and in good working order by two 
custodi
ans whose shifts cover all hours of operation.  The site principal and custodians inspect all areas on a monthly basis 
and place requests for major repairs as needed.  Our district maintenance team prioritizes repair and maintenance 
requests and carries th
em out accordingly.  Our district grounds staff are responsible for maintaining our landscape clean 
and safe; maintenance is scheduled weekly and repairs are completed as needed.  Our students enjoy learning in a safe 
and clean environment.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Salida Union School District Safety committee reviews and updates the site Safety Plan.  The key elements of our 
School Safety Plan include:  Preparedness for emergency and natural disaster, awareness of the s
chool's physical and 
social environments, and expected characteristics of a safe school and school culture.  These elements are reviewed 
annually in a staff meeting with school personnel.  Parent/Student and Teacher handbooks are prepared and distributed 
t
o students and staff for their review on the first day of each school year.  The school handbook clearly outlines procedures 
and academic and behavioral expectations for students and families.  To adequately prepare teachers for emergencies, 
each classroom
 
is equipped with an emergency folder including parent contact information. Teachers have also been 
issued packs containing first aid supplies to wear during yard duty and on school field trips.  Additionally, safety procedur
es 
such as proper yard duty tec
hniques and enforcement of playground safety rules are reviewed during staff meetings 
throughout the school year.  Mildred Perkins is in the initial phase of implementing the Positive Behavior Intervention and 
Support framework to address the social/emotio
nal needs of students and to develop a community culture built on shared 

practice, earthquake preparedness drills and lock
-
down proce

preparedness bucket. This bucket contains the basic supplies that would be necessary to sustain a lengthy lock down on 
our school campus.  A copy of the Mildred Perkins School Safety Plan is availabl
e at our District Office for public review 
and on the district website at https://www.salida.k12.ca.us/domain/1552.

liaison for translations; Speech Ther
apist three days per week; Adaptive PE teacher; elementary PE teachers; elementary

These support personnel are funded through a co
mbination of resources including LCFF funding categories.  EL students 
receive daily English language development and reading intervention when identified. English learners receive reading 
intervention from a credentialed teacher. Curriculum includes but n
ot limited to Benchmark Advance, Footsteps2Brillance 
and iREADY are curricular resources utilized by our support staff to develop listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills
.  
The Learning Support Team provides push
