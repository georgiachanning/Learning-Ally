School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have 
successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Pa
rental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Site Council is a group of elected parents and staff members that provide input to help guide the administration 
and School Board in making policy
 

ional programs. They achieve this by giving input about  The 
School 
Plan
 
for Student Achievement. Each year the
 
Plan is updated and the School Site Council, which is comprised of four parents, two teachers, one classified staff, and the 
principal, examines
 
data to identify
 
areas of the educational program in need of improvement. From this list, several school goals are identified for the school 
year, along with the resources required
 
from the appropriate funding source to implement and achieve these 
goals.There are advisory committees which provide 
input to the Site Council to help develop
 
The Single School Plan for Student Achievement. The English Language Advisory Committee meets periodically to examine 
how our program can be enhanced to
 
better meet
 
the needs of English Learners within the District. Parents and committees provide valuable input to the Site 
Council that is crucial in helping them develop
 
strategy and budget  revenues to Programs.
 
 
The Parent Teacher Club is as an organization of dedic
ated parents that is instrumental in organizing and implementing a 
wide range of activities throughout the
 
school year and raising funds to provide equipment, field
-
trips and materials not covered by the budget. Events organized 
by the PT C include, the Fa
ll Carnival,
 
school dances, parent nights and many other special actives for our community. Requests are made by staff and the 
administration throughout the year for
 
special projects and materials which cannot be financed in the school site budget. PTC mem
bers can also volunteer to 

 
 
The Rio Bravo
-
Greeley Educational Foundation is a group of volunteers that have been instrumental in generating money 
to improve our technology goals.
 
The Educational Foundation. has been inv
olved  in identifying sources of funding, both institutional and private, to fund 
projects identified by the board. One of the
 
most recent projects funded by the Education Foundation was the donation of  the funds to purchase our Robotics 
competition pract
ice components.
 
With their generous donations we are able to provide our students with modern 21st Century classrooms.
 
 
Other organizations that give the parents the opportunity to become involved at school are the Sports Boosters and the 
Band Boosters. Bo
th organizations play a
 
key role in fund raising and event coordination for the athletic and music programs at Rio Bravo
-
Greeley. These 
organizations also provide parents the opportunity to get
 
personally involved with the students by coaching and 
helping with uniforms and equipment, and providing their 
assistance where it is needed. Both the music
 
and the athletic programs are outstanding for a school of our size and their organizations have played a key role in their 
success.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The school comprehensive safety plan was developed to assure a safe learning 
environment for our school community. 
The plan addresses disciplinary policies and
 
student programs that foster a nurturing educational environment. Discipline 
policies are discussed by staff, administration, and the Site Council at the end of each
 
year. A
djustments are made in policy 
and/or procedure upon consensus and the changes recorded in the
 
Safety Plan.The Plan also outlines procedures and a 
chain of command in the event of emergencies. Responsibilities have been assigned to the majority of the
 
staff
 
at the 
district and site level to assure coordinated efforts and a defined chain of command should an emergency situation 
occur.The Plan outlines specific steps to be followed during and an emergency.
 
 
School safety is a high priority for our school, in t
he case of emergency, all teachers' roles are clearly stated.  If we need 
to evacuate our campus, we have an offsite location arranged.  All secretaries and additional office staff will retrieve all 
student information cards so that we may contact all pare
nts and/or emergency contacts listed on the information card.

Our core 
program is augmented by a number of supplemental programs that benefit students with specific needs. We 
have a Response to Intervention (RTI) program for under
-
achieving students, a Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) 
program for high achieving students, 
a Limited English Proficiency (LEP) program for English Learners, and Special 
Education for students with learning challenges. In addition, RBG offers an elective called AVID which stands for 
Advancement Via Individual Determination. Students learn organiz
ational and study skills, work on critical thinking and 
asking probing questions, receive academic help from peers, and participate in enrichment and motivational activities 
which steer them on a path towards college.Our RTI program offers services to stud
ents in English Language Arts and 
Math. Students who are not at grade level in the subject  are eligible for the program and receive targeted instruction. 
Teachers meet frequently during PLC time to evaluate student data for RTI entrance and exit of studen
ts. We offer multiple 
sections of Reading Plus/Lexia, Math Intervention and Math Intensive (Tier 3) electives.
 
 
Our GATE program provides enrichment activities to gifted students who qualify in grades 6th through 8th. Our staff have 
been trained in differe
ntiated instruction to help the teachers modify instruction and assignments to accommodate those 
students that need more of a challenge as well as those struggling to master the curriculum. We feel that gifted students 
are gifted all the time and need the 
challenge throughout the day and the curriculum. The variety of electives also offer 
our GATE students a variety of choice and enrichment. These electives include: Science, Technology, Engineering and Math 
(STEM) electives, drama, coding, Spanish, French, 
band, choir, AVID, and art classes.
