By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Principal's Message
 
Delphic Elementary School is a small rural
 

nestled among many cow pastures. Delphic School was established in 1916 to provide an education for students living 



students living in neighboring school districts.
 
 
We are a kindergarten thr
ough eighth grade school with an average daily attendance of 61 students. Since Delphic School 
is small, we are able to provide a more personal educational program for our students. The school population is generally 
stable and, economically, lower

middle 
class. The economy is agriculture based, with some fading timber industry.
 
 
Delphic Elementary School is a coordinated
-
program school. Its mission is to create a learning environment of excellence
-
producing individuals with high standards that are inspired
 
to become lifelong learners and contributing members of our 
society.
 
 
A major role of Delphic School is to establish a caring, accepting school environment that helps build trust, foster the 

s ability to make wise and healthy decisions.
 
 

the traditional school program. This further promotes a positive perception of the 
classroom and school. Students come 
to regard school as a place where they are understood, thus, they become more motivated to learn.
 
 
We believe:
 

 
Children are our most important resource.
 

 

 

 
Education is the fo
undation of our country.
 

 
All people can learn.
 

 
People deserve the opportunity to reach their full potential in a clean, safe, nurturing environment.

High expectations
 
lead to greater achievement.
 

 
Self
-
worth is important for success.
 

 
People who are taught and allowed to succeed will continue to reach their potential.
 

 
People are responsible for their own behavior.
 

 
A balanced education contributes to the development of a 
whole person.
 

 
People must respect and accept individual differences.

Because parents are the only source of tra
nsportation for Delphic students, there is strong parental support and 
commitment. The school describes expectations for parent communications and involvement at the school, classroom 
and home levels. We are also committed to obtaining community resources 
for our school and invite all constituencies 
within our community to assist us in the education of our students.
 
 
A weekly bulletin lets the school community know what is happening at Delphic Elementary School. Our 
superintendent/principal and teachers con
fer with parents and address any problematic behaviors. Students are 
encouraged to be prompt and attend class every day. Efforts to improve attendance include daily phone calls, conferences 
and school attendance review board (SARB) letters to parents. Pare

regular attendance is essential to optimum learning, and attendance has improved.

School Safety
 
Delphic Elementary School has a Crisis Response file that includes its 
state
-
mandated comprehensive school
 
safety plan that meets state requirements as described in California Education Code Section 35294. The
 
safety plan is continually updated and includes disaster procedures, procedures for safe entry and exit of
 
students, 
procedures for serious disciplinary problems, a sexual harassment policy, child
-
abuse reporting
 
procedures, school dress codes, and school discipline policies. The school safety plan was last reviewed and
 
discussed with the school faculty and 
finalized in October 2017. This plan is currently under review and being updated by 
administration.
 
 
Adult supervision is provided in the classrooms, during recess and lunch, and in outside areas before and af
-
 
ter school. Under the direction of the superintendent/principal, specific school procedures are implemented
 
by the staff. One schoolwide disaster drill and monthly fire drills are conducted during the academic school
 
year. Visitors are requested to check i
n at the school office. To help ensure the safety of our students, students
 
are required to wait inside the school until the parent or guardian comes into the school to pick them up.
