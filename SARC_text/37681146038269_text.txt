School Description
 
La Paloma Elementary is a school of scholars, leaders, and professionals who work in collaboration 
to empower each student with the academic expertise, leadership, and personal growth that will 
prepare them for the college and career of their choice. Our s
chool was recognized by the California 
Department of Education as a Distinguished School in 2014 and as an Honor Roll School in 2015 
and 2017.  La Paloma is one of eight schools in the Fallbrook Union Elementary School District.  We 
serve an ethnically div
erse community in the northern part of San Diego County.  Approximately 34 
percent of the students who attend La Paloma speak English as a second language, and over 73 
percent come from families considered to be socioeconomically disadvantaged.
 
 
At La Palo
ma, we have established a culture of achievement for all by creating a school environment 
that embraces inclusion, leadership, intentional instruction, and meaningful engagement of all 
stakeholders on a beautiful, well
-
maintained campus.  To effectively se
rve our students with special 
needs, we have two learning centers and an Intensive Behavior Intervention program, at both the 
primary and intermediate levels.  The teachers in our special education programs work closely with 
our general education teachers 
to ensure our students in special education learn alongside their 
general education peers. In addition to intentionally creating a culture of inclusion, we work to 
develop the leadership skills of both students and adults. The Leader in Me program is infus
ed 
throughout our school culture in order to cultivate the personal leadership skills of students, and 
enhance the personal and professional leadership skills of our staff. In 2017 we were honored as a 
Lighthouse Leadership school by Franklin Covey.  An im
portant part of our leadership practice is for 
adults and students to work in concert to create and maintain learning environments that are 
inspiring and engaging.  Motivating leadership quotes adorn our halls and college flags are flown 
outside of each cl
assroom door. Our garden extends learning beyond the classroom walls. Inside 
the classroom, teachers are intentional about creating differentiated learning experiences that are 
engaging and responsive to the needs of each student.  In addition, a part
-
time
 
intervention / 
Language Academy teacher and 3 intervention technicians provide targeted instruction to ensure 
all students master the academic standard. In concert with differentiation, we personalize learning 
by using Thrively to identify and build upon 
the interests and strengths of our students. Children 
are not the only learners at La Paloma. Our teachers continuously refine their practice by 
participating in regular professional development and collaboration. Teachers are supported in 
their instructio
n of science, technology, engineering and mathematics with the assistance of our 
full
-
time STEM coach.  Technology is meaningfully integrated into teaching and learning through 
the use of Chromebooks, Discovery Education techbooks, and a well
-
appointed STE
M lab. We offer 
schoolwide enrichment programs through after
-
school clubs to expand the knowledge and 
experiences of our students.  In addition to educating students, La Paloma is a place of continuous 
learning and meaningful engagement for adults. Teacher
s meet in grade level teams three times 
weekly for focused collaboration.  Both certificated and classified employees regularly attend 
district
-
level professional development and outside conferences.  We educate parents through 
Parent Academies, and welcom
e all to share innovative ideas for our school through site councils 
and Coffee & Conversation with the Principal meetings. It is our vision that by creating a culture of 
achievement for all, we can develop individuals whose joy in learning, personal integ
rity, and 
compassionate leadership enable them to lead meaningful lives as contributing citizens in a 
changing, dynamic world.
 
 
Mission Statement:
 
To empower each student with the academic expertise, leadership, and personal growth that will 
prepare 
them for the college and career of their choice.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Pl
an
 
Each Fallbrook Union Elementary School District site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP), including a disaste
r preparedness plan 
annually. School administrators work closely with local law enforcement, fire department and/or the Provost 
Marshall's Office on Camp Pendleton who 
review the plans and also participate in emergency drills, provide feedback, attend site and district safety meetings and col
laboratively help to improve 
overall campus safety, climate, and security.  Copies of the C
omprehensive School Safety Plans are available for review at each school office. The plan 
includes emergency procedures for school safety, natural disasters, and campus intruders. It also contains appropriate strate
gies and programs that will 
provide or ma

afety. Students, 
teachers, and staff are trained to prepare for a wide range of emergency situations, and frequent drills help to r
efine emergency skills, policies, and 
procedures at all school sites. Following each drill, specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to co
ntinually improve emergency 
procedures, and improve campus safety.
 
 
Finally, school and distr
ict administrators immediately investigate threats of harm. Teachers and administrators seek to foster lines of open 
communication so students and parents feel comfortable reporting inappropriate activity including bullying, harassment, or th
reats. All FUE
SD staff take 
a strong stand against threatening behavior or bullying and investigate complaint matters fully. Many positive programs exist
 
districtwide to enhance 
and continually improve school culture and climate, including Positive Behavior Intervention
 
and Support, Restorative Practices, Suicide Prevention, Anti

Vaping Education and Trauma
-
Informed Practices.
