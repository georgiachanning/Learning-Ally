Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Brittan School is a rural Pre
-
K
-
8 school providing services for
 
approximately 460 students, 56% of who participate in the 
free or reduced lunch program. Brittan has an attendance rate of approximately 91%.
 
 
All students in Jump Start to Kindergarten through fifth grades are using the State adopted mathematics and  
rea
ding/language arts instructional programs.  Our philosophy  that guides the reading and math curriculum is based on 
differentiated instruction.. Teaching the same concepts and skills in many different ways provides both reinforcement and 
allows the curricu
lum to correspond to the learning strengths of each child.
 
 
Academic performance and a safe and orderly environment are standards strongly supported by the entire staff and the 
School Board. Budget, staffing and program decisions reflect these priorities. 
The student
-
teacher ration does not exceed 
25 to 1 in grades Jump Start To Kindergarten through third and an average of 27 to 1 in grades four through eight.  All 
students in grades
 
6
-
8 have 7 periods taught by teachers with either a single subject credent
ial or a supplemental credential.  The school has 
an extensive on
-
site library; a computer lab/technology coordinator; and a full
-
time clerical aide who services all grades.
 
 
The entire certificated staff has worked together to design an extensive research
 
based coordinated curriculum that 
defines basic skills, proficiency standards and student performance levels for all grades in all subjects. The Brittan School
 
Board has established teacher professional development programs as a priority to improve teache
r effectiveness.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
