By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
High expectations and strong support for student learning shape the culture that defines the character of Los Peñasquitos 
Elementary, where student success is the only option. As evidenced in the signs that dangle from our
 
halls, our students 
and staff believe every student will learn, whatever it takes. Los Peñasquitos School, in San Diego, California, is one of 
twenty
-
five elementary schools in the Poway Unified School District, and is proud to be celebrating close to 50 
years of 
enriching student lives. It is located in Rancho Peñasquitos, a community in northern San Diego County. We serve 535 
students from Pre
-
kindergarten to fifth grade. Our classes include an extended
-
day student academy for some of our 
fourth and fift
h grade classes. The students of Los Peñasquitos represent a cross
-
section of our community. Thirty
-
six 
percent of students receive free or reduced
-
price lunch, twenty
-
two percent of our children are English Language Learners, 
and there are over thirty
-
fiv
e different home languages at our school. At the same time, an ample percentage of the 
children come from middle and upper
-
middle class families. Economic and cultural diversity are strengths and we believe 
that our students benefit greatly from interactio
n with other students who share differences with them. The majority of 
our parents, including parents of second language students, are active in many aspects of school life. They serve on the 
School Site Council, help to organize events that celebrate the 
many cultures represented at our school, are members of 
the PTA, and are very involved in our volunteer organization. Los Peñasquitos values the diversity of our students and 
their families, and families in turn appreciate efforts made by our school to sup
port their children. Every decision we make 
is driven by our belief that all students will learn, whatever it takes. We accept no excuses for poor academic achievement, 
and are therefore committed to helping every child meet the high expectations represent
ed by our district's academic 
standards. The community is proud not only that Los Peñasquitos' students achieve well above national averages, but also 
that standardized and site
-
developed test scores reflect continuing and significant gains in student achi
evement. By most 
measures, student performance has shown consistent and impressive improvement. On the State of California's previous 
assessment system we achieved a statewide 10
-
10 ranking 9 times, which means we ranked in the top 10 percent of all 
school
s and also in the top 10 percent of schools with similar demographics. In the most recent administration of the 
current state assessments, the Smarter Balanced Summative Tests, eighty
-
two percent of our students met or exceeded 
the standard in English Lang
uage Arts and seventy percent met or exceeded the standard in Math. On the California 
Accountability System Dashboard, Los Pen students are in the blue part of the dial, 77.9 points above the standard on 
English Language Arts.
 
 
Also Los Peñasquitos student
s are 44.5 points above the standard in Math and in the blue part of 
the dial.
 
 
Los Pen has been recognized as a California Distinguished School, a National Blue Ribbon School, a Title I 
Academic Achievement School, and a Gold Ribbon School.
 
 
Our continued
 
growth as a professional learning community 

the commitment to academic excellence that is shared by our students, staff, and parents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Poway Unified School District ensures that students attend clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by the Sta
te of California to 
ensure that each of its schools is maintained in good repair.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices
 
and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and well maintained.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A night custodial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms and offices daily.  
The distric
t has adopted cleaning standards for all schools.  A summary of these standards is available at the district offices.

Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud

Elementary School recognizes the importance of the partnership between home and school and remains 
committed to supporting the Parents As Partners Core Value. We conduct a mandatory NEU Parent Forum detailing for 
parents the No Excuses University Approach
. Parenting classes are also offered as part of our Parent University on topics 
such as, Managing your Child's Behavior, Connecting with School, and Developing Capable and Responsible Young People. 
We have a Parent Resource Center that provides parents wit
h resources for managing the challenges of this important

Los 
Peñasquitos places strong emphasis on safety for students and staff. Emergency plans are reviewed frequently. Annual 
training procedures and drills for earthquakes, fire and bus evacuation are held. Our most recent Disaster Plan was

Each staff 
member has specific responsibilities during times of
 
emergency. In addition, maintenance staff works with a scheduled 
preventive program to offset costly repairs. The school has an up to date Asbestos Plan. Extended Student Services is 
available to students for before and after school childcare.
