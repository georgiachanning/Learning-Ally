School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Henry Miller Elementary School was named after Henry Miller, the famous cattle b
aron that owned most of the land 
around Los Banos in earlier years. The oldest section was built in 1953 and the new section in 1956. The campus occupies 
5 acres.   There are 14 permanent classrooms, 21 portables, 3 special service classes, an office, libr
ary, resource room, 
computer lab and an auditorium/kitchen on this campus.
 
 
Henry Miller School has an on
-


ry Miller staff values the diversity found at the school 
and believes that all children can learn. Henry Miller is committed to creating and maintaining a safe and caring learning 
environment, and to developing responsible students that can realize his or 
her best self.
 
 

skills that will prepare them for secondary and post
-
secondary education. To help us meet that, we have developed these
 
goals: 1. Work collaboratively by grade level and across grade level to improve student learning; 2. Ensure expertise 
through professional development opportunities; 3. Use research
-
based strategies (i.e. differentiated instruction, 
modeling, TPR, coopera
tive groups).

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Calif
ornia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

and math. Cert
ificated staff members participate in weekly grade level collaboration meetings in which teachers share 
instructional strategies and look at student data. Eight PLC or professional learning community meetings are held 
throughout the year to review benchmar
k data in ELA and math as well as to offer staff development in teaching 
methodologies. This is a commitment to our children to provide the best trained teachers for their academic success.
