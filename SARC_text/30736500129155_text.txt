By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Cypress Village Elementary School continues to be one of the newest elementary schools in the Irvine Unified School 
District
. We opened our doors for transitional kindergarten through grade 6 students on September 2, 2014. Cypress 
Village staff, in collaboration with our parents, students, and community partners, has created a broadly effective 
educational program that focuses 
on individual student needs.  In doing so Cypress Village Elementary  has created a sense 
of unity and pride among all stakeholders at our school, and has been recognized as a California Gold Ribbon School.  
Cypress Village is a neighborhood school that se
rves the immediate community, which is continuing to grow and expand.  
This year Cypress Village has been identified as a schoolwide Title I school.  Our parents value student achievement and 

rough our collaboration with our families and community 
partners that a positive school culture exists with targeted emphasis on a School

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: ELA and mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment and th

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number 
of students who met the standard 
(i.e., achieved Level 3

Goal 1:  To lessen traffic in the surrounding ne
ighborhood during arrival and dismissal. Objective: We will institute 
staggered arrival times with Upper Grade students arriving beginning at 7:45 am with classes starting at 8:00 am, while 
Primary Grade students preferred arrival time begins at 8:00 am wi
th class beginning at 8:15 am.
 
 
Goal 2:  To further secure our school campus, and to ensure that all adults on campus have been pre
-
screened, we have 

 
hours, 
beginning at 7:45 am and ending at 2:45 pm. It is our expectation that this will effectively address the issues of adults 
entering student restrooms during school hours.
 
 
Goal 3:  Our students and staff will continue to be safe in the event of a cr
isis. Objective: Safety team, in conjunction with 
administrative staff, and PTA will evaluate emergency supplies on
-
hand to ensure that, in the case of an emergency, 
adequate water, food, and other essential supplies will be available to support and sustai
n students and staff. Objective 
2: Staff will develop and practice plans for accurate and efficient accounting and reunification of students with parents in 
an emergency. Emergency Team will provide a structure/system to account for all student, and staff.
