Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in 
which data were collected:
 
December 2019
 
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 9, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursu
ant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned 
textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take h
ome. Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making 
the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all
 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.
 
The table displays informa
tion collected in December 2019 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education populati
on and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the re
quirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Edison School. The school is in compliance with all laws, rules, and 
regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. A safety plan was developed with the hel
p 
of students, parents, staff, and administration. The Safety Plan covers general safety and emergency procedures. The plan 
provides students and staff a means to ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. Components of the 
Comprehensive Safety Plan i
nclude teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, 
procedures for evacuation to and from the school, and the duties of classified/certificated staff members during an 
emergency. The plan is updated annually in the fall
 
and a copy of the plan is available to the public at the school office.
 
It is approved by the School Site Council and presented to the school board. This is usually done by the first board meeting 
in October.

As part of the growth process, opportunities for training and staff development are provided at both the district and 
individual school sites to 
administrators, teachers, and classified staff. The district holds four staff development days in 
August of each year.  These are contracted days for the teachers. An additional day was offered in January.  The trainings 
were part of the new curriculum ado
ption for math and language arts.  Additional training was offered for writing, social 
studies, science, active shooter, first aide, PBIS, and mandated reporting. Each site also holds quarterly instructional 
reviews, as well as intervention reviews to help
 
identify struggling students.
