By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
 
School Vision 
-
 
 
The vision at Shaffer Elementary School is to
 
create a school where family, staff, and the community work together to 
empower students to be successful, well
-
rounded, academically focused, global thinkers. 
 
 
Mission Statement
-
 
Shaffer Elementary School is committed to providing a solid foundation for
 
higher learning, with a focus on developing 
strong academic skills, outstanding character, and respect for diversity. 
 
 
Values and Beliefs:
 
We believe:
 

 
Children are our first priority.
 

 
Students should be encouraged to become lifelong learners and problem solvers.
 

 
Teaching should be innovative and creative in order to meet the unique needs and interests of students.
 

 
All students are capable of learning and are responsible and accountable 
for their academic performance and 
for their own behavior.
 

 

 

 
Students learn best in a safe, secure, and respectful environment.
 

 
Schools must have a consis
tent discipline program, which fosters student self
-
discipline and teaches and 
models expected behaviors.
 

 
Education is a shared responsibility. It is a partnership between home, school, and community.
 
Shaffer School is one of the oldest schools in the Atwa
ter Elementary School District. The original facility was built in 1957. 
The school is located in the agricultural heart of Central California's San Joaquin Valley in the city of Atwater, population
 
29,270, in Merced County. Our school is one of five TK
-
6 
schools in the Atwater Elementary School District and serves 
approximately 545 students in grades transitional kindergarten through sixth grade. In addition to the TK
-
6 program, we 
have a preschool class that provides services to 48 students and two county
 
special education classes with approximately 
24 students on our campus.
 
 
The culture is diverse at Shaffer Elementary School. Of the approximately 560 students, 87.9% of the students qualify to 
receive a free or reduced cost breakfast and lunch. Thirty
-
th
ree percent of the students are English Learners (EL), with an 
additional 14% of our students being reclassified English Learners (RFEP). Seventy percent of our students are Hispanic, 
16 % are Caucasian, 6.9 % are Asian, 3.6 % are African American, and all
 
other subgroups are less than three percent. 
Eleven percent of our students have an IEP.

The fluctuation of growth in our community over the years has challenged our facilities, resources, personnel and budget. 
Throughout all of this, an important goal 
of the Shaffer Community has been to maintain the atmosphere of a small school 
community with high standards. A part of this effort, our school began implementation of Positive Behavioral 
Interventions and Support (PBIS). As part of the PBIS work, we have 
created the Roadrunner Way 
-
 
Be Respectful, Be 
Responsible, and Be Ready to Learn. We also teach specific expectations for all areas of the school several times during 
the year. We have also implemented tier two strategies to support students who may be st
ruggling with behavior and 
need extra instruction in this area. Our hope is that when first entering the well
-
maintained campus, one immediately 
senses the caring, collaborative atmosphere that has become its trademark. A culture has been firmly establishe
d by the 
school community to work tirelessly, side by side, to maximize student academic and social growth.
 
 
The school staff strives to provide many positive extracurricular activities. We have an annual jog
-
a
-
thon fundraiser, Red 
Ribbon Week, Drug Store 
Project (6th grade), Student of the Month assemblies, and many grade level field trips.There are 
four (4) after school program classes with approximately 20 students in each classroom. There is also an after school 
Homework Club which has an enrollment of 
over 70 students. 
 
 
Parental Involvement is also important at Shaffer Elementary School. The school has an active School Site Council (SSC) 
and English Learner Advisory Committee. There is also a supportive Parent
-
Teacher Group that organizes Family Movie 
Nights and school t
-
shirt sales. We have held family evening events such as Family Coding Night and Family Reading Night. 
As a staff, we continually strive to engage parents in all educational activities. Surveys are sent out annually to all Shaff
er 
famili
es. The results are compiled as a part of the required needs assessments. The results have been shared with school 
staff, School Site Council, and the English Language Advisory Council to provide the basis for developing activities within 
the Title I schoo
l plan.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Shaffer was designed and built more than 50 years ago, but is fully accessible to students and others 
with disabilities 
because of its wide corridors, easy ramp access and multiple double
-
door entrance and exits. There are two clearly marked 
handicapped parking zones. Bathroom facilities have been made accessible and functional installing assistance side r
ails 
in designated bathroom stalls. Intercoms and telephones are located in each room of the school. Our noon duty personnel 
and yard duty teachers have instant communication with the office and each other as two
-
way radios are provided for 
them to assist 
in the needs of our students with physical disabilities. The District provides specialized bus transportation 
with wheelchair lifts as needed. An auditory trainer is provided for students with limited hearing, allowing full inclusion i
n 
classroom instructi
on.
 
 
The modernization project at Shaffer, a $1.2 million project, completed in the Summer of 2004, included upgrading the 
entire electrical system to handle the expansion of the school. The office was redesigned to install handicapped accessible 
restrooms
 
in the kindergarten classrooms and nurses station. New tile, sinks and lavatories were installed in the 
intermediate restrooms. Surveillance cameras were installed which will decrease vandalism and increase student/staff 
safety.

Regular maintenance has c
ontinued since the modernization project. During the summer of 2016, additional roofing was 
replaced, library carpet was replaced, and two classrooms and an additional restroom building were added. Each year 
since then, two rooms have had carpets replaced.
 
During the summer of 2019, the parking lot was expanded to 
accomodate increased needs, creating a safer and smoother flow of traffic.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud
y.

Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
A collaborative effort of our school family is our Safety Plan, written by students, staff and parents. An annual safety 
survey, a component of Effective Schools Survey, indicates there is a safe, clean, orderly environm
ent at our school. Shaffer 
has updated their school Safety Plan, which is required by law. The plan includes evacuation procedures and how students 
will be released in case of emergency.  The plan also includes all legally required components.   Copies of 
the plan are 
available to anyone who wishes one.
 
 
The custodial staff does an excellent job of keeping the grounds clean and safe for students. The school grounds and 
playground equipment are inspected by the custodian, principal, and maintenance staff on 
a regular basis.
 
 
Safety Plan was reviewed by both the Shaffer School Site Committee and the AESD School Board on October 8, 2019 and  
approved  by the AESD School Board on November 12, 2019.
