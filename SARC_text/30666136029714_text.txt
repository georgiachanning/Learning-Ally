By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
In November of 2016, the Ocean View 
School District (OVSD) passed Measure R, a general obligation bond, in the amount 
of 169 million dollars. This is the first bond that was ever passed in the 143 year history of OVSD. The bond program is 
designed to transform the aging fleet of 1960/1970 er
a schools into modern, contemporary learning environments. The 
bond program is currently in the planning stages with construction set to start in late June of 2018. The bond program is 
anticipated to take approximately eight years to complete ending somewh
ere in 2024/2025.
 
 
The District currently embraces a systematic approach to maintaining the current facilities to ensure that all schools are 
clean, safe, and provide an inspirational educational environment for our students to learn, grow, and to be challenged 
and inspired.
 
District maintenance and site custodial staff work in a coordinated manner to ensure that the repairs and 
operational items necessary to keep the schools in good condition are completed in a timely manner. A comprehensive 
work order system is being utiliz
ed by school and District staff to communicate both routine and non
-
routine maintenance 
requests. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority. 
 
 
From an operational perspective, the custodian inspects the facilities for safety hazards or other conditi
ons that need 
attention prior to students and staff entering school grounds. One full time day custodian and one or two part
-
time 
evening custodian(s) are assigned to each school site. The day custodian is responsible for:
 

 
Lunch area setup/cleanup
 

 
General 
grounds maintenance
 

 
Grounds keeping
 

 
Restroom cleaning
 
 
Restrooms are checked regularly throughout the day for cleanliness and subsequently cleaned as needed. The evening 
custodian is responsible for:

ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic
al education sequences or programs 
of study.

Ocean View School District has instructional priorities that 
are the focus for all professional development. Professional 
Development is collaboratively planned with the Ocean View Teacher's Association to ensure that it meets the needs of 
students and staff and that it aligns with the District priorities. There are
 
two full non
-
student professional development 
days each year. There are also four late starts for middle school and 5 modified Wednesdays for elementary schools that 
focus on site
-
specific needs. The first District professional development focus is on Dep
th
-
of
-
Knowledge (DOK)  levels 3 
and 4. Training is interactive and teachers worked collaboratively with colleagues to develop student demonstration 
lessons to implement throughout the school year. The second non
-
student training day focused on DOK. At midd
le school 
DOK 4 was revisited through the content areas and at elementary, DOK 4 was revisited through the lens of Next Generation 
Science Standards. OVSD is developing a Twilight Series of professional development that will be offered after school to 
sust
ain District initiatives such as: Write From the Beginning, Thinking Maps, Depth and Complexity icons, the Writing 
Continuum, and mathematical practices. As a District, we have a structure that allows us to stay the course and provide 
ongoing sustainable t
raining.

2) for reinforcement of or follow

3) follow
-

Sun View Elementary School offers support to new and veteran teachers 
through peer coaching and mentoring. 
Instructional aides and Title 1 teachers are provided targeted training focused on teaching strategies and curriculum 
content. Substitute teachers are invited to participate in designated staff development activities. A

-
related training from department
