Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Mission Campus as adequate classroom, staff and ancillary spaces which includes:
 

 
28 classrooms (sufficient for each class to have its own room)
 

 
A Staff Lounge with bathrooms
 

 
Workroom for teachers
 

 
Two areas for students to eat, a Multipurpose room and covered patio area for approximately 200 hundred 
students
 

 
9 bathrooms for students around campus
 

 
2 separate playgrounds for primary/upper each has its own field and a separate basketball area and 
grass area.
 
To promote safety, Mission Elementary School is a closed campus; gates are closed during the school day and visitors must 
enter through the main office to sign in at the front desk prior to entering school premises. Visitors must present their 
California ID, and staff must present their district badges. Mission Elementary School offers student supervision before 
school, during school and after school. Supervision in the mornings is done by the administrative team, support team and 
proctors. Rece
ss duty supervision is offered by teachers and proctors. Adult proctors supervise lunch and lunch recess. 
After school supervision is offered by the administration team, support staff as well as teachers.
 
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning 
standards for all schools in the district and Mission School is maintained 
in a manner that assures it is clean and in good working order. The principal works with the three
-
member custodial staff 
to develop cleaning schedules to ensure all classrooms, off
ices, and restrooms are cleaned daily, and restroom checks are 
done periodically throughout the day. Staff and students work together to maintain a clean and orderly school of which 
all can be proud.
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all sch
ools are clean, safe and functional. Site and district maintenance and 
grounds staff make sure that the work necessary to keep the school in good repair and aesthetically pleasing are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure eff
icient service and that emergency repairs related 
to staff and student safety are given the highest priority.
 
 

-
depth evaluation of each school to 
determine the condition o
f the facilities and identify situations that need maintenance, repair or an upgrade. There were 
no planned or completed facility improvements for the 2019
-
2020 school year. The district uses a facility survey 
instrument developed by the State of Californi
a Office of Public School Construction to assist with the data gathering 
during the inspections. All findings are shared with the principal and work orders for needed repairs are created at that 
time. The results of this survey are available at the school 
office or the district office. The state inspection mandated under 
the Williams Settlement was last completed August 30, 2019. The report was forwarded to the Superintendent of Schools. 
No areas of concern or deficiencies were noted by the team.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Mission has had a long history of strong parent and community relations. Our School Site Council (SSC) is committed to 
working collaboratively on shared decision making at Mission School. The SSC at Mission School represents the entire 
school community and
 
must approve the use of school improvement funds, school based coordinated plan, curriculum, 
budgets, and the multitude of other things needed to provide a successful learning environment for the students. Mission 
School encourages parents and other membe
rs of our community to share their time, knowledge, and abilities, with our 
students. The Mission SELPAC seeks to inform parents of school and district programs and actively seeks to advise the 
school staff on concerns that pertain to Mission English Learn
ers. Other than the SSC and SELPAC meetings, Mission School 
will continue to provide a number of parent workshops throughout the year that will focus on parenting skills, homework, 
discipline and working collaboratively with the school. Parent workshops ar
e generally offered every Tuesday and 
Thursday mornings, as well as some Monday afternoons. All workshops are offered in English and Spanish and the school 
provides childcare to further encourage parent participation. Parent Involvement Contact Person: Rho
