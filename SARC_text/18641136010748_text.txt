By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Guiding Principle
 
We will Achieve Academic and Social Su
ccess for All Students
 
 
Mission Statement
 
The Johnstonville Elementary School District, in partnership with parents and community, will ensure that all students are 
competent in the basic skill areas, demonstrate continuous achievement toward educational 
excellence, and reach their 
highest potential as productive, responsible citizens.
 
 
 
Message from the Superintendent:
 
 
Dear Johnstonville School Community
,
 
 
The 2019
-
20 school year will be an exciting new year for our community, including our 
parents and families, our staff and 
most of all, our students.
 
 
We utilize a robust student achievement and assessment system that informs our educational decision making process. 
This system allows us to identify the type(s) of support each student needs.
 
Students are assessed using multiple 
assessments on a regular basis so the public, board members, parents, teachers, and the students themselves know 
exactly what the students know in Reading, Mathematics, Language Arts, and Science. Our dramatic increase
s in both 
English Language Arts and Math, as recorded by the SBAC assessment, demonstrates the hard work and dedication our 
staff has to student achievement.
 
 
Johnstonville Elementary staff strive to create an academically rigorous and safe environment to 
help all students 
maximize their learning potential. As a small school, we are able to get to know each student and work with their family 
to help our students achieve success.
 
 
We welcome you to come visit our school, walk the campus, and observe teaching
 
and learning!
 
 
Scott Smith, Superintendent/Principal

obviously impacts the effort needed to maintain a clean and safe envi
ronment for our students. Our staff members, 
especially our custodial and maintenance personnel, deserve commendations on their ability to create a safe, comfortable 
learning environment for our staff and students. A large gymnasium was added to our school
 
site in 2008 and has become 
a source of pride for our school and community. This facility is used by our students, Lassen Hoops, and other community 
organizations every week. The addition of the gymnasium has filled a community
-
wide need for recreational 
facilities.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We recognize that parents are essential partners in the education of their student. We want to foster a positive and 
welcoming school environment for all our community stakeholders, especially our parents and families. As such, we have 
a variety of opportu
nities for parents and families to become involved. Some of these opportunities include: 
 
 
Thursday Communication Folders
 
Each Thursday a weekly communication folder is sent home with students announcing important activities and 
information.
 
 
School Site 
Council (SSC)
 
The School Site Council (SSC)/District Advisory Committee works in a variety of capacities to help shape how we educate 
our students. The council helps develop the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), the school's overall budget, ou
r 
parent engagement policy, the student
-
parent
-
school compact, and our school safety plan. In addition the council also 
helps evaluate student achievement data in an effort to identify steps that should be taken to help those students who 
are struggling ac
ademically.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Student safety is a top priority at Johnstonville Elementary School. We strive to establish and maintain a safe, healthy, and
 
positive school 
environment. Students and staff regularly review good safety practices and rules for responsible behavior 
in classes and on the playground. We maintain a closed campus and require all visitors to report to the front door of the 

 
pass. The School Site Council, our staff, and Susan River Volunteer Fire Department review our 
School Safety Plan on an annual basis. This plan includes procedures for emergencies, exit routes, parent pick
-
up during 
emergencies, and location of emergency 
supplies. A copy of this plan is kept in the office for parent review. Fire, 
earthquake, and/or intruder
-
on
-
campus drills are practiced on a regular basis. The school has a part
-
time nurse and school 
psychologist. Staff utilize two way radios for effective
 
communication at recess, emergency drills/events, and coordinating 
student pick
-
up for unplanned/emergency early school closures. The school has a zero tolerance policy on illegal drugs, 
weapons and bullying/cyberbullying. The School Board is informed whe
n a student is in possession of a weapon, and 
suspension/expulsion may be recommended.

Number of school days dedicated to St
aff Development and Continuous Improvement

Johnstonville Elementary School teachers attend professional development events throughout the year to look at 
California State Standards best practices, student achievement data, and the 
exploration of evidence
-
based ideas that 
assist in the improvement of classroom instruction. All staff returned to school two days prior to the first day of school. 
These two days were dedicated to professional development in the areas of multi
-
tiered syst
em of support, recognizing 
potential signs of suicide, the California State Math Standards and the Next Generation of Science Standards (NGSS). In 

y of topics 
including assessment strategies, student achievement data and grade
-
level instructional strategies. In addition, one 
Tuesday a month continues to be dedicated to a specific topic that teachers have expressed interest. These topics have 
included
 
higher order question techniques, google classroom applications, interim SBAC utilization, and the development 
of effective interventions.
 
 
What are the primary/major areas of focus for staff development and specifically how were they selected? For exampl
e, 
were student achievement data used to determine the need for professional development in reading instruction?
 
There are two primary areas of focus for staff development. This first is the development and implementation of effective 
rigorous academic ins
truction. The second area of focus in the development of successful interventions to help those 
students who struggle academically. These two areas of focus came from reviewing both formative and summative 
assessment data.
 
 
What are the methods by which pr
ofessional development is delivered (e.g., after
-
school workshops, conference 
attendance, individual mentoring, etc.)?

Professional development is delivered throughout the year in various settings. Before school starts, professional 
development is provided
 
through all
-
staff professional development days. On these days, staff engages in a conference
-
like setting, moving through a series of workshops that are focused on the professional development goals set out by the 
LCAP. Additionally, professional develop
ment is provided during Tuesday afternoon PLC meetings that are typically led by 
grade
-
level team leaders.
 
 
How are teachers supported during implementation (e.g., through in
-
class coaching, teacher
-
principal meetings, student 
performance data reporting, e
tc.)?
 
 
Teachers are supported in a variety of ways during implementation of our LCAP professional development goals. On 
Tuesday afternoon PLC meetings, the grade
-
level leaders run protocols, meet individually with teachers and provide 
supporting materials a
s teachers engage in this learning. In addition, district and school personnel continue to review 
professional development opportunities that support the LCAP goals.
