School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Harrison Educational Community is comprised of students, teachers, support staff and other community members 
who work collaboratively as a life long learning Community. Our goal is to serve all of our students every da
y, to promote 
high levels of student achievement while fostering an enriching, safe environment of mutual respect where all members 
are valued.  We provide a rigorous curriculum in all subject areas based on the California Common Core State Standards 
to en
sure all students can face change and success effectively and confidently.
 
 
 
All Kindergarten students have access to tablets and iPods. In Grades TK
-
6th  students have Chromebooks, which are used 
to access Accelerated Reader, Lexia, Reading Plus, DreamBox
 
(math), Mystery Science, Starfall, and coding software.
 
 
All software is aligned to the California Common Core Standards and are designed to provide students with the opportunity 
to develop and enhance their skills in English Language Arts, Mathematics, a
nd Science. Students have access to 
personalized software seven days a week.  Teachers monitor each student's progress through their personalized pacing 
guide.  Should the need arise, students are seen individually or in small groups to reteach specific sk
ills that they have not 
been able to master via the respective software programs.    Students are recognized on a monthly basis as they excel at 
their own pace.  Passing each level demonstrates mastery of specific English Language Arts and Mathematics skil
ls.  The 
software programs are designed to allow student's review of materials from previous grades as well as opportunities to 
move beyond their current grade level material.
 
 
All grade levels will participate in "Coding Classes."  In the previous three y
ears only our grade levels in third, fourth, fifth 
and sixth grades participated in opportunities to develop coding skills.  However, all of Harrison's  teachers have received 
staff development on offering coding to primary students and we have purchased g
rade
-
level coding materials.  This is an 
exciting opportunity for our students.
 
 
Harrison is a "Google Expedition" site.  All grade levels will be participating in the use of Google Expedition journeys.  
Harrison has their own class set of Google Expeditio
n equipment, thus allowing grade level teams to identify and utilize 
"Expeditions" that support any relevant curricular area and allow students to experience it up close.  Students and staff 
are excited to access this equipment and provide this experience 
for students to enhance their learning opportunities.
 
 
Harrison students are incentivised and recieve recognition for Accelerated Reading, and Hundred Mile Club.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
incl
udes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. 
Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilitie
s); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
