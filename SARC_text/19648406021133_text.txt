School Description
 
Welcome to Moffitt Elementary School, where we are proud to 
create a climate and curriculum 
that ensures academic rigor and consistency in all grade levels from kindergarten to fifth grade. Our 
students receive a well
-
rounded education and we value creating a culture that is inviting to all. 
Our school is very invo
lved and supportive of our District Literacy Initiative to improve learning for 
all students and the implementation of the new Common Core State Standards. Our primary focus 
is the implementation of the California Common Core State Standards and the transi
tion to the 
technology based CAASPP Assessments. In addition, our teachers implement reading strategies and 
techniques such as read aloud, shared reading, guided reading and independent reading with 
conferring in order to help students understand and make 
meaning of text. This learning crossed 
over into other areas of the curriculum such as math, writing, and history/social science to support 
student achievement.
 
 
 
Our mission is to improve student achievement through effective teaching practices, which we 
are 
constantly improving through staff development. We utilize district
-
trained literacy coaches who 
work collaboratively with the principal to ensure that all teachers are receiving training to 
implement effective teaching practices. We are proud that our
 
students are demonstrating 
academic growth and are developing a deeper love of reading. We are also pleased to support our 
English Language Learners through the inclusion of ELD in our daily schedules.  Our staff has also 
received additional training and 
professional development in the area and ELD and ALD provided 
through release time on site during the year.
 
 
The academic success and well being of students is at the core of our teaching. We are committed 
to developing our students into literate, problem
-
solving decision makers. We monitor and re
-
evaluate all programs yearly by reviewing and analyzing multiple sources of data. It is our goal and 
intent to ensure that all students are receiving a high
-
quality and equitable education in a positive 
and produc
tive environment.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of 
study

Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Moffitt Elementary values our parents. We encourage active participation by all and ask our parents to support the success of
 
our students by holding 
high expectations, participating in the educational process and par
ticipating in school wide events and activities. Our parents have the opportunity to 
participate in the decision
-
making process through the following school
-
wide committees: the School Site Council, ELAC, Student Success/CAPSS Team, 
PTA, and also as parent
 
volunteers in the classroom. Committees focus on issues and strategies to align the School Plan with the California Common Co
re 
State Standards and to make recommendations or assess school and student needs. The Student Success /CAPSS Team meets monthly
 
t
o discuss 
interventions and strategies for at
-
risk students and to assist teachers and parents with the student prior to formal assessment. Moffitt offered several 
parent education classes during the 2018
-
2019 school year.
 
 
The principal also offered two t
rainings during the year, focused on Common Core Standards 
and SBAC Assessment. Parents are encouraged to attend Back
-
to
-
School Night, Family Nights, Open House, Playworks Olympics, parent
-
teacher 
conferences, and to serve as chaperones on study trips. For
 
information about getting involved at our school, please call (562) 210

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Providing a safe environment is a top priority for our staff. We maintain a secure campus. During the 2014
-
2015 school year, Moffitt's campus had a 
monitored security gate installed at the ma
in entrance of the school. Once classes have started of each day, all gates are locked. Parents and visitors 
must use the gate entry system to gain access to the campus. Once on campus, all visitors are asked to report to the school's
 
office to sign in and
 
are 
given an identifying visitor's badge. Adult supervision is provided in the classrooms and outside areas before and after scho
ol, during recess and lunch, 
and during passing time between classes. Each year we review and revise our School Safety Plan, w
hich meets state requirements as described in the 
California Education Code. The safety plan includes disaster procedures and procedures for safe entry and exit of students. T
he School Safe Plan is 
reviewed, revised and approved by our School Site Council.
 
In addition, we share the plan with all staff during a school
-
wide staff meeting and make the 
plan available for review in the school's main office. We practice fire, earthquake and lock
-
down drills on a regular basis and hold training for staff on an 
as
-
needed basis. Teachers regularly review the rules for safe, responsible behavior in school and on the playground with student
s. In addition, the district 
office supports the school by reviewing and disseminating safety requirements and information, coordin
ating safety
-
related services, and providing 
training and assistance.
