By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-

Penngrove School is one of seven elementary schools in the Petaluma City Elementary School District. It is the oldest of 
the elementary campuses, having been founded in 1926, and is located on a hill overlooking the rural 
community of 
Penngrove. Penngrove School started as an independent school district, but unified with Petaluma Elementary District in 
the 1950s. The school colors are blue and yellow and the mascot is a panther, named Penny McPanther.
 
 
Penngrove Elementary 
School serves students in transitional kindergarten through sixth grade. Our staff includes 21 full 
and part
-
time teachers, as well as 17 members of our support staff. Our school provides a comprehensive program for all 
students, which includes language ar
ts, math, science, social studies, physical education, STEM (science, technology, 
engineering, mathematics), GEE (garden and environmental education) music and art. A variety of support services are 
provided to ensure all students meet grade level standard
s. Support services include two part time speech and language 
specialists, two full time resource specialists, a half time reading specialist, a part time guidance counselor, and six 
instructional assistants. Students receive support services based on iden
tified needs.
 
 
Penngrove Elementary School has a large multipurpose room, 18 classrooms, a spacious playground with grassy fields for 
games, a sports track, and a separate TK/kindergarten playground. The classic original building has been modernized and 
ma
de earthquake compliant. This building houses the office, library, technology center, learning center, Mentor Me office, 
guidance office, an After
-
School program space currently run by the YMCA, and some smaller learning spaces. The campus 
is clean and bea
utifully planted with flowers and shrubs. Student artwork and inspirational messaging can be found all 
across campus in a variety of spaces.
 
 
The mission of Penngrove School is to develop a community of learners who are dynamic communicators, creators, cri
tical 
thinkers, and collaborators as determined by the 21st Century Framework. We commit to a collaborative effort among 
staff, parents, and the community to motivate our students to reach high academic standards and to become exemplary 
citizens of our eve
r
-
changing world.
 
 
The vision of Penngrove School is to become a community of learners where students, staff, parents, and the community 
are intentionally working together as teams with the purpose of promoting strong academic success while valuing the 
uni
que nature of each individual. In order to prepare our students for their future, we will infuse technology throughout 
our classrooms as a tool for teaching and learning. We are dedicated to excellence and committed to nurturing our 
students to develop soc
ial, emotional, and physical growth in a safe and supportive environment.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019

Parents are an integral part of the Penngrove School program. We encourage parents to support the learning taking place 
in the classroom by volunteering regularly and actively engaging in meaningful parent/student conversations about 
learning. Additionally
, we encourage parents to attend field trips, family fun nights, community events, and to participate 
in Parent Teacher Association (PTA), the School Site Council (SSC) or the Bilingual Advisory program.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety is our number one priority at Penngrove School.
 
 
The School Safety Plan includes a school crime assessment, information about child abuse reporting, disaster procedures, 
information about our school
-
wide behavior program, procedures to no
tify teachers of dangerous pupils, sexual 
harassment policy, and information about supervision of students. The School Safety Plan is reviewed, updated, and 
discussed with school faculty annually.
 
 
Our teachers ensure that each student is part of our schoo
l community through classroom meetings, discussions where 

(1) Be Safe, (2) Be Respectful, and (3) Be Responsible. The staff at Penn
grove believes that having students who are 
engaged in their learning and invested in their school will result in a safe school.
 
 
Penngrove has a clearly defined Emergency Response Plan. We have a district nurse on staff to assist with health and 
safety issues and some staff members are trained in First Aid and CPR. Staff and students practice simulated emergency 
response drills. Penngrove holds monthly emergency drills (fire, earthquake, and lockdown) to ensure that we are 
prepared in case of an a
ctual emergency.
 
 
Penngrove complies with California Education Code and all District discipline policies to maintain a bully
-
free and safe 
campus.
 
 
Visitors to Penngrove must sign in and get a guest badge in the school office. The Sonoma County Sheriff is 
responsive to 
calls and provides consultation in the areas of safety and violence prevention. Our custodial staff does an excellent job of 
maintaining a clean and safe facility. Penngrove students and staff take pride in keeping our school clean.
 
 
The Comp
rehensive School Safety Plan for Penngrove is reviewed annually and amended as needed with the approval of 
the School Site Council.

the campus. Reading events have been s
cheduled throughout the year and are being carried out by students, staff, and 
families.
