By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

esent, and make 

 
 
Marina Village School is located north of Highway 50 in El Dorado Hills. The school is 37 years old. It is a 
sixth/seventh/eighth grade school with an enrollment of 829 students. Marina Village is one
 
of seven schools in the 
District.  Marina Village has a trimester schedule which provides students with more enrichment choices than on a 
semester schedule. Progress reports are mailed home shortly after the middle of each trimester. Grades are mailed hom
e 
at the end of each trimester.
 
 
Marina Village has established a reputation for academic excellence. There are grade requirements for participating in 
extracurricular activities. The staff has high expectations for quality work from students. Each student
 
can expect to be 
treated fairly, to work and play in a safe environment, to be challenged, and to be properly instructed and evaluated by 
competent, caring teachers.
 
 
Students with special needs are provided special help through several support programs. 
The Resource Specialist Program 
provides help for students in the areas of mathematics, reading and language arts. This support is provided by direct 
instruction, collaboration with the classroom teacher, and team teaching. Class size is small to allow for
 
individual 
attention.  Additional support is provided by a school counselor, a district nurse (1 day per week), a district psychologist 
(4 days per week), and a county speech/language specialist (2 days per week). Services include academic counseling, cri
sis 
intervention, and referrals to outside agencies. Tutorial instruction is available before school, during lunch periods, and 
after school through the Homework Club program for those students in need of extra help. A mandatory assignment to 
Homework Club
 
is provided for students who are academically failing. Marina Village teachers work closely with the 
support staff.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents and students consistently provide feedback indicating that Marina Village promotes a positive learning 
environment and that students are challenged in all academic areas. Positive behavior and achievement are recognized in 
numerous ways. Staff members nominate students for "Student Recognition" at the end of every trimester. These 
students are acknowledged for their special achievement at school assemblies. Teachers provide tickets for outstanding 
behavior (Ohana Tickets and
 
Mustang Pride Tickets) that may be redeemed for prizes and are entered into monthly 
drawings. Academic achievement is recognized through Honor Roll and Principal's Honor Roll awards each trimester; and 
the school's chapter of Honor Society. 8th
-
grade stud
ents are eligible for the Mustang Pride Award for academic 
excellence over 3 years and are awarded at 8th
-
grade promotion.
 
 
High expectations for student citizenship are an important part of the Marina Village climate. All students participate in a 
merit s
ystem that encourages appropriate behavior and results in merit deductions and disciplinary action as a 
consequence of poor behavioral choices. Students who complete each trimester with a full complement of merits are 
rewarded with an educational assembly.
 
Students who do not qualify for the assembly may participate in alternative 
activities to help them to learn about personal responsibility and positive choices. The school counselor also provides 
presentations to all students in behavioral areas that are 
a concern and school
-
wide assemblies provide additional 
instruction in behavior areas such as bullying, cyber safety, substance abuse, and student interactions.
 
 

ve positively influenced 

Village has implemented several programs to improve the climate and help students feel more connected to the sc
hool 
and their community.
 
 
The WEB program (Where Everybody Belongs) is made up of 8th graders who plan activities with 6th graders to help them 
with their transition to middle school. Marina has implemented a PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention and Suppo
rts) 
program to teach student behavior expectations, to recognize positive choices, and to provide support services for 
students. A variety of clubs meet after school, offering opportunities for positive social interaction. Marina students are 
involved in 
anti
-
drug, anti
-
tobacco, environmental, and community service activities.  Marina Village students function in 
a safe, positive environment. Marina Village recognizes that positive behavior and appropriate activities will stimulate a 
healthy, productive sc
hool climate.
 
 
A Site Safety Committee meets as part of the School Site Council to update the School Safety Plan and identify areas of 
need.  Eagle Scout projects and community outdoor workdays are scheduled to improve facilities.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
All Rescue schools receive equal allocations, per student, of LCFF Base Funding.  This funding helps support students by 
providing instructional materials, supplies and other 
needs.  Funding for support services, such as maintenance of buildings 
and grounds, utilities, and student transportation, is budgeted for at the district level and provided to each school site 
based on the varying needs of the individual school.
 
 
In addit
ion to the Base Funding described above, schools in the Rescue Union School District receive Supplemental funding 
roughly proportional to the number of unduplicated pupils (English Learners, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged, and 
Foster/Homeless Youth) they 
serve.  Furthermore, school sites receive allocations from other state and federal categorical 
programs, including Title I and Title II.  The purpose of these categorical programs range from improving the quality of the 
total instructional program for all 
students to addressing the unique needs of special groups of students.

Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Early Release Professional Development/Teacher Collaboration days are scheduled each Wednesday throughout the 
school year.  During these meetings, teachers work to analyze assessment data and target key standards.  In 
addition, they 
plan, develop and improve effective instructional strategies.  Staff development related to instructional practices, 
curriculum, technology, Common Core State Standards, and other educationally related matters are provided for all 
teachers.
 
 
Teachers receive professional development and will work collaboratively on a regular, ongoing basis to target key 
standards, analyze formative assessment data and develop appropriate instructional practices.
 
 
At the middle schools, minimum days are provid
ed for departmental collaboration, parent conferences, report card 
preparation, and middle school/high school departmental articulation.
