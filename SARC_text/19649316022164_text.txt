Since November 1988, state law has required all public schools receiving state funding to prepare 
and distribute a School Accountability Report Card or SARC. The purpose of the report card is to 
provide parents and the community with important information 
about each public school. A SARC 
is also a way for a school to report on its progress in achieving goals. It is with great honor and 
pleasure that I present to you the School Accountability Report Card for Emma W. Shuey 
Elementary School.

.
The Wonders English language arts program, which is published by MacMillan McGraw Hill, and Go Math, which is published by Ho
ughton 
Mifflin 
Harcourt, are implemented schoolwide. Working in conjunction with the ELD teacher, every grade level has a 30
-
minute designated 
ELD/intervention block, and students are leveled according to need. All students in grades K
-
6 use the iReady adaptive online pr
ogram in 
reading and math. iReady assesses students up to four times a year, and based on the assessment, lessons are implemented at t
he 

 
-
 
9:30. The 
principal and teachers have structured these meetings so that they follow agreed upon norms, and meeting topics are divided i
nto grade 
level collaboration, planning, and staff meetings. 
 
 
Parents are given opportunities to learn about Common C
ore State Standards at parent meetings, at Back
-
to
-
School Night and during 
parent
-
teacher conferences. Parent meetings are held throughout the year to inform and update parents on the Common Core standards, 
Title I policies, school budget, school safety an
d also state
-
mandated assessments. Translation and child care are provided, and meetings 
are held in the evenings and mornings. However, parent attendance at these meetings continue to remain low. Incentives such a
s free 
dress coupons or homework passes ha
ve helped to improve parent attendance. In light of the low parent participation, Shuey School has 
re
-

take into 
consideration paren
t needs and work schedules. The Welcome Back Fair is a one
-
stop shop for parents to complete all the required 

rent Power 
Hour is a 
one
-
hour period where parents can spend time with their children in their classrooms learning with their child. Both events have 
had high parent attendance and enthusiasm. 
 
 
Academic excellence works in tandem with a positive school culture and an effectiv
e discipline plan. Explicit instruction in behavior 
expectations is conducted through a Welcome Back Assembly and a PBIS launch. Students take responsibility for the school by a
pplying 
for leadership roles and making recommendations through a suggestion bo
x. Student Lighthouse, comparable to Student Council, includes 
representatives from grades 2
-
6 who lead schoolwide events and initiate/implement student
-
led changes. Each trimester, awards are 
presented to students for improvement, achievement and effort d
uring Honors and Primary Awards ceremonies. Primary students are 
recognized using criteria specific to their individual strengths and grade levels. Upper grade students are recognized for hi
gh report card 
grades, citizenship, improvement, effort, service a
nd tutoring. Assemblies are student
-
led with student speakers directing the program. 
Red Ribbon Week and the Great Kindness Challenge are two weeks which are also dedicated to teaching students to make good cho
ices. 
 
 
All teachers and the principal are com

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information 
relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019

Oppor
tunities for Parent Involvement
 
Parents and community members are strongly encouraged to become collaborative partners at Shuey School.  Parent involvement a
ctivities reflect a 
wide array of support to the school 
-
 
from volunteerism to PTA to school events
.  Parent volunteers are welcome on campus and provide a vital resource 
to the school.  Whether parents volunteer one day a year, once a month, or weekly, their efforts are greatly needed and appre
ciated.  All parent 
volunteers provide a clearance of tuber
culosis and are fingerprinted through the Department of Justice and the FBI.  The Shuey PTA is another critical 
resource to the school.  Their tireless fundraising efforts provide field trips, classroom supplies and instructional resourc
es.  The PTA also c
oordinates a 
number of family activities, including Family Fun Nights, Pasta Dinner Night, a track meet and movie nights.  These family ac
tivities provide an important 
and positive connection between home and school that goes beyond the academic arena.  He
althy life choices are promoted through PTA events such 
as healthy food fundraisers and no device family activities.  Additionally, these events are often no cost or low cost to fam
ilies, providing a much
-
needed 
community service.  For example, Family Fun 
Nights are $1.50 per student, and parents and children enjoy a family evening of games and device
-
free 
entertainment.  Pictures with Santa is a free event where parents bring their own camera to take pictures with their children
 
and Santa.
 
 
Parents are enc

activities and events through 
PTA newsletters, information packets, Back

Ed telephone 
system.  The Sunday phone message is delivered to parents in English, Spanish, Vi
etnamese, Cantonese and Mandarin.  In addition, the Sunday message 

r incoming kindergarten 
students held in May and August.  Parent
s also assist with Science Olympiad and Math Field Day by helping with organizing students for events and also 
participating in the actual competition day.

Back to School Night and Open House are well
-
attended events.  Each year we try to organize differe
nt activities for parents and their children.  At Open 
House, PTA hosts a dinner which is usually run by the local Boy Scout troop and provides families with a nice low cost family
 
meal.  Also at Open House, 
a "7 Habits Scavenger Hunt," in which parents an
d their children look for various forms of evidence of the 7 Habits, leading to a raffle held the following 
day for students, is a fun and engaging activity for parents to learn about the Leader in Me Program.  During Back to School 
Night, the computer lab
 
is 
open to assist parent with the online registration and download the Rosemead School District app.  Additionally, multi
-
lingual staff is available to parents 
to help them navigate the online registration or to download the app.
 
 
A Welcome Back Fair is h
eld in August the week before school begins.  Teachers and staff work at different stations, including completing the online 
registration, meal application, PTA sign ups, parent policy forms, and emergency cards.  Translators and staff are available 
to ass
ist parents with 
completing online forms and explaining the different policies.  The local Boy Scout troop also sends high school volunteers w
ho assist parents with 
completing online forms.  The district nurse is available to answer questions, and the afte
r school program staff enroll students and accept child care 
payments.  Each parent is given a stamp card with each of the stations listed.  Once the stamp card is filled, the parent and
 
student receive their new 
classroom assignment.  This event has prove
n to be successful, with over 300 parents attending for the past two years, and we hope to continue it in the 
coming years.
 
 
Parent Power Hour is also a well
-
received event to give parents a better idea of what their child is learning at school.  Because o
f the large working parent 

 
their time off from work.  
Parent Power Hour is a one hour period scheduled at the end of January where
 
parents can spend time learning with their child.  Teachers plan various 
activities for this event, ranging from the online programs used at school, to the 7 Habits, to preparing for state mandated 
testing.
 
 
The Franklin Covey corporation and Leader in Me
 
also provide a parent survey which is available online.  The two end of the year surveys give us much 
needed information as we plan our programs for the upcoming year.
 
 
Parents serve on the School Site Council and also on English Language Advisory Council
 
(ELAC).  Both councils give input into the School Plan for School 
Achievement as well as give input into decisions made at the school site.  Shuey parents also participate in the district's D
istrict Advisory Council (DAC) 
and the District English Language
 
Advisory Committee (DELAC) meetings, where they give input into district decisions and policies.
 
 
The district sponsors many activities to provide parents with ways to support their children's academic and social needs. The
 
Rosemead Educational 
Foundation
 
organizes a variety of events, including a Health Fair (also known as the Run/Walk), and a Casino Night fundraiser.
 
 
The school offers meetings for parents of English Learners and Title 1 students to provide an understanding of the ELPAC test
, district/st
ate assessments, 
and ways to support all students.
 
 
Parent involvement has always been an area of concern.  There tends to be low participation at parent meetings, and with the 
exception of a few events 
such as Back to School Night, Open House, Spring Fest
ival and the Book Character parade, parent participation is very low.  In an attempt to address this 
situation, the school has been offering incentives such as free dress coupons or homework passes.  These incentives seem to h
elp increase parent 
attendance

State Priority: School Clima
te
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
School Safety Plan
 
All 
California public schools must develop a comprehensive school safety plan per California Education Code sections 32280
-
32289. The plan provides 
students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment.   The school district provides a
 
compliance checklist to ensure that each 
school plan is comprehensive.  Included in this checklist are assurances that stakeholders, including parents and School Site
 
Council, are involved in the 

s the following requirements: current status of school crime, child abuse reporting procedures, 
disaster procedures, routine, and emergency, policies related to suspension and expulsion, notification to teachers, sexual h
arassment policy, provision 
of a sc
hool
-
wide dress code, safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and school employees, safe and orderly school environment, and s
chool rules and 
procedures.
 
 
Shuey School is a closed campus. During school hours, all gates are secured, and all visitors che
ck in with the front office. All visitors are required to sign 
in and wear a visitor's badge during their stay. While we welcome visits by parents and community members, anyone wishing to 
be on campus during 
school hours must check in first. All volunteers
 
are fingerprinted through the Department of Justice and the FBI and provide a negative TB test or chest 
x
-
ray.  Parents wishing to accompany their children on field trips are also required to go through the fingerprinting and TB cl
earance process.  During
 
lunch, breaks, and before and after school, noon duty supervisors and teachers supervise students and monitor the campus, inc
luding the cafeteria and 
playgrounds, to ensure a safe and orderly environment.  All students wear a school uniform, which consist
s of a white or navy collared shirt with navy or 
khaki pants.  School spirit t
-
shirts are allowed on Fridays.  Students who cannot afford a uniform can participate in the Operation School Bell program, 
which provides free uniforms for students.  This year,
 
PTA organized a uniform recycling program which was held at the Welcome Back Fair at the 
beginning of the school year.  Parents donated gently used and outgrown uniforms, and other parents were able to select from 
a wide variety of 
donations.  Additionall
y, the PTA donates $250 to the school district, which in turn provides uniforms for students who are unable to afford them.

Regularly scheduled fire, lockdown and earthquake drills are conducted, and procedures and revisions are made with each drill
.  The
 
school district 
utilizes the Catapult Emergency Management System, which is an online system to alert all staff and first responders to emerg
ency situations via their 
laptop, phones, ipads or other devices.  All staff have been trained to use the Catapult
 
system.  Drills are held using the Catapult system.  Student and 
staff attendance, location and safety are also accounted for using the Catapult management system.   An online chat room is a
ctivated in the Catapult 

cy team to be in constant contact with each other along with district and Catapult personnel.
 
 
Additionally, staff has been trained to use a "Command Center" board, which provides a common point of documentation and reco
rd keeping during 
drills.  Attendanc
e and any other anomalies are reported to the ""Command Center," which provides a central point for response.  Room numbers a
re 
painted on the blacktop, which provides a distinct area for each class to line up in the event the students are at recess.  A
ll 
classrooms have a room sign, 
which is used to identify classes during evacuations.  Classes are lined up in prescribed order and evacuate with "buddy" cla
sses.  In this way, any missing 
or hurt individual and other emergency situations would be quickly ide
ntified.  An emergency backpack has been distributed to all classrooms.  The 
backpack holds the current attendance roster, evacuation procedures and maps, buddy lists, and lockdown procedures.  Addition
ally, there is an 
emergency flip card, which gives ins
tructions for each different disaster scenario including lockdown, fire, earthquake, etc.  In an evacuation, teachers 
take the backpacks with them, which has all the information they need.  Lockdown buckets which contain food and toilet suppli
es are issued
 
to every 
classroom and room on campus.  Door blocks are used so that doors are kept in the locked position during the school day but t
he door is accessible to 
students and staff. By using the door locks, staff would not have to fumble for keys in the even
t of an emergency; they would merely slide the door lock 
to secure the door.  Each year the school participates in the Great Shakeout Drill for earthquake preparedness.  Mock injurie
s and blocked evacuation 
pathways allow staff emergency teams to practice 
then evaluate the effectiveness of school procedures.  An evaluation form of the Shakeout drill is 
distributed to all staff.  The evaluations forms are reviewed by the principal and emergency teams and revisions to procedure
s are made.
 
 
The school 
evaluates the plan annually and updates it as needed. The plan was last updated in January 2018. The school also works with t
he Alliance of 
Schools for Cooperative Insurance Programs (ASCIP) to review and update the safety plan.  ASCIP has provided teacher
s with professional development 
training on active shooters, first aid, and intruders on campus.  The district M&O staff also reviews our emergency supplies 
and procedures.

Professional development occurs in a variety of formats, including full day and 
half
-
day in
-
services both held on
-
site and off
-
site.  There are 6 professional 
development days allocated by the district.  The majority of these days are scheduled and planned by the district.   This yea
r's focus is writing and math.
 
 
Professional develop
ment is held for staff, both certificated and classified, in Positive Behavior Intervention and Support (PBIS) and Leader in 
Me (LIM)/7 
Habits.  The PBIS staff lead team receives ongoing professional development from the LA County Office of Education.  The
 
Staff Lighthouse coach (LIM) 
and the principal receive ongoing professional development from the Franklin Covey Foundation.  For both PBIS and LIM, inform
ation and expertise 
garnered through professional development is then shared with the rest of the sta
ff during staff meetings.
 
 
This year, a team of 2 teachers (one general education and one special education), a classified staff and the principal recei
ve 4 days of MTSS training.  
Through this training, MTSS will be disseminated to the rest of the 
Shuey staff.  The MTSS focus at Shuey will be to build the "bookcase" or organizational 
device which will house all of the Shuey programs, documents and procedures in an easy to use, one
-
stop binder or online system.
 
 
Additionally, site
-
based Title I funds
 
are allocated to each grade level for professional development.  Each grade level is allocated $1500 from site
-
based 
Title I funds to attend the professional development of their choice.   At the end of each school year, the teachers and prin
cipal decide 
the areas of focus 
for the upcoming year after reviewing test scores and school site data.  Teachers apply for professional development opportun
ities based upon these 
areas of focus with an agreement that they share what they learned at a subsequent staff 
meeting.  For this year, the areas of focus include writing in 
both language arts and math, NGSS, technology and parent involvement.  Teachers are encouraged to find summer or weekend prof
essional development 
opportunities so as not to impact instruction w
ith substitute teachers.  Teachers are also encouraged to attend summer and weekend professional 
development as a group to promote collaboration.  Additional professional development is offered to teachers based on need an
d funds availability.
 
 
During late
 
start Wednesdays, short webinars are also implemented as needed.  The principal also leads professional development during la
te start staff 
meetings in the areas of state mandated testing protocols and test preparation.  This year's focus on writing in bo
th language arts and math has also 
been an area discussed at staff meetings.
