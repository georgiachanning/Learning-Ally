By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Set in a rural valley, the school has 11 classrooms, a
 
STEAM lab, a library, and a multi purpose room with a stage. Outdoor 
facilities include an outdoor eating area, a large blacktop playground, an extensive play structure area, an undeveloped 
field and a play field. The presence of a regular, daily custodia
n and an ongoing maintenance program ensure that the 
school is clean, well maintained, well
-
lit, and in good repair. Modern and up to date lighting, heating, cooling and fire 
suppression systems provide a comfortable and safe learning environment for all s
tudents and staff. Students are taught 
respect, responsibility and safety for themselves and their property, as well as for others and the property of others. This 
leads to a high level of awareness towards eliminating trash or graffiti on the school groun
ds.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The parents/guardians of the school's students along with the community members from the Two Rock Valley are essential 
components of the Two Rock School community. The Two Rock School Educational Fo
undation (TRSEF), the School Site 
Council/Local Control Accountability Plan Committee, and the English Learner Advisory Council all depend on active 
volunteers. We coordinate special events, such as STEAM challenges and Career Days, which provide opportuni
ties for 
parents to share skills and see what students are doing. Other special programs and activities, support in classrooms, the 
physical education and enrichment programs, Schools of Hope tutoring program, the library, and the office are all areas 
wher
e parent volunteers are actively involved.

-

The Safe Schools/School Safety 
Plan is a document that is reviewed annually and revised on a regular basis. The staff 
members and Site Council/LCAP committee members participate in a regular review of the plan, and we recently created 
a School Safety Committee to gather stakeholder inpu
t on safety issues throughout the year.  School Board members are 
kept apprised of the details of the plan, reviewing and approving it each year. The Safe Schools Plan was approved on 
February 14, 2019.

In alignment with the adoption of Common Core aligned curriculum in math, English Language Arts and English Language 
Development,  professional development focused on content integration, student engagement strategies, incorporating 
technology and 21st century skills, and student intervention systems.  Teachers have also work to develop standards
-
aligned assessments and 
report cards, with substantial professional development time spent on collaboration and the 
development of a professional learning community.  This year we are also including professional development in the Next 
Generation Science Standards, Science, Techn
ology, Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM) strategies.  Professional 
development is delivered through weekly after school meetings, conference attendance, and mentoring and coaching 
relationships with staff from the Sonoma County Office of Education.  With 
the addition of grant funding, teachers received 
training in Social Emotional Learning and Toolbox curriculum, and STEAM curriculum that supports the integration of 
science, technology, engineering, and math, as well as the arts.
