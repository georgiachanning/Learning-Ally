About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availa
bility of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Miller Creek Elementary School District held a Public Hearing on October 9, 2019, and determined that each school within the 
district had sufficient and 
good quality textbooks, instructi
onal materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. Textbooks 
and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making the 
textbooks us
ed in the 
school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation 
is made to the School 
Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials a
re available for parent examination at the district 
office prior to adoption. The table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other 
instructional materials used at the school.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the St

Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education populati
on and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that 
satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical
