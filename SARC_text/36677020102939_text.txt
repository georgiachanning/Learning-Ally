By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Etiwanda Colony Elementary provides a safe and clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance 
and campus supervision. Original school buildings were constructed in 2004. Ongoing
 
maintenance ensures school 
facilities are kept safe, in good working condition, and continue to provide adequate space for students and staff.

Etiwanda Colony Elementary is proud of its high standards regarding campus maintenance and general housekeeping
 
practices. Staff and students enjoy the benefits of having a well
-
maintained and beautiful campus.
 
 
School staff and the maintenance department work together to ensure playgrounds, classrooms, and campus grounds are 
well
-
maintained. Maintenance and Operat
ions (M&O) oversees a work order process enabling school staff to 
communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Teachers, support staff, and the 
principal collaborate efforts to prepare and submit work orders to M&O for re
solution. Emergency situations are given 
high priority and resolved immediately by site or district custodial staff. The principal, school secretary, and day custodia
n 
communicate each morning on an informal basis to discuss schedules, campus maintenance, 
and safety concerns. The 
director of maintenance and operations (M&O) meets with the principal once a month to discuss maintenance
-
related 
issues associated with campus upkeep, safety, classroom space, equipment, upcoming events, work orders (submitted 
and
 
outstanding), and special requests. The director of M&O checks in with the school custodian to see if there are items 
needed or concerns that need to be addressed.
 
 
Schools are required by state law to conduct a formal inspection annually of designated ar
eas and systems and then 
prepare a report of the current condition of facilities.  The School Site Inspection table illustrated in this report identif
ies 
the state
-
required inspection areas and discloses the operational status in each of those areas.

maintenance, and minor repairs. M&O provides formal training twice a year on the proper use of equipment, cleaning 
procedures, and chemical usage.
 
One full
-
time day custodian is responsible for keeping the campus clean and fully 

cleaning the cafeteria after meals are served. Every m
orning before school begins, the day custodian inspects school 
facilities for safety hazards and maintenance issues that require attention before staff and students arrive on campus. 
Restrooms are checked throughout the day as a proactive measure in keepin
g facilities stocked, sanitary, and safe. Any 
graffiti or signs of vandalism are removed immediately.
 
 
A professional janitorial service is responsible for thoroughly cleaning classrooms and restrooms during the evenings. The 
district office dispatches a t

irrigation systems.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic
al education sequences or programs 
of study.
