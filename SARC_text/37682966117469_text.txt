By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Creekside Elementary School is part of the award winning Poway Unified School District. Creekside has the distinction of 
being the 21st elementary school in the district and the first school to open in the 21st century. Creekside was named a 
Cal
ifornia Distinguished School in 2014, a National Blue Ribbon School in 2016, and a National PTA School of Excellence in 
2019.  Creekside was built with a vision for the future and preparing our students to be productive citizens and experience 
successful c
areers. The physical structure of Creekside is unique. It consists of 30 permanent classrooms organized into 
five villages in addition to one temporary classroom. Each of the villages contains six classrooms, student restrooms, a 
staff restroom, as well as
 
a workroom and a large village "square" or common area. The common area is used for 
individualized instruction, groups to collaborate, space for technology, and parent volunteers to work. The main building 
houses the administrative office, a full size mul
ti
-
purpose room, library, and the RSP special education program. The 
before/after school care and the preschool are also located in the center of the campus adjacent to the cafeteria and 
lunch area.
 
 
The staff of Creekside represents a group of outstanding
 
individuals who are well educated and trained to maximize equity 
and access for each child. Staff, parents, and students come together to create a positive learning environment that 
provides numerous opportunities for all children to experience rigor, rel
evancy, and relationship building. With the 
support of our PTA and Creekside Educational Foundation, we are able to provide our students with enrichment 
opportunities in technology, math, art, and music. The support of parents and the numerous volunteers o
n campus each 
day contribute to the success of our students.
 
 
Mission Statement: Creekside Elementary School is a community of lifelong learners committed to high academic 
achievement and respect for all in an environment that fosters responsibility, colla
boration, communication, and 
celebrations.  Vision:  Every student.  Every day.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Poway 
Unified School District ensures that students attend clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each of its 
schools is maintained in good repair.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained
.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and well maintained.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A night custodial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms and offices daily.  
The district has adopted cleaning standards for all sch
ools.  A summary of these standards is available at the district offices.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Creekside 
recognizes the importance of the partnership between home and school and remains committed to providing 
a learning community and valuing all stakeholders. Parents have been included in the improvement process and serve in 
an advisory capacity on committees
. In addition to classroom support, parent volunteers work in a variety of areas: the 
volunteer workroom, Arts Attack program, triannual Read
-
In Nights, family reading time, book fairs, carnival, haunted 
house, spelling bee, Biz Town, Junior Achievement, W
e the People Jeopardy, science fair, Dinner and Auction, Fun Run, 
field trips, and mentor reading programs.
 
 
The PTA maintains a volunteer database and posts/emails volunteer opportunities to parents who indicated that they 
want to volunteer. Parents are a
lso welcome to contact the office and teachers directly to inquire about volunteering. Our 
parent involvement is a signature practice that earned Creekside the California Distinguished Schools, National Blue 
Ribbon, and National PTA School of Excellence aw
ards.  We hold a new family orientation meeting a few days before 
school to introduce parents to the PTA and CEF presidents and explain how they can be involved at school.  Our CEF and 
PTA board members wear shirts that identify them as board members at sc
hool events to make it easy for new families 
to meet our parent leaders.  Our PTA also holds a Room Parent training each fall to help parents feel comfortable about 
volunteering and to set up a support network for their success.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Creekside places a strong emphasis on safety for students and staff. Our comprehensive safety 
plan is reviewed in March, 
August, and October each year and staff are kept up
-
to
-
date on new protocol. Over the years we have worked with our 
School Resource Officer, City of San Diego traffic department, and the District transportation department to refi
ne our 
parking lot rules and to review safe driving practices on adjacent roads. We plan a week long "Spotlight on Parking Lot" 
each year to really focus on all the safety rules and to involve students through our Prepare for Departure message to 
reduce ti
me at the curb.  Our comprehensive safety plan includes the addition of wait lines along our curbs to keep 
students far enough back for maximum safety.  Our site safety plan also includes supports for students who are new to 
Creekside:  buddies, game time 
to meet new friends, orientation in August, and Sanford Harmony, a campus social 
emotional learning campaign to promote empathy and inclusion in the classroom, and at lunch tables and playground 
games.

Our school continues to lock all doors and gates duri
ng the school day. Visitors and families are required to enter through 
the front office where they log into a computer visitor system, which prints a name tag, logs their time and also documents 
volunteer hours. School staff wear ID badges every day.  Our 
custodians monitor the back gate off the field before and 
after school during peak arrival and departure times.
 
 
Annual training procedures and drills for earthquakes, fire, and bus evacuation are held.  this year we have added new 
Options Based Response t
raining for intruders.  Maintenance staff work with a scheduled preventive program to offset 
costly repairs whenever possible. Extended Student Services is available to students for before and after
-
school childcare.

Research supports the positive effects of professional development on increasing student 
learning. The teaching staff is 
afforded the opportunity to participate in District professional development. These TLC workshops are presented in a 
semester or year
-
long series and support a wide variety of professional development. These include the use 
of effective 
instructional strategies, implementing the use of computer technology in teaching and learning, critical thinking, writing 
and mathematics strategies, effective use of assessments, positive discipline in
-
services, and multicultural training.
 
 
The current focus of professional learning time is on the California State Standards. The school site provides 1
-
2 hours per 
month of additional site
-
directed professional development that is designed to encourage collaboration while delving 
deeper into th
e concepts of the district professional development.  The great majority of professional development 
through the year is delivered on campus, but teams do attend conferences when topics match a site need.
 
 
The district 
also provides an X
-
Ploration program 
with teacher
-
led STEAM and PE activities for students, which releases classroom 
teachers to collaborate by grade level 17 times per year for 1.5 hours each time.
 
 
Teachers and administrators are actively involved in professional development activities at t
he school, district, state, and 
national level. The Poway Professional Assistance Program (PPAP) provides support for new teachers. Teachers are 
encouraged to participate in the National Board Certification process and recognized by the Poway Unified Schoo
l District 
when they earn NBCT status.  Our site also has two Professional Learning Leaders (PLL) supported by the District.  One PLL 
focuses on Response to Intervention;  the other PLL has a focus on the California Next Generation Science Standards and 
su
pporting teachers in full implementation of the science Standards.
 
 
Additionally, the district continually expands the use of digital resources, which offers flexibility in the types of profess
ional 
development and allow teachers to self
-
direct their ongoi
ng professional learning.
