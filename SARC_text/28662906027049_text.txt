By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019

Principal's Message
 
St. Helena Elementary School serves 249 students in third, fourth and fifth grade with research
-
based core academic 
programs that promote mastery of the Common Core State Standar
ds. At St. Helena Elementary School, students find 
abundant opportunities to apply past learning, extend their skills and widen their horizons. Our school is an innovative 
and kid
-
focused learning community. We strongly believe in and support the potential
 
of each student.
 
 
To enhance the sense of interconnectedness within our school community, we start each morning with a school
-
wide 
assembly where we review important messages, celebrate accomplishments and sing a song with a positive social 
message.
 
 
Our instructional schedule includes large blocks of core curricular instruction with curriculum including Benchmark 
Advanced based English language arts (ELA) and English language development (ELD), Lucy Calkins Writers Workshop, Go 
Math! and FOS
S science. Our instructional program is enhanced by our 1:1 Chromebook project. This project allows us to 
more effectively differentiate student instruction, publish for real
-
world audiences, extend learning beyond the school 
day, build technology expertis
e and continue to increase student motivation.
 
 
As a complement to our strong core academic programs, we offer an array of enrichment opportunities for students. We 
believe that the arts and physical
-
fitness education are fundamental to the development of 
well
-
rounded citizens, so all 
students participate weekly special classes focused upon BSTEAM (bilingual science, technology, engineering, art and 
math) projects, music, physical education and Spanish. In addition, an extensive after
-
school enrichment prog
ram is 

-
on learning activities also add meaning 
and relevance to our academic programs.
 
 
Vision and Mission Statements:
 
Our vision is to provide and engaging and 
dynamic learning environment that inspires a passion for learning and prepares 
every student to adapt and thrive as a responsible citizen in a rapidly changing world.
 
 
SHES provides academic rigor within a safe and supportive learning environment where stu
dents can explore their 
creativity, collaboratively problem solve, and fully develop as resilient, caring and responsible individuals, learners, and 
citizens.

style St. Helena Elementary School main building was constructed in 1932 with classrooms, an office 
area and an auditorium with seating and a stage. Additional classrooms were added in the 1950s and 1970s. In 2007, a 
Boys & Girls Club building of
 
1,100 square feet was constructed on the elementary school grounds. The building serves as 
day use for the school (PE, art, guest presentations, etc.) as well as an after

school Boys & Girls Club for student 
members.The latest modernization project, funde
d by passage of a local facilities improvement bond, provided enhanced 
wiring to support our technological infrastructure, a new emergency alert system, new windows and replacement of some 
doors and all safety locks and handles. The school sits on 7.3 acre
s in the heart of downtown St. Helena.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade elev
en. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabil
ities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

enrichment programs, serving on school committees such as the Parent Teacher Group and the English Language Advisory 
Committee, and serving o
n district subcommittees such as the Academic Excellence, Local Control and Accountability and 
Wellness Committees. Community groups such as Napa Valley Vintners and St. Helena Public Schools Foundation enrich

At the first meeting of each year, the staff discusses the school safety plan. In addition, this is an annual topic at the Sc

2000. Monthly emergency evacuation drills 
are held at random times during the school day, and proper evacuation procedures are followed. Key elements to the plan 
include two

This year, the staff had one day prior to the start of the school year for professional development. Professional 
development is also done throughout the year on eight minimum days, using release time for teachers, and in the summer.
 
 
The district is commi
tted to providing the highest quality professional development for all teachers. Principals encourage 
teachers to seek advanced degrees, credentials and other certifications. The district participates and supports new 
teachers through the Beginning Teacher
 
Support and Assessment (BTSA) program.
 
 
Certificated representatives from all district schools meet periodically throughout the school year to discuss, among other 
things, district professional development initiatives. Current areas of focus are different
iated instruction, instructional 
strategies to support English language learners, Common Core Math strategies, Depth of Knowledge (DOK) and Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS). A districtwide commitment supports teacher implementation via conferences, i
n
-
service training and coaching.
