on WICOR strategies: Writing to Learn, Inquiry, Collaboration, Organization, and Reading to Learn 
so that students are prepared for success in their elementary, middle and high school ye

hope is that students will be able to see college as a viable option for their future.  We are excited

Students attend the STEAM Enrichment Lab where they engage in hands
-
on activities centered on 
the Next Generation Science Standards.  Students have the opportunity to use their critical thinking 
and problem
-
solving skills as 
they work through STEAM concepts using the engineering design 
process.  All students also attend the Technology/Media Lab, where they not only learn about 
computer basics (keyboarding and word processing), they also learn about digital citizenship and 
cybe
rsafety as well as learn the art of coding and computer science.  Students also create multi
-
media presentations as a synthesis of their learning.  In addition, we are proud to offer all students 
1:1 access to Google Chromebooks.  The 1:1 mobile device pro
gram allows our students to engage 

critical thinking skills and creativity as they participate in project
-
based learning units.  Technology 
is an instructi
onal tool that allows teachers to make learning meaningful, engaging and innovative!  
The Willow staff continues to strive to use technology in ways that allow for more effective 
communication with our parents, families, and community.
 
 
Willow prides itsel
f on being a safe, positive and welcoming school.  We continue to implement our 
school
-
wide PBIS framework (Positive Behaviors Interventions and Supports) to ensure that all 
students learn and do well academically, behaviorally, and social
-

order to achieve 
this goal, we have established school

has monthly Spirit Days to celebrate the fun in school.  Students have morning fitness daily and also 
participate in Flash Mob Fridays where the entire school dances at the weekly Willow WISE Spirit 
Assemb

provide several Parent University workshops for parents and host Family Nights each trimester. 
Willow also has an active PTA that helps with fundraising.  We

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible s
tudents 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of
