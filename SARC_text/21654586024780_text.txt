School Description
 
 
Our Vision
 
Glenwood Elementary School is a place where you will find dedicated educators, committed 
families, and engaged students working collaboratively to create a positive and rigorous 21st 
century 
learning environment. Students and teachers have mutual respect and high expectations 
for one another in order to foster college and career readiness skills.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
The purpose of the Glenwood School Community is to provide each student with a 
challenging 
educational program which develops and nurtures self
-
esteem, intellectual curiosity, independent  
thinking, and in the process, creates a happy and productive citizen.
 
 
Description
 
Glenwood Elementary School (a public K 

 
5 school) is perfectly situated in a clean, friendly 
neighborhood on the San Francisco Bay. There are lush, beautiful hillsides, a saltwater marsh, and 
the Bay in walking proximity. We work closely with neighborhood
 
residents to maintain the rich 
natural environment that the Glenwood area provides for our students and families. The school 
serves a community composed primarily of single
-
family homes in east San Rafael, and also luckily 
includes intra
-
district transfer
 
students from other areas of San Rafael.
 
 
At Glenwood, we listen and respond carefully to the wishes of our community to achieve a program 
of educational excellence. Our academic core subjects program is thematically integrated and 
differentiated to meet 
the needs of all of our learners. There is an emphasis on basic skills 
instruction that stresses grade level mastery in math and language arts. We believe that all persons 
on our campus are learners and thus have created a culture of constant professional 
development 
and collegial collaboration for staff in order to create and lead rigorous, differentiated instruction 
for all students.
 
 
During the 2019
-
2020 school year, Glenwood Elementary School will serve 385 students. Student 
enrollment ethnicity is 67% 
White, 21% Hispanic or Latino, 3% Asian, and 9% other groups.  11% of 
our students are English Learners. Our Special Education Program provides Individualized Education 
Plans for 9% of our population. 19% of our students are Socioeconomically Disadvantaged
.
 
 
Glenwood has more than two hundred parent and community volunteers that support the work 
and vision of the school in everything from classroom volunteers and field trip drivers to community 
building activities.
 
 
There are currently twenty classrooms, a technology lab, an art s
tudio, science lab, and 2 multi
-
purpose rooms on campus. In order to support our working parents, there is an efficient on
-
site 
daycare center for school
-
age children and interest based classes run by the City of San Rafael.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condit
ion and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annua
l school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the 
California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

on instructional materials.
 
 
The California 
Department of Education has determined textbook selection and adoption schedules. The district follows the state schedule for
 
these 
adoptions and has purchased textbooks from the most recent state
-
approved lists. All approved instructional materials are al
igned with California content 
standards for core academic areas.
 
 
The Elementary School District Curriculum Advisory Council reviews curriculum recommendations and revisions materials utilize
d in the support of the 
instructional program. The Curriculum Cou
ncil recommendations are forwarded to the Board of Education for final approval. This is an ongoing process, 
assuring that all textbooks and instructional materials are systematically reviewed, updated, and supplemented.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
At Glenwood School, the campus is orderly and students feel safe at school. The school ensures that on
-
site supervision is provided for programs that 
take place during and after school. Teachers, day care personnel, 
and people who run the after
-
school programs supervise students both before and 
after school. A city run day care facility is on campus after school on a fee basis.
 
 
District and school policy require that during the school day all guests to the campus che

them for security personnel and all staff and students.
 
 
Glenwood Elementary School was originally built in 1964 and with voter
-
approved school bond funds and state modernization funds, has
 
been 
modernized in phases from 2002 to 2004. Improvements to Glenwood included modernization of existing classrooms and the multip
urpose building, an 
addition of a new classroom wing to replace portable classrooms, expansion of the library/computer lab an
d student services area, and an addition of a 
new science classroom/lab. The school has a total of 20 classrooms 
-
 
19 permanent and one portable classroom with new exterior paint and carpeting 
that was installed during the summer of 2007 to accommodate an 
increase in student enrollment. Thanks to the good work of the PTA and other school 
supporters, a new sunshade was installed over the courtyard area in 2006
-
2007.
 
 
The district strives to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. All bathroo
ms, classrooms, and offices are cleaned daily. Students are 
encouraged to help keep the campus clean by recycling. District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep 
the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely m
anner. An online maintenance order request process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority.

San Rafael voters approved Measure A in November 2015 to fund capital facilities projects to improve our school facilities. M
easure A provides $108 

le school facilities.
 
 
SRCS' bond program is providing much needed capital improvements to our facilities to create safe, innovative learning enviro
nments and to provide 
instructional technology to support 21st century learning. Additional classrooms, labs
 
and equipment are being built and improved to reduce 
overcrowding in our schools and to better meet the growing demand for hands
-
on science, technology, engineering, arts and math (STEAM) classes. Site 

pital Facilities Team, have contributed greatly to shape the plans for these improvements, and the 
construction work is ongoing throughout the district.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Parent involvement is a vital component of the educational program at Glenwood Elementary School. San Rafael City Schools wou
ld not be what it is 
today without the contributions of countless parents and guardians who 
give their time and expertise as volunteers and who share their financial 
resources to support the goals and aspirations of San Rafael City Schools.
 
 

ough a number of activities. Opportunities for 
active parent involvement include participation on the School Site Council (SSC), Glenwood's English Language Advisory Counci
l (ELAC), district and site 
subcommittees that address specific program needs, and t
he Glenwood School Foundation (GSF). The Glenwood School Foundation raises funds and 
sponsors activities, special events, and vital programs that support the school.
 
 
Glenwood has a robust parent volunteer program. The administration, GSF, and teaching sta
ff work with parents to help train, schedule, and coordinate 
their participation in classroom and school activities. The parent volunteer program serves a comprehensive model of support 
and includes parents, 
senior citizens, community members, and local bu
sinesses.
 
 
Parents are also made to feel welcome through various informational and community
-
building events, including back
-
to
-
school nights, a parent speaker 
series, concerts, and other artistic and academic performances.

School Safety Plan
 
Date reviewed and Updated:November 30, 2019
 
Date discussed with school faculty: 10/30/2019
 
 
Glenwood Elementary School has a comprehensive school safety plan covering all aspects of planning for emergency response and
 
student safety. This 
plan is based on 
and coordinated with the district and county emergency preparedness plans. The plan is reviewed with school staff at the star
t of the 
school year. The plan is updated annually to increase preparedness for any emergency, including storms, fire, earthquake, 
or intruders on campus. The 
school has staff members who are trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and first aid. Disaster drills are held once 
a semester throughout the 
year. Fire drills are held once a month and lock down drills are held twice a
 
year. The school also participates in an annual county
-
wide disaster 
preparedness drill. There are disaster supplies both in the classroom and in a storage area in the Multi
-
Purpose Room.
 
 
Key elements included in the school safety plan include: disaster 
procedures, parent and staff phone trees, bus driver disaster procedures, county 
emergency phone numbers, procedures for safe ingress and egress of pupils, and staff emergency teams broken down by specific 
jobs for each teacher 
in the case of an emergency.
 
We also have a student safety and wellness committee made up of parents and teachers. They created plans of action for 
any issues of student safety that could arise throughout the year. We have a unified approach for the management of allergies
 
on Glenwoo

that provides all children with a safe and consistent learning environment.
