By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The school was built in May 1966 on 13.6 acres of land. The school includes 7 permanent buildings. The school facilities 
and grounds are clean and
 
monitored by our districts grounds crew, maintenance department and the school custodians. 
Restrooms are monitored regularly by custodial staff and cleaned daily. The school's enrollment ranges from 440
-
450 
during the school year. Prospect Elementary's mo
dernization project was completed in August of 2007. Each classroom 
was upgraded with technology which included LCD projectors, ELMO document cameras and computers. Classrooms also 
include built in cabinetry such as teaching walls, teacher desks, student c
omputer stations and book cases. The roof, air 
conditioning and heating as well as flooring was replaced during the project. During the summer of 2011 our parking lot 
and lunch shelter, both main one and kindergarten,  were modernized by using leftover mod
ernization funds from the 
original modernization project.  With the expansion of the parking lot, the softball field was relocated to the north field 
and reconstructed over on that side to be used by school district as well as the community. Work orders ha
ve been 
created/addressed for all items noted as fair/poor with our custodial staff and/or district maintenance department.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Prospect depends on 
parents to be involved in the education of their children through volunteering in classrooms and 
participating in the School Site Council, English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), and the Parent School Association. 
The PSA contributions go directly to i
