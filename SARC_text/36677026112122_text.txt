By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Terra Vista Elementary provides a safe and clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance and 
campus supervision. Original school buildings were constructed in 1994. Ongoing maintenance ensures school facilities 
are kept safe, in good
 
working condition, and continue to provide adequate space for students and staff.
 
 
Terra Vista Elementary is proud of its high standards regarding campus maintenance and general housekeeping practices. 
Staff and students enjoy the benefits of having a wel
l
-
maintained and beautiful campus.
 
 
School staff and the maintenance department work together to ensure playgrounds, classrooms, and campus grounds are 
well
-
maintained. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) oversees a work order process enabling school staff to
 
communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. The custodian and school secretary 
coordinate efforts to prepare and submit a work order to M&O for resolution. Emergency situations are given high priority 
and resolved immed
iately by site or district custodial staff.

The principal and day custodian communicate on an as
-
needed basis to discuss campus maintenance and safety concerns. 
The director of maintenance and operations (M&O) meets with the principal once a month to disc
uss maintenance

related 
issues associated with campus upkeep, safety, classroom space, equipment, upcoming events, work orders (submitted 
and outstanding), and special requests. The director of M&O then meets with the custodian to conduct a comprehensive 
i
nspection of the school site, and a summary of the inspection findings is forwarded to the principal.
 
 
Schools are required by state law to conduct a formal inspection annually of designated areas and systems and then 
prepare a report of the current condit
ion of facilities. The School Site Inspection table illustrated in this report identifies 
the state
-
required inspection areas and discloses the operational status in each of those areas.
 
 

to handle routine cleaning needs, general maintenance, 
and minor repairs. M&O provides formal training twice a year on the proper use of equipment, cleaning procedures, and 
chemical usage. One full
-
time day custodian is responsible for keeping the campus c
lean and fully operational. The 

meals are served. Every morning before school begins, the day custodian inspects school facilities fo
r safety hazards and 
maintenance issues that require attention before staff and students arrive on campus. Any graffiti or signs of vandalism 
are removed immediately. The custodian checks restrooms frequently throughout the day to ensure facilities remain 
safe, 
stocked, and sanitary.
 
 
A professional janitorial service is responsible for thoroughly cleaning classrooms and restrooms during the evenings. The 

scaping and 
irrigation systems.
 
 
Etiwanda School District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program which provides dollar

components. These 
repairs typically include roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior/exterior painting, and

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
