School Description
 

 
Roosevelt is a community of learners who share a commitment to ensuring that every child who 
comes 
into our school receives a fair and equitable education within a nurturing and safe 
environment.  Our staff and parent groups continually work to make Roosevelt a safe, respectful 
and responsible place to for all children to learn and grow.
 
 
We teach Commo
n Core Standards which require our students to learn concepts deeply and be 
able to explain their thinking.  Our classroom instruction is rich and engaging with a strong focus 
on Global Competency Skills: Collaboration, Critical Thinking, Creativity, and C
ommunication.  By 
ensuring that our students are proficient in the 4 C's, we move closer to closing the achievement 
gap and helping all students reach their full potential.  We continue to engage in courageous 
conversations about race and its impact on stu
dents. Closing the achievement gap will take time, 
energy, and a commitment by all as we continually refine our instructional practice and realign 
resources to support success.
 
 
Our classrooms are equipped with Promethean Boards, Chrome Books at a 1:1 rati
o (grades 1st 
-
 
5th) and 2:1 ratio (TK/K).  Our blended learning model will help ensure that our children are college 
and career ready when they leave SLUSD.  At Roosevelt, every child has a face and a name. At 
Roosevelt, every child has the potential to a
chieve, to learn, and to excel.
 
 
District Mission Statement
 
The mission of the San Leandro Unified School District is to educate students to achieve academic 
excellence in order to become confident, collaborative, and engaged citizens in a 
community rich

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The safety of students and staff is a primary concern at Roosevelt Elementary School. The school is in compliance with all la
ws, rules, and regulations

of the School Site Safety
 
Plan encompasses student safety and evacuation procedures, if necessary. Fire, earthquake and lockdown drills are conducted o
n a monthly basis 
throughout the school year, and intruder drills are conducted twice a year.
 
 
To ensure student safety, 
staff members supervise students at all times before and after school, and during recess and lunch. Any visitors to the campu

Staff development is focused on becoming a Professional Learning Community and 
building capacity around the use of technology in the classroom as 
well as helping teacher implement our new Math and English Language Arts Curriculum, as well as, Project Based Learning.  Our
 
teachers meet every 
Wednesday in  PLCs to discuss curriculum an
d student work.  The Instructional Leadership Team (ILT) meets once per month to assess the professional 
development needs of the school and plan future staff meeting agenda items. We continue to include equity as an ongoing staff
 
development focus area.
 
 
Staff development is supported for classroom implementation through BTSA (Beginning Teachers Support and Assessment) Support 
Providers and District 
Instructional Coaches.  Teachers participate in District Professional Development days 2 times per year wher
e they can choose training courses to meet 
their individual development needs.  Teachers also participate in professional development after
-
school at the district and site level.
 
 
Teachers are also released for full day collaboration with their grade level
 
twice a year.  These planning days allow teachers to continually improve their 
craft and calibrate their teaching techniques with their colleagues.
