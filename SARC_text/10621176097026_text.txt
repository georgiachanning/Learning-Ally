outstanding staff, students and parents. Miramonte Elementary School has received the National 
Blue Ribbon Schools award, has been recognized as a California Distinguished S

strengths of their peers. We believe we are a dynamic school that values the diversity of our 
students by creating a positive, nurturing environment for all kids to learn and succeed!

About the SARC
 
By Febr
uary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fund
ing Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state 
and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

site. The students and 
staff are accountable for maintenance of a clean, safe and orderly 
campus. As a result, the Miramonte campus promotes enjoyment, safety and learning. Our custodial staff consists of a daytime 
plant manager and two 
evening custodians. The custodians perform
 
basic cleaning operations daily and maintain the grounds and buildings. In addition, we conduct deep 
cleaning twice a year. Our SART committee conducts eight clean
-
campus inspections each year.
 
 
This committee of parents inspects the campus grounds and re

School improvement and modernization funds have allowed for vast upgrades and improvements to the school. The interior and ex
terior of the school 
has been modified and provides a more aesthetically p
leasing and functionally sound learning environment. All of these features have helped to promote 
pride in Miramonte as a community center. As a community center, the facilities are used nightly and on weekends for communit
y sports and activities.
 
 
Philoso
phically, the district believes schools are the hub of their neighborhoods. As a result, a high priority is placed on buildin
g and maintaining excellent 
facilities. The latest bond measure passed in June 2012, which provided funding for major renovations a
t Miramonte to improve technology access; 
expand the main office, library, kindergarten wing; and upgrade the entire campus to be more energy efficient. The projects w
ere completed at the end 
of 2013.
 
 
Scheduled maintenance projects include the repainting 
of the stripes and markings in the parking lot and entryways. The school has had extensive 
upgrades over the last 10 years, and no current upgrades are scheduled beyond regular maintenance.

Safety Plan
 
Miramonte has a school safety plan and a School Crisis Intervention Plan on file, and both are available to parents as well a
s the general public. Faculty 
reviews and updates the school plans annually. The staff develops both plans with input f
rom parents and community members who work to ensure a 
safe and nonviolent environment. Specific areas of focus coupled with appropriate strategies to address concerns feature in o
ur school plan. The yearly 
SART survey rates school safety as a positive ele
ment of school life. Key elements of the plan include monthly safety drills and crisis
-
intervention plans.
 
 
The school safety plan was last reviewed, updated and discussed with the school faculty in October 2019 and with the SART in 
November 2019.
 
 
We prid
e ourselves in our sky
-
high standards and our commitment to nonviolence. We use Time to Teach in conjunction to Positive Behavioral 
Interventions and Supports (PBIS) as our school
-
wide behavior system that reinforces positive behavior and rewards students 
for making appropriate 
choices.

Miramonte teachers and staff members are committed to continued professional growth and are involved in the selection of staf
f
-
development activities. 
These 
activities are based on individual and staff needs. Institute week in August was used to do follow
-
up trainings around the Key Learning Principles, 
reading
-
comprehension strategies, and the new
 
reading series, Benchmark Literacy. The staff learned about so
me of the strategies from the Positive 
Behavioral Interventions and Sup ports (PBIS) program and incorporated them in our schoolwide discipline system. Miramonte St
aff will also participate 
in training with AVID, as well as Trauma Informed Schools to suppo
rt students in ALL areas of need.
 
 
As an ongoing professional development, after three years of building Internal Coherence, the teachers will participate in In
structional Rounds with a 
focus on reading comprehension. This process allows teachers to conduc
t peer observations, discuss their findings and make recommendations for 

sessment Department, 
technology trainings and state confer
ences each year.
 
 
The district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mast
ery learning, multi
-
tiered system 
of supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standa
rds, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018
-
19 school year, 
the district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional develop
ment opportunities on staff 
development days, substitute rele
ase days, and on early release days. A variety of after
-
school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.
 
One hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty
-
five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coachi
ng 
through the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site
-
based training and district sponsored training that included:  
curriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi
-
tiered systems o
f support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.

Types of Services Funded
 

 
On an annual basis, Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) submits the Application for Funding Consolidated Application and Re
porting System for 
Categorical Aid Programs commonly called CARS. The application is submitted in two (2) parts:  Part I, which con
tains program and demographic 
information, is submitted by June 1 each year; and Part II, which contains the budget information and additional program data
, is submitted by January 
31 each year.  The categorical programs included in the application are Tit
le I, Part A 

 
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged 
Improving, Title I, Part C 

 
Migrant Education, Title II, Part A 

 
Preparing, Training and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals, and Title III 

 
Language Instruction for Limi
ted English Proficient and Immigrant Students.  Essentially, these funds are designed to assist students in mastering state 
standards.
 
 
Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community
.  CUSD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive differences in the lives of the children we all support.  We know from research tha

education will not only bring success to your child but other children 
in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending
 
on the type of categorical 
funding a site may re
ceive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and guidelines.  Such adviso
ry 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee 
(DAC) and School Advisory Committee (SAC)

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each and every s
tudent.  Parental involvement is a necessary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall program.  At the district level, parent committees provide input into each of the 

Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP)

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://
www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
t
s, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.
 
 
District Advisory Committ
ee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves as an advisory committee
 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. 
They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs are supplemental education opportunit
ies that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  Th
e SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are 
required to form an ELAC. The ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding ser
vices for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two 
years.

District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall 
be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a
 
DELAC representative and arrange to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/gu
ardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student
) currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) elected to serve as the DELAC 

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee me
ets four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achievement of our students, comm
unity agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alask
an Native students in grades K

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP
 
annually that works to better align the academic plan with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to 
participate in the 
development of the LCAP through partici
pation of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, District Meetings and 
Community Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share 
their ideas on how CUSD 
can provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in the forums 


 
 
These forums are designed to provide an opportun

provide input and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to sha
re new ideas to support 
identi
fied groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical funding and programs in CUSD.  These funds are further discussed and outlined
 

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 
G

stics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from econom
ically disadvantaged homes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they have a primary language other than English.  Ch
ildren, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not general
ly provided through the base/core curriculum program.  The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Catego
rical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support
 
to meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of high quality
 
learning opportunities and access to the core curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additional assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom pro
gram (base/core curriculum) 
and address any learning ga
ps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff development.   Staff developme
nt 
activities are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other staff to 
cha
llenge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
