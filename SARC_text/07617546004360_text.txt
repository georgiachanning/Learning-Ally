to
 
promote
 
academic
 
achievement;
 
enhance
 
our
 
students'
 
physical

emotional
 
well-
being
 
by
 
developing
 
a
 
sense
 
of
 
responsibility
 
and
 
respect
 
for
 
one's

a

day
 
will
 
be
 
filled
 
with
 
challenge
 
and
 
fun.

reading
 
level
 
as

strategies
 
via

Workshop;
 
and
 
collaborative
 
teams
 
of

a
 
dream
 
bedroom
 
for
 
a

School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
The
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
is
 
updated
 
at
 
least
 
annually
 
by
 
the
 
School
 
Safety
 
Committee
 
and
 
the
 
School
 
Site
 
Council.
 
The
 
committee
 
is
 
comprised
 
of
 
teachers,
 
staff,
 
parents.
 
The
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
was
 
last
 
adopted
 
on
 
01/09/2020
 
following
 
a
 
series
 
of
 
meetings
 
in
 
which
 
attendance
 
data,
 
discipline
 
data,
 
safety
 
concerns,
 
and
 
other
 
pertinent
 
student
 
data
 
were
 
reviewed.
 
The
 
Emergency
 
Plan
 
was
 
updated,
 
the
 
previous
 
goals
 
of
 
the
 
Safety
 
Committee
 
were
 
analyzed
 
for
 
levels
 
of
 
achievement,
 
and
 
new
 
goals
 
were
 
developed.
 
The
 
plan
 
was
 
taken
 
to
 
the
 
School
 
Site
 
Council
 
for
 
their
 
input
 
and
 
ultimately
 
sent
 
to
 
the
 
MDUSD
 
Board
 
of
 
Directors
 
for
 
approval.
 
The
 
plan
 
was
 
brought
 
to
 
staff
 
for
 
review
 
during
 
the
 
same
 
time,
 
and
 
the
 
goals
 
of
 
the
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
were
 
presented
 
at
 
a
 
PFC
 
meeting,
 
at
 
SSC,
 
and
 
at
 
a
 
staff
 
meeting.
 
The
 
plans
 
were
 
also
 
discussed
 
within
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
monthly
 
principal
 
messages
 
written
 
to
 
parents.
 
 
Current
 
goals
 
include:
 
1.
 
Students
 
will
 
feel
 
safe,
 
comfortable,
 
and
 
supported
 
at
 
Walnut
 
Acres.
 
 
2.
 
Create
 
and
 
maintain
 
environment
 
in
 
which
 
parents
 
and
 
other
 
visitors
 
feel
 
welcomed
 
and
 
informed.
 
 
3.
 
Promote
 
student
 
choice,
 
autonomy
 
and
 
ownership
 
of
 
social/emotional
 
and
 
academic
 
learning.
 
 
4.
 
Retraining
 
of
 
selected
 
staff
 
and
 
parents
 
on
 
school
 
AED.
 
 
5.
 
Enhance
 
school
 
safety.

The

Department
 
of
 
Education
 
issued
 
guidance
 
to

on
 
August
 
1,
 
2018,
 
regarding
 
how
 
to
 
calculate

Types
 
of
 
Services
 
Funded
 
(Fiscal
 
Year
 
2018-19)
 
 
Using
 
the
 
RtI
 
model,
 
general
 
funds
 
have
 
been
 
focused
 
on
 
professional
 
development
 
for
 
teachers
 
as
 
we
 
work
 
to
 
become
 
a
 
more
 
student
 
centered
 
learning
 
community.
 
Money
 
was
 
allocated
 
for
 
teacher
 
grade
 
level
 
teams
 
to
 
collaborate
 
as
 
a
 
PLC
 
for
 
2
 
full
 
days
 
during
 
the
 
year
 
and
 
meet
 
biweekly
 
as
 
PLCs
 
in
 
grade
 
levels,
 
assess
 
students
 
1:1
 
up
 
to
 
3
 
times
 
a
 
year,
 
and
 
attend
 
both
 
in-district
 
and
 
out-of-district
 
workshops
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
provide
 
excellent
 
Tier
 
1
 
curriculum
 
and
 
instruction.
 
These
 
trainings
 
and
 
PLC
 
opportunities
 
have
 
also
 
supported
 
the
 
development
 
and
 
rigor
 
of
 
Tier
 
2
 
academic
 
work
 
in
 
the
 
classroom.
 
 
School
 
site
 
funds
 
partially
 
paid
 
for
 
Tier

instruction
 
across
 
all

While

funds
 
provided
 
services
 
for
 
reading
 
intervention
 
and
 
ELD
 
daily,
 
pull-out
 
intervention
 
teachers
 
were
 
paid
 
to
 
meet
 
monthly
 
with
 
each
 
grade
 
level
 
team
 
to
 
coordinate
 
Tier
 
1-3
 
support
 
services
 
for
 
identified
 
students.
 
Online
 
programs,
 
such
 
as
 
Lexia,
 
Mystery
 
Science,
 
and
 
Reflex
 
were
 
purchased
 
with
 
site
 
funds,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
SeeSaw,
 
RazKids,
 
and
 
Reading
 
A-Z
 
(thanks
 
to
 
PFC)
 
to
 
support
 
our
 
continuing
 
and
 
innovative
 
instructional
 
practices.
 
iPads,
 
carts,
 
Chromebooks
 
were
 
purchased
 
(largely
 
with
 
PFC
 
funds,
 
though
 
site
 
funds
 
and
 
Donor's
 
Choose
 
grant
 
monies
 
were
 
also
 
used)
 
to
 
enhance
 
internet
 
infrastructure
 
and
 
increase
 
our
 
student:device
 
ratio.
 
Along
 
with
 
the
 
purchase
 
of
 
the
 
math
 
intervention
 
materials
 
to
 
support
 
students
 
in
 
Tier
 
3,
 
site
 
funds
 
also
 
purchased
 
basic
 
supplies
 
to
 
support
 
our
 
daily
 
work,
 
including
 
recess
 
balls
 
and
 
writing
 
journals,
 
and
 
unexciting
 
but
 
crucial
 
items
 
such
 
as
 
printer
 
cartridges.

On
 
the

model,
 
our
 
part-time
 
counselor
 
continued
 
to
 
provide
 
counseling
 
in
 
small
 
groups
 
and
 
individually.
 
She
 
also
 
pushed
 
in
 
to

to
 
support
 
problem-solving
 
and
 
circle
 
work;
 
she
 
served
 
as

and
 
organized
 
our

We
 
have
 
focused
 
on
 
professional
 
development
 
opportunities
 
that
 
help
 
us
 
enhance
 
the
 
rigor
 
of
 
our
 
educational
 
program.
 
Specifically,
 
we
 
strive
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
student-centered,
 
personalized,
 
differentiated,
 
engaging
 
curriculum
 
for
 
every
 
student.
 
Teachers
 
build
 
confidence
 
implementing
 
curriculum
 
and
 
instruction
 
through
 
shared
 
research,
 
discussion,
 
and
 
coaching
 
support.
 
We
 
realized
 
a
 
few
 
years
 
ago
 
that
 
we
 
had
 
to
 
pass
 
through
 
an
 
inevitable
 
chaos
 
period
 
to
 
achieve
 
the
 
transformation
 
we
 
seek,
 
so
 
we
 
try
 
to
 
embrace
 
that
 
process
 
of
 
struggle.
  
We
 
have
 
also
 
given
 
ourselves
 
permission
 
to
 
celebrate
 
our
 
failures
 
because
 
each
 
misstep
 
represents
 
a
 
step
 
towards
 
success.
 
With
 
this
 
philosophical
 
foundation,
 
we
 
began
 
our
 
transformation
 
in
 
the
 
content
 
areas
 
of
 
writing
 
and
 
technology
 
infusion,
 
moved
 
on
 
to
 
reading
 
and
 
NGSS
 
with
 
an
 
engineering
 
emphasis
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
2
 
years,
 
while
 
continuing
 
with
 
our
 
robotics
 
units
 
across
 
grade
 
levels
 
and
 
honing
 
our
 
Reading
 
and
 
Writing
 
Workshop
 
skills
 
with
 
an
 
emphasis
 
in
 
supporting
 
the
 
phonics
 
instruction
 
in
 
the
 
primary
 
grades.
 
This
 
year,
 
we
 
are
 
implementing
 
the
 
new
 
math
 
program.
 
Teachers
 
participated
 
in
 
a
 
two
 
day
 
training
 
at
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
the
 
school
 
year,
 
and

To

we
 
collaborate
 
consistently
 
because
 
this
 
focused
 
time
 
remains
 
a
 
cornerstone
 
of
 
Professional
 
Learning
 
Community
