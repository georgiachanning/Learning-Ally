Principal's Message
 
 
Seated at the base of the Foothills, Cullen, a California Distinguished and Gold Ribbon School, is 
nestled within the neighborhood of central Glendora.  I am very pleased to welcome you to the 
area and to the Cullen family. Cullen Elementary School prides 
itself on being a school where the 
staff, students, and parents work collaboratively as a team, continually evaluating programs to 
ensure that students are receiving the best possible education and developing into individuals with 
integrity. It is this tea
m effort that also provides many additional opportunities for our students to 
experience a well rounded education
 
 
It is clear that we, as educators, both school and parents, must set high expectations for each 
student as well as ourselves in order to effe
ctively foster an attitude of lifelong learning within each 
student and to maintain a high degree of excellence in education.  These high expectations set both 
at school and at home, are most important for a child's success. Concurrently, we must also 
reco
gnize that each child is an individual with unique abilities, strengths, and needs. It is my hope 
that it is the intention of all faculty, staff, and parents of Cullen School to help each student 
appreciate his/her contributions and uniqueness while attain
ing high educational goals.
 
 
With your support, we will continue this pursuit of excellence and working together!
 
 
Cheryl Bonner, Ed.D.
 
Principal

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.
