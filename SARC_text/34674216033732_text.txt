School Description
 
Main Avenue School is part of the Robla School District, which consists of five elementary schools 
and one preschool program, serving over 2,000 students. The district is located within the 
City of 
Sacramento, northeast of the central city. The Robla School District was originally established as 
the Oak Grove School District in the early 1890s. The district's name was changed to Robla School 
District in 1916. Robla is a derivative of the Span
ish word "roble" which means "cluster of British 
Oak trees." During the past school year, Main Avenue School served 373 students in grades 
kindergarten through sixth on a traditional schedule.
 
 

 
It is the mission of Main Avenue School t
o provide students with effective instruction, high quality 
curriculum, and a positive and safe atmosphere where students may achieve at their highest 
potential. The Main Avenue School staff and community will continue to look closely at 
achievement data a
nd evaluate its instructional program. Main Avenue School provides an ideal 

focus is on a strong, academic curriculum and good citizenship at all grade levels. T
he staff strives 
to provide students with an enriched, diverse curriculum, where many cultural celebrations are 
observed. In addition, we will continue to focus on the following important ideas:
 

 
The Main Avenue staff greatly values the role each 

education. Through regular and meaningful communication between home and school, 
students receive the support necessary to make significant gains each year. Providing 
parents with regular reports about their child's progre
ss is a high priority for all 
teachers.
 

 
Teachers use the common core standards as a template for planning and instruction. 
The common core standards also provide teachers with a resource for making 

gram and help teachers 
focus on year
-
end goals appropriate for all students.
 

 


effect
ive lessons. Materials have been adopted in English Language Arts, Mathematics, 
English Language Development, Social Science and Science. Regular assessments which 
are part of these programs as well as other assessments also inform instructional 
planning.
 

 
Interventions are sometimes needed to provide a student with support to help close 
the gap between where they are currently functioning and proficiency with all grade 
level standards. The Main Avenue School staff is committed to developing and 
implementing
 
effective interventions to meet the specific needs of each individual 
student at our school. Such interventions may be provided during the school day as well 
as outside of regular school hours in order to extend learning time. These interventions 
are desi
gned to supplement the core curriculum.
 
 
District Vision Statement
 
Every student reaches their potential in a growth
-
minded environment rich in challenging practices 
and reflective learning for all.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is 
required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (
LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported i
n an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

relationships with our students and their families is a high priority at Main Avenue School. When students feel connected to 
their school, their 
classmates and the staff, they strive to work together cooperatively and everyone can focus on the business of 
learning. To help guide students, Main 
Avenue has three school
-
wide expectations: Respectful, Responsible and Safe. We are in our fifth year of implementing Positive Behavior Intervention 
and Support (PBIS). PBIS continues to guide staff and students in gr
owing a safe community of learners. These expectations and discipline policy are sent

teachers support stud
ents through consistent rewards and consequences. An office disciplinary referral (ODR) form is issued to students who have 
difficulty following school expectations. The ODR is sent home for parents to sign and discuss with their child.  More specif

In the Robla School District, we believe in life
-
long learning, and all staff 
members in the district are given opportunities to continue their learning. It does 
not matter how long you have been working as a teacher, an administrator, as a bus driver or as a custodian, there are still 
new skills to be learned.  This 
is the concept 
behind professional learning days that take place throughout each school year in the Robla School District.
 
 
Each year, the school schedule includes professional learning days for all staff.  The first professional learning day is sch
eduled on the day befo
re the first 
day of school.  The second day is scheduled at the end of the first trimester of the school year.  The third day is scheduled
 
at the end of the second 
trimester of the school year.  Students in the district do not attend school on these days i
n order to allow all staff to participate in learning activities.
 
 
For classified staff, the focus of these learning days is based upon the learning needs of each department in the school dist
rict.  Learning for custodians 
may focus on the correct use of n
ew equipment that has been purchased for use by the custodian in their cleaning duties.  Learning for kitchen staff may 
focus on the use of new equipment or on healthy meal planning or scratch cooking techniques.  Secretaries may focus their lea
rning on ne
w office 
software or on social
-
emotional learning practices for use with students who come to the office.  Each department lead will consider the needs of t
he 
staff, seek input from staff members or may be directed to focus on a specific learning need.  Fo
r example, all staff members at all levels are being training 
in appropriate response techniques in an active shooter situation.  A district team was trained in specific techniques by a c
onsulting firm.  The training 
team then conducts training for differe
nt department staff members on different days during the school year, until all staff members have been trained.
 
 
For certificated staff, teachers, administrators, and specialists, professional learning has focused since the start of the 2
017
-
2018 on speci
fic high impact 
instructional practices.  The Robla School District, in partnership with the Resourcing Excellence in Education (REEd)  Cente
r at the University of California 
at Davis, has defined specific guidelines around effective teaching.  These resea
rch
-
based practices focus on specific teacher behaviors and specific 
student behaviors which increase active learning, language production and higher
-
level thinking in the classroom. Another area of focus is 
Social/Emotional Learning which provides specifi
c strategies for ensuring schools are calm and students feel safe physically and emotionally.
 
 
Professional Learning Support Teachers (PLSTs)then provide on
-
going support for staff as they take these practices back to their classrooms for 
implementation.  
The PLSTs are classroom teachers who work in pairs.  Each pair, one at first grade, one at fourth grade and one at sixth grad
e, offer 
support in a variety of ways.  They might come to a classroom and model a specific teaching practice.  They might serve as
 
a substitute in a classroom to 
allow the teacher to leave and observe another teacher at his/her grade level who has shown exemplary skill with a certain te
aching technique.  They 
might team teach a lesson with a teacher and offer coaching in real
-
time as
 
the lesson is taking place.  PLSTs are available to teachers at all grade levels 
and all levels of experience.  A teacher may contact them directly for support with all practices that are the focus of our p
rofessional learning.
 
 
PLSTs and Principals recei
ve on
-
going training in coaching techniques to ensure that they are gaining skill in effective practices for supporting teachers.  
Special coaching training sessions take place throughout the school year.  Specific techniques are discussed and coaches are 
then encouraged to put 
them into practice.  Follow
-
up training sessions allow coaches to share their experiences and refine their skills.
 
 
Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) are also at the core of professional learning for all certificated staff.  P
LC training was provided to all teachers 
and administrators during the 2017
-
2018 school year.  Our system has been designed to allow teachers to meet in PLC teams throughout the school year.  
Classroom teachers meet in grade
-
level teams at their school on 
a weekly basis when their students are in enrichment activities with enrichment teachers.

In addition, District
-
wide PLC meetings are held once a trimester where all teachers at a grade level are able to meet together as a PLC focused on
 
the 
needs of that
 
specific grade level.  Principals and PLSTs also support this work as they provide coaching to PLC teams as needed or as requ
ested.
 
 
Additional Professional Learning activities are offered to all staff after the end of the school day.  The focus of these 
trainings is based upon the needs of 
staff.  Recent focus areas for teachers include technology in the classroom, social
-
emotional learning, and foundation skills in English Language Arts.  All 
staff members at all levels are also invited to Resilience tra
ining, which takes place throughout the school year after school.  Resilience focuses on the 
relationships we have with the members of the community we serve with a special emphasis on cultural sensitivity.  This work 
is done in consultation 
with the Rober
ts Family Development Center and our Resilience consultant, Dr. Sara Truebridge.
