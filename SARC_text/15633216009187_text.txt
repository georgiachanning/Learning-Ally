Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority:
 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Cali
fornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alterna
te achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for 
entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

We believe that our 
parents/guardians are an extremely important and integral part of student learning at Wayside School. 
Wayside parents/guardians participate in a number of organizations including: School Site Council, District Advisory 
Committee, District English Learners 
Advisory Committee, and award winning Family and Community Engagement 
program. We provide a variety of educational opportunities for our parents/guardians such as classes in nutrition, 
navigating the school systems, and parenting skills. Our Principal, Dr.

Number of school 
days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Professional development is designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for administrators, teachers, and 
classified personnel. Training opportunities affirm the basic 
philosophy of education that learning is a lifelong process that 
contributes to the well
-
being of the students, teachers, administrators, and community. Professional Development is an 
essential component of effective instruction and student learning.
 
 
All 
training revolves around identified needs of students and adults for the purpose of the improvement of instruction and 
increasing content knowledge. Central to all training are student achievement data, district focus areas, the Common Core 
State Standards
, the state adopted standards
-
based instructional materials, and strategies to effectively teach the 
academic content standards to all students.
 
 
We also provided extensive professional development for Professional Learning Communities through our Service 
Delivery 
Model. On
-
site coaching and support is provided by academic coaches and district specialists for reading/language arts, 
mathematics, science, writing and social emotional learning. The district provides time and resources for collaboration, 
planni
ng, and professional development. Additionally, we provided professional development on Multi
-
Tiered Systems of 
Support and Support to school and district teams.
 
 
Teachers new to the District received four days of professional development prior to the begi
nning of the school year 
focused on orientation to District and school site policies and services, Common Core State Standards, classroom 
management, curriculum and pacing, using technology and setting up the classroom. Teachers in their second year with 
t
he District received two days of professional development prior to the beginning of the school year provided by the school 
site and focused on improving best practices.

New teachers with California preliminary credentials received professional development
 
through the Bakersfield City 
School District (BCSD) Teacher Induction Program (TIP). The focus of BCSD TIP is being mentored by an experienced 
teacher, growing in the California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP) and meeting the California Induc
tion 
standards. The culmination of TIP is the recommendation for the CA Clear Credential. Each TIP teacher was assigned a 
veteran teacher who served as a mentor. The mentors received on
-
going professional development in 
coaching/mentoring strategies, instr
uctional strategies, and guiding cycles of inquiry. Professional development was 
provided through individual mentoring, monthly meetings, and after
-
school workshops.
 
 
Intern teachers received professional development at monthly meetings focusing on the ini
tial teaching skills of the CSTP 
including classroom management, lesson planning, assessment, and establishing a climate that is conducive to student 
achievement. Each Intern was assigned a mentor that provided day
-
to
-
day support in these areas as well as 
advisement 
toward meeting credential requirements. Mentors received monthly professional development in meeting the needs of 
Intern teachers. Interns also received coursework and supervision from universities partnered with BCSD to provide the 
Intern Progr
am.
 
 
Teachers on Short Term Staffing Permits (STSPs) were provided mentors and monthly trainings on beginning pedagogy 
and best teaching practices. Each teacher on a STSP designed a plan to meet requirements to move to a CA Intern or 
Preliminary Credential
. Support was provided for required testing and BCSD staff worked closely with university partners 
to ensure teachers on permits were taking prerequisite requirements to move to credentials.
 
 
Teachers on Provisional Intern Permits (PIPs) were provided a we
ekly cohort meeting focused on beginning pedagogy. 
Two cohort meetings occurred weekly to allow teachers on a PIP to work around university course schedules. Support was 
provided for required testing and BCSD staff worked closely with university partners t
o ensure teachers on permits were 
taking prerequisite requirements to move to credentials.
