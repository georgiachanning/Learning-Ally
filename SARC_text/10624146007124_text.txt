By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Sanger Un
ified retains an independent contractor to provide comprehensive facilities inspection of every school site. This 
inspection meets or exceeds the criteria of the State of California Williams inspection requirement. The Williams 
compliance inspections are d
one by Fresno County Office of Education (FCOE). Only one SUSD site is inspected by Fresno 
County Office of Education annually for Williams compliance. This site is not a FCOE inspected site. The most recent 
inspection, either district or Williams, availab
le when this SARC is prepared is utilized for this report. Inspection reports 
are maintained at the SUSD District Office.
 
 
The rating scale used for this inspection is as follows:
 
 
99% 
-
 
100% = Exemplary: School meets most/all standards of good 
repair. Noted deficiencies, if any, are not significant.
 
 
90% 
-
 
98.99% = Good: School maintained in good repair with some isolated deficiencies from wear/tear or  are being 
mitigated.
 
 
75% 
-
 
89.99% = Fair: School is not in good repair with some critical or
 
widespread deficiencies and repairs are necessary.
 
 
00% 
-
 
74.99% = Poor: School facilities are in poor condition with deficiencies of various degrees throughout and major 
repairs are necessary.
 
 
The results of the most recent report available for this 
campus are disaggregated below.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Our school maintains a very active Boosters Club.  The Fairmont Boosters works to 
support school wide and individual 
classroom activities.  This has often taken the form of support for Red Ribbon Week, a School Carnival and various holiday 
activities such as Halloween contests and Santa visits. We welcome volunteers as general help in t
he office or for specific 
service in a classroom.  Anyone wishing to become a member of our Boosters club may obtain an application at our Office.  
We also have parents serving in elective positions on our School Site Council (SSC) and English Language Adv
isory 
Committee, which monitor our use of School Improvement (SI) funds and other categorical funds.  Meetings are held 
throughout the year and all meetings are open to the public.   Please contact our office if you are interested in becoming 
more involved
 
in your children's education. The campus received its funding and added benches, a new campus sign, 
landscaping and other ancillary improvements.  Fairmont has also focused on improving parent awareness and 
involvement through Parent Forums.  Parent Forum
s are meetings open to the community and families that focus on 
topics such as, i.e., Early Literacy, or High School and College.  These forums help foster communication and empower 
parents better understand Fairmont School.

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Fairmont School has a Safe School Plan that is reviewed and updated annually.  Plans are reviewed with staff annually 
often at the beginning of each School Year.   Fairmont's School Site Council (SSC) approves our Safe School Plan. 
 
Emergency drills are conducted to prepare students and staff in the event of an emergency.  We strive to maintain a safe, 
healthful, nurturing and orderly school campus that encourages positive attitudes in students and staff.  A joint effort 
between stud
ents and staff help keep the campus clean and litter free.  Site maintenance staff surveys their campus as 
the first order of business each day.   They insure the campus is clean, any vandalism is corrected, and that the campus is 
presentable and represent
ative of the priority Sanger School Board sets on safety and appearance.  Oversight of Sanger 
Unified Safe School Plans is through the Welfare and  Attendance Officer.

Number of school

What are the primary/major areas of focus for staff development and specifically how were they selected? For example, 
were student achievement data used to determine the need for 
professional development in reading instruction?
 
 
All of our professional development is based on the needs of our students and teachers, assessed through observations, 
surveys, disaggregation of SBAC data, PBIS data and other assessment data. Teachers in 
Sanger Unified have completed 
professional training courses designed to support educational priorities and objectives. Staff Development Days are 
designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for administrators, teachers and classified personnel.
 
 
What are the methods by which professional development is delivered (e.g., after school workshops, conference 
attendance, individual mentoring, etc.)?
 
 
As a district, we are committed to offering teachers a variety of professional learning opportunities an
d options for 
personalized professional development. Sanger Unified provides professional learning in all subjects (Math, STEAM, ELA, 
ELD, assessments etc.) for TK
-
6th grade teachers throughout the school year. For single
-
subject teachers, Sanger Unified 
p
rovides two to four full days of training dedicated to specific initiatives, strategies and frameworks (Balanced Literacy, 
Guaranteed and Viable Instruction, ELD, Writing, Speaking and Listening, Close Reading, Project Based Learning, Universal 
Design for 
Learning, etc.) Sanger Unified also offers after
-
school workshops on various math instructional strategies and 
routines, after
-
school technology trainings and Universal Design for Learning trainings. Each year, we offer a district 
conference where teachers
 
share their best practices with one another. Teacher leaders at all sites are given a variety of 
opportunities to attend national and state conferences and seminars, as to further the collective knowledge of all 
members of their grade level teams and lear
ning communities. Teachers also have the opportunity to engage in 
personalized professional development through instructional coaching.
 
 
New to the profession Teachers are also supported through the Sanger Unified School District Beginning Teacher Support 
and Assessment Induction Program (BTSA) and New Teacher Support. A teacher that is teaching under a PIP or STSP, or is 
an Intern is assigned a mentor that provides the new teacher with a minimum of 4 hours per week of direct or indirect 
support for his/her
 
individualized professional growth. In addition, the teachers attend required professional development 
provided by the district and school site. New teachers that have a preliminary credential participate in our formal BTSA 
Induction Program. Teachers par
ticipating in BTSA receive support from a trained support provider for two years. The

eachers in their individualized professional growth plans. New 
teachers, along with their mentors (support providers) attend 4 Network meetings together over the 2 years. In addition, 
the program may offer additional professional development offerings base
d on participant request and through surveys 
that include the following: Classroom Management, Conducting Parent Teacher Conferences/Parent communication, 
Meeting the needs of special needs students, Technology, Writing, etc. Sanger Unified's BTSA Inductio
n Program provides 
support and assessment opportunities for all first and second year Participating Teachers to increase understanding of 
their own professional development, which will enable them to more effectively meet the diverse learning needs of thei
r 
students. The mentors, called support providers, are trained in cognitive coaching, working with adult learners, and FACT. 
Support Providers attend a two
-
day training their first year and a one day Refresher every year after. In addition SPs are 
required
 
to attend an orientation, and 2 after school trainings each year to work on their mentoring skills.

How are teachers supported during implementation (e.g., through in
-
class coaching, teacher
-
principal meetings, student 
performance data reporting, etc.)
? With so many district initiatives, it is essential to have support for all teachers and 
administrators during implementation. Through many of our contracted trainings (Balanced Literacy, NGSS, UDL), our 
expert trainers provide on
-
site support and follow 
up personalized coaching. There are varied levels of support, both at 
the site and district level. At school sites, teachers are supported during implementation by their grade
-
level or content 
colleagues through Professional Learning Communities. In additi
on, Curriculum Support Providers, Literacy Specialist 
Teachers, (Teachers on Special Assignment) and administrators provide on site support. District support is provided at the 
PLC level through collaborative unit/lesson planning and facilitated curriculum
 
curating experiences.
 
 
All of our professional development is based on our students and teachers needs. Teachers in Sanger Unified have 
completed professional training courses designed to support educational priorities and objectives. Staff 
Development 
Days are designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for administrators, teachers and classified personnel.
 
 
Sanger Unified uses Staff Development Days and support from site level Curriculum Support Providers and district level 
Distri
ct Instructional Specialists to assist teachers in classroom instructional strategies. The district provided a strong base 
for Common Core English Language Arts Implementation over the last few years through professional development 
focused on academic voc
abulary, content reading and writing, and unpacking standards. This year the district will provide 
an extensive Math training on the mathematical practices, math tasks, and academic discourse. Further English Language 
Arts professional development will foc
us on writing mini lessons and units.
 
 
New to the profession Teachers are also supported through the Sanger Unified School District Beginning Teacher Support 
and Assessment Induction Program (BTSA). Teachers participating in BTSA receive support from a tra
ined support provider 
for two years. The Sanger BTSA program uses the Formative Assessment for California Teachers (FACT) formative 
assessment to guide "new" teachers in their professional growth. The Sanger BTSA program also provides a menu of 
professiona
l development opportunities for BTSA Participating Teachers, Support Providers, and invites all teachers in the 
district to participate, if the topic meets their need. The menu of professional development offerings include the following:
 
Classroom Manageme
nt, Conducting Parent Teacher Conferences/Parent communication, Meeting the needs of special 
needs students, Technology, UDL, Writing, etc. Sanger Unified's BTSA Induction Program provides support and assessment 
opportunities for all first and second year 
Participating Teachers to increase understanding of their own professional 
development, which will enable them to more effectively meet the diverse learning needs of their students.
 
 
In addition to staff development days, teachers participate in workshops 
and conferences on the following: Literacy 
Strategies, Writing, Reading and Literacy Training, and ongoing SBE textbook adoption in
-
services are provided throughout 
the first 2
-
years of a curriculum, text implementation period. In
-
services in Effective Ins
tructional Strategies, Professional 
Learning Communities, and strategies for English Learners are also provided.
