By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Helen Estock Elementary was named to honor an eighth grade history teacher in the district (1940
-
1961). The school is 
located on 12.4 acres near Old Town 
Tustin and was opened in 1964.  In June 2016, nearby Lambert Elementary School 
was closed and 300 students, as well as nine teachers, became part of the Estock campus and community.  Helen Estock 
Elementary educates 513 students in kindergarten through fif
th grades, 92% whom are Hispanic/Latino, 56% English 
Learners, and 98% Economically Disadvantaged.
 
 
The Estock Elementary community is dedicated to mindfully and compassionately engaging, elevating, and supporting all 
learners.  Our mission statement at He
len Estock Elementary School is to create a rich and rigorous learning environment 
that reaches all learners.  We foster a safe and positive community where scholars take ownership of their learning, take 
risks, persevere, reflect, and collaborate.  We, th
e parents, students, and staff, commit to empower each other on our 
journey to success.
 
 
Strong achievement for all students is the highest priority for Tustin Unified School District, therefore the 2019
-
2020 focus 
goal, based on the results of our Compreh
ensive Needs Assessment, is to ensure Multi
-
tiered systems of support are 
developed and implemented to address academic, behavioral, attendance, and social
-
emotional needs of all students as 
they engage in a standards
-
based, rigorous academic program.  Est
ock Elementary is committed to maintaining and 
developing strong/strategic Tier 1 instruction and Tier 2 systems of support for continuous improvement and achievement 
in all academic areas, for all students with a specific lens on at
-
risk subgroups, includ
ing English Language Learners, 
Students With Disabilities and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged.  Based on the focused goal, there are twelve actions in 
place to increase/improve services for Estock Elementary.  These actions, in the areas of staff, technolo
gy, parent 
education, resources, and professional development, are focused on increasing and improving core instruction, 
interventions, parent involvement, and student well
-
being.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Tustin Unified School District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are 
clean, safe, and functional. To assist in 
this effort, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School 
Construction (OPSC). The results of this survey are available at the school office, the Distr
ict office, or on the Internet at 
https://tinyurl.com/TUSD

Tool. The District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to 
keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order proces
s is used to 
ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
The Helen Estock Campus is located on a 12
-
acre property which was opened in 1964.  The campus currently houses 
approximately 515 students. The facility is cl
ean and well maintained through the service of two custodians and the district 
maintenance staff.  The staff, students, and parents take great pride in the appearance of our 50+ year
-
old school. The 
Helen Estock school community respects our property and m
akes every effort to keep the facility clean at all times.  All 
areas were 100% and the overall rating was exemplary.  On

going routine maintenance is performed as needs are 
identified.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State pr
iority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There are many 
opportunities in the district for parental involvement through participation in parent surveys, support 
organizations, booster clubs, school site councils, DELAC and district
-
level advisory committees with the superintendent.
 
 
Parents at Estock Elementary 
School participate in our Parent, Teacher Association (PTA), School Site Council (SSC), English 
Language Advisory Council (ELAC), District English Language Advisory Council (DELAC), Gifted and Talented Education 
(GATE) Committee, and the Superintendent's A
dvisory Council.
 
 

in academic success. Our Parent/Student/Teacher Compact emphasizes the partnerships between home and school, and 
is
 
developed, signed and supported by the Estock school community. Parents are kept informed with bilingual school 
messages through SMORE and classroom newsletters and communications through Seesaw.
 
 
Estock Elementary uses categorical funds to support famili
es by hiring a community liaison to outreach to our most 
underrepresented subgroups. The school principal and community liaison collaborate to create and maintain a strong link 
between the school and home for our most at risk students by working closely wi
th the teaching staff and supportive 
adults in the lives of our students.
 
 
Our main focus is to increase participation in community services, non
-
profit organizations, and our own Parent Teacher 
Association. Currently, the Tustin Assistance League provides
 
uniforms, Padres en Accion provides parent training in health 
and nutrition, Families Forward provides backpacks, as well as Christmas and Thanksgiving baskets, for our families, and 
the Community Action Partnership helps families receive food stamps.  In
 
addition, for this school year we have partnered 
with Shoes that Fit, providing free pairs of shoes, Second Harvest Food Bank, to provide a monthly free farmers market to 
our community, and Team Kids, which empowers our students to support our greater com
munity through weekly 
challenges.  These outreach efforts encourage parent involvement on our campus.
 
 
Additionally, the following opportunities available for parent involvement include: Author's Tea Celebrations, PTA 
membership, English Learner Advisory C
ouncil, School Site Council, room parents, Family Movie Nights, Friday folders, 
Estock School News SMORE, classroom newsletters/Seesaw communication, Parent/Teacher Conferences in Fall and 
Spring, Guys/Gals Nights, STEM Night, Social Emotional Learning nig
ht, Open House, fundraising opportunities, and PTA 
events. Translators and interpreters are used as needed at events/activities.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018

Estock Elementary School receives categorical funding in the areas of Title I and Local Control Funding Formula 
-
 
ELL. All 
categorical expenditures are monitored and approved for appropriate alignment to the SPSA and program guidelines by 
multiple centralized support personnel within Tustin Unified School District. Rationales for expenditures must be provided, 
aligned, and app
roved prior to purchase and use. These safeguards of fiscal support allow us to provide the necessary and 
appropriate support for our under
-
performing students.
 
 
The majority of site categorical funding is used for supplemental student interventions, staff
 
development, personnel 
costs, and student/teacher technology in the classroom. Staff development is focused on targeting skill instruction and 
providing in
-
services on research based best practices in the core instructional areas related to writing, Profe
ssional 
Learning Communities (PLCs), supporting students at
-
risk for retention, supporting students who are English learners, 
building relationships with students and connectedness to school, and varied parent education. Personnel costs include 
Multi
-
Tiere
d Systems of Support (MTSS) staff to support student success, and a portion of the Community Liaison's salary 
to support connections with our parent community. Supplemental materials to address needs were also purchased to 
support English/Language Arts, Ma
thematics, English Language Development, Student Wellness and School/Community 
Partnerships.

Tustin Unified School District provides dedicated time 
for professional development for all staff.  Schools often provide 
additional professional development time based on specific school
-
site scheduling and budgetary decisions.  The District 
provides intensive workshops in August during the week before school
 
starts to provide teachers with new knowledge 
and enhanced skills for the upcoming year.  Staff development opportunities are also offered after school and by release 
time throughout the school year.  Additionally, professional development is provided one
 
non
-
student day in the fall and 
one afternoon per month after school.  New teachers are provided an extensive new teacher training program throughout 
the year to support their implementation of effective instruction.Estock staff development is designed to
 
meet the 
Common Core State Standards with an emphasis on personalization and the use of classroom technology to support 21st
-
century teaching and learning. Teachers work in Professional Learning Communities (PLC) to analyze student data and 
develop site
-
b
ased assessments to target student needs. In addition to professional learning around content standards, 
teachers continue to work on incorporating 21st
-
century teaching strategies into their daily instruction by utilizing 
resources found on the TUSD Curri
culum Google sites provided by the Tustin Unified School District.  Teachers access 
valuable resources on these sites, and through collaboration with colleagues, develop rich lessons that transform their 
classroom learning environments to meet individual s
tudent needs.
 
 
Each grade level utilizes District created phase and standards guides for the pacing of units of study in English language 
arts and Mathematics.  These guides align with District assessments and allow for continuity of instruction. At the 
be
ginning of the school year, grade level teams create a yearlong projected path for reading and writing, which outlines 
specific units of study and tentative dates.  This projection remains flexible and fluid, in order to meet specific student 
needs.  Data 
is reviewed with each common assessment to adjust/provide targeted and individualized instructional 
support for students and adjust curricular projections.
