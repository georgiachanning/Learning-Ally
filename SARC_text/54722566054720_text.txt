Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Washington 
Elementary School takes great efforts to ensure a safe, clean, and functional physical environment for 
students, staff, and volunteers. Sufficient space is provided for students and staff to support teaching and learning. This 
includes space provided by cl
assrooms, resource room, library/computer lab, playgrounds, and staff work rooms. To assist 
our school in this effort, the district uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Publ
ic 
School Construction. The results of 
this survey are available at the district office. Additional information about the 
condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by speaking with the school principal.

Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs neces
sary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
In 2017
-
18, there were no major needs for repai
r at Washington Elementary School. No other emergency facilities needs 
exist at this school.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
In addition to custodial staff on duty during the school day, a team of maintenance specialists come in after hours for daily
 
cleani
ng. District and school maintenance staff work cooperatively with administrators to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Program
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, whic
h provides state matching funds on a 
dollar for dollar basis to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school build
ing 
components.  Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electr
ical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. The deferred maintenance program ensures that all class¬¨rooms and facilities are maintained 
to a degree of adequacy that allows for a good learning environment.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. 
Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilitie
s); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priori
ty: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parent involvement and 
communication are essential to our school success.  Washington Elementary School continually 
strives to involve parents by sharing information that helps parents understand as well as support school programs and 
by providing opportunities for parent partic
ipation in school activities. VUSD Parent University classes such as P.I.Q.E 
(Parent Institute for Quality Education), Latino Literacy Program, and School Smarts are offered on campus.
 
 
There are numerous and varied opportunities for parent involvement, in
cluding but not limited to attending school 
functions such as Back to School Night, Open House, participating in parent
-
teacher conferences, and other similar school 
activities. Parents are also encouraged to volunteer in classrooms, chaperone field trips,
 
and support our competitive 
teams. Sign up to Dojo is available for all classrooms where parents can stay in touch with each of their student's teachers 
and see what is happening in their classrooms. Parents may also serve on advisory committees including
, but not limited
