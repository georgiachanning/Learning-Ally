About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

A District committee considers textbooks for recommendation on a cycle established by the State Board of Education and from a
 
State adopted list.  The 
committee meets to discuss current issues relevant 
to the subject matter, including student success, previously used textbooks, and instructional 
methods.  The committee reviews demonstration copies of proposed textbooks, as well as listen to representatives describe the
 
various highlights of the 
available
 
materials.  The review is followed by a pilot of materials that results in consensus by the committee of a recommended textbo
ok.  The textbook 
is forwarded to a K
-
12 Curriculum Council, which consists of teachers, parents, and community stakeholders, for 
review and approval.  If the textbook is 
approved by the K
-
12 Curriculum Council, the textbook is forwarded to the Superintendent and the Governing Board for their review and approval.
  
Each 
pupil in the district, including English learners, kindergarten t
hrough grade twelve, is provided with standards
-
aligned textbooks or basic instructional 
materials that are consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framework adopted by the State Board.
 
 
AB 1246, added Education Code Section 60210, which a
llows the district to use any instructional materials, not just state
-
adopted, as long as they are 
aligned with the academic content standards.  The EC 60119 has a new section (e) with a reference to the Common Core State St
andards (CCSS).  The 
section sta

ndards, it is the 
intent of the Legislature that textbooks, instructional materials, and supplemental instructional materials be de
emed to be aligned with the content 
standards pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (c), and be deemed consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framew
ork adopted by the state 
board pursuant to subdivision (a) if the textbooks, instructional mate
rials, supplemental instructional materials, or a combination of any such materials 

ed to either the 1997 
standards or the 2010 CCS
S standards for mathematics and English Language Arts are compliant with Williams Act requirements.  In accordance with 
Education Code Section 60422(a) and 60119, the Governing Board certified on 9/3/2019 that each pupil in the district, includi
ng English 
learners, in 
kindergarten through grade twelve, has been provided with standards

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical
