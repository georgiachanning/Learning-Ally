Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The mission of Pleasant Valley Middle School is to provide academically rigorous curriculum by promoting and challenging 
the intellectual, creative, physical, and social development of middle school students.  Our students wear their school 
colo

students start each day with our daily motivational quote and "Go Timber Wolves!"
 
 
Pleasant Valley was identified as a California Disting
uished School in 2002 by the California Department of Education. We 
serve 150 students in grades 6

Sierra foothills, 10 miles southeast of Placerville.  Pleasant Va

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.

Each year, School Site Council reviews and provides input regarding the School Safety Plan.  The plan is evaluated and 
updated annually based on the input from the council as well as other stakeholders, including staff. After input, the Safety 
Plan Is pres
ented to the Board each March.  The main goals of the Safety Plan include: Creating a safe, positive learning 
environment; creating a physical environment that is safe and friendly; creating a school culture that is safe, welcoming, 
and filled with kindnes
s and compassion. Goals were developed after a review of data from parent and student surveys.

The School Safety Plan also incorporates district policies that assist staff and students with campus safety, fire drills, 
earthquake preparedness, lockdown dri
lls, and cafeteria and playground supervision.
 
 
Three lunchtime supervisors are employed to promote safety in the cafeteria and on the playground during lunch recess. 
Fire drills are monitored each month, intruder drills are conducted multiple times per ye
ar, and disaster drills are 
conducted during the year. A bus evacuation drill and other emergency drills are also carried out each year. Coaching and 
office staff are trained to administer CPR and first aid as are every teacher and administrator on campus.
 
Additionally, the 
school nurse works one day per week assisting office personnel, staff, students, and parents with health concerns. All 
efforts to ensure building safety, cleanliness, and adequacy have been successful.  Multiple staff members are trained
 
in 
how to shut off the various utilities in the event of an emergency.  Administration works collaboratively with the County 
Office and local law enforcement on school safety measures. The administration attends regular SCALE
-
School, 
Community and Law Enf
orcement meetings to collaborate with the latest safety information with our local law 
enforcement.

In GOUSD, there is one full day dedicated to staff development before the school year begins. In addition to this full day, 
Pleasant Valley also has one early release day per week where the afternoons are 
dedicated to staff development. Staff 
development is selected based on the needs determined through our state dashboard data and surveys of staff needs. 
Staff development occurs though in class peer coaching, professional workshops, conference attendance a
nd mini staff 
led workshops during our early release collaboration time.  Professional development continues yearly in supporting 
teachers in mathematics and language arts instruction.  With the adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards, 
science te
achers will be taking part in professional development to support the implementation of these standards. Lead 
teachers have been trained in UDL (Universal Design for Learning) to support all curricular areas and additional teachers 
will be trained this yea
r. In addition to curricular areas, staff development will focus on ongoing culture and climate work 
including inservice on PBIS (Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports) and Love and Logic. The staff will also take part
 
in training in MTSS
--
Multi
-
ti
ered System of Support which will focus on quality first instruction and levels of academic, 
behavioral and social
-
emotional support. In addition to staff development offered through our district, staff is also 
encouraged to attend professional development
 
hosted by the El Dorado County Office of Education as well as through 
other learning opportunities over the summer and during the school year.
