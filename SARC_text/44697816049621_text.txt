About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC
 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which d
escribes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructi
onal Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Pacific School District endeavors to provide sufficient and current textbooks and materials to support instructional programs
. Pacific School District held 
a Public Hearing on September 18, 2018, and determined that the
 
school has sufficient and good quality textbooks and instructional materials pursuant 
to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California.
 
 
All students, including English Learners, are given their own standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional ma
terials, or both, in core subjects for use in 
the classroom and to take home. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the District are aligned with the Calif
ornia State Content Standards 
and Frameworks. Textbooks and supplementary materials a
re adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making 
the textbooks used in the school the most current available. The table displays information collected in September 2019 about
 
the quality, currency, and 
availabilit
y of the standards

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The physical environment of Pacific School is continually maintained to the best of our ability. Classrooms and 
grounds are kept free of litter and graffiti. 
Students are expected to participate in daily cleanup.  The playground, classrooms, fire extinguishers, and emergency exit li
ghts are formally inspected 
at least monthly.  Repairs to damage are made as quickly 
as possible. The principal conducts at least two comprehensive inspections a year, in the fall 
and spring, using the inspection checklist from the State Office of Public School Construction. The inspection covers the sch
ool site, including office, 
classroo
ms, kitchen,and playground safety.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education populat
ion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are

C. Engagement
 
 
State 
Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each scho
ol site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Pacific Elementary School values parents as an integral part of the educational process.  To that end, the following is a sum
mary of our three major areas 
for parental involvement: volun
teering in the classroom, chaperoning on field trips and during events; supporting the Pacific School Foundation/Pacific 
School Parents' Club; and serving in governance capacities such as the School Site Council or Board of Trustees.
 
 
Parents are vitally i
mportant to Pacific School and the school actively encourages their participation. Parents overwhelmingly say they feel welco
me and 

room on a regular basis. 
Classroom volunteer needs are discussed each year at Back
-
to
-
School Night.  In our Independent Studies Program, which is a hybrid of homeschooling 
and a traditional school program, parents are the teachers of their own and each oth
ers' children.  Field trips are frequent and parents are crucial to their 
smooth functioning.  Some field trips, for the older students, involve multi
-
day excursions and depend upon actively involved parents to make them 
possible.
 
 
The Pacific School Found

 
is 
responsible for coordinating several large fundraisers, managing donations, organizing family/community events such as Potato
 
N
ight and Bingo Night. 
PSF/PSPC is always eager to recruit new members to maintain and invigorate a culture of active support.
 
 
The School Site Council (SSC) is made up of five parent/community members and five staff members. The Site Council is respons
ible
 
for revising and 
recommending several important plans that provide direction for the school in key areas.  The SSC reviews the Local Control A
ccountability Plan (LCAP), 
the Comprehensive School Safety Plan, the Wellness Plan, and the Technology Plan. They
 
also act as an advisory committee to the school board. The Site 
Council is also responsible for surveying parents to determine concerns and program needs.  In this capacity, parent members 
serve as a link between 
parents, staff, and the governing board. W
hen there is an empty seat available on the Site Council, all parents are encouraged to participate in the 
election of a new member.  All meetings are open to the public.  The School Board is composed of three elected members.  Thei
r job is to set policy f
or 
the school district and to direct the Superintendent/Principal in implementing those policies.

Parents who have special skills are encouraged to share their expertise with the children as demonstrations and lessons durin
g school hours.  Also, 
parents s
ometimes seek the opportunity to give classes to students after school. The school is happy to provide support for these clas
ses when scheduling 
and spaces are available.  In the past, parents have given lessons in art, dance, sewing, knitting, Spanish, mu
sic, and drama.  Parents are also actively 
involved in helping to meet needs in the school library, Life Lab garden, landscaping, and maintenance.  Indeed, our school c
ommunity would be notably 
deficient without their continued generosity.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Pacific School District has 
developed a comprehensive School Safety Plan that addresses the emotional safety as well as the physical safety of all member
s 
of the school community. The School Safety Plan was developed by the Safety Committee in conjunction with the Pacific School 
Site
 
Council, which is 
made up of parents and staff members.  The Plan is reviewed and revised annually by both the Site Council and the School Boar
d.  It is then submitted 
to the County Office of Education.  The School Safety Plan is available for viewing in

fashion.  First, the needs are 
identified during the previous year.  Second, t
he teachers and the principal meet monthly to discuss needs, review research and share best practices. 
Any new opportunities are discussed at that time. Third, the subcommittees of teachers meet to work on various aspects of imp
roving our practice.  The 
wo
rk of these groups is then brought to the entire faculty for implementation.  Assessments of student progress and staff stren
gths and competencies 
are considered when professional development is planned.
 
 
Recommendations from the School Board and the Schoo
l Site Council are considered when planning activities. Staff members are encouraged to 
participate in professional development programs offered by the Santa Cruz County Office of Education.  Special Education sta
ff and aides have taken 
advantage of severa
l workshops offered through the county SELPA.  Pacific School staff members collaborate with the other three small school dis
tricts 
in the county for at least one professional development day per year.  Whenever possible, the principal takes part in profes
sional development programs 
along with staff members.
 
 
Teachers are provided with release time to attend special workshops and classes, and time is allowed at staff meetings and in
-
service days for staff 
members to share information they have gained that w
ill benefit other staff members. Mentor teachers provide expertise in areas of strength and the 

 
 
Since the 2011

l development days are scheduled in coordination with the three other small school districts to collaborate 
and share best practices. The staff continues to assess needs and either take advantage of minimum days every Wednesday or ta
ke individual staff 
dev
elopment opportunities to attend workshops. The staff has focused on math, writing, science (including the Life Lab garden cu
rriculum), English 
Language Development, and differentiating instruction to meet the needs of gifted students. Other staff developm
ent topics include Step Up To Writing, 
the Common Core Standards implementation, Environmental Education, Next Generation Science Standards, and the Visual And Perf
orming Arts (VAPA) 
standards.

ed with a private consultant (Rebecca Setziol) to provide professional development in 
mathematics instruction.  Specifically, Ms. Setziol coached teachers in Teaching Through Problem Solving, using a gradual rel
ease of responsibility model.
 
 
A restructured
 
weekly schedule with four longer days and a shorter day on Wednesdays provides time for weekly meetings and collaboration, as
 
well as 
the development of curriculum and materials in each classroom.
 
 
The school participates in the state

sponsored Beginning 
Teachers Support and Assessment Program (BTSA), as appropriate. The goals of the BTSA 
program are to help new teachers succeed, foster increased retention of quality teachers within the teaching profession, and 
improve instruction for 
students.
