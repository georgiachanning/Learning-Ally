School Description
 
At Hidden Valley School, we are very proud of the warm camaraderie that exists among our staff 
and parents, and the strong focus on learning and citizenship that we maintain. Our talented 
teachers and support staff take great pride in t
heir work and are focused on ensuring that Hidden 
Valley keeps the focus on our students, providing a program of academic excellence, cultural 
richness, social, emotional and physical development that educates, supports, challenges and 
inspires each child.
 
Our phenomenal PTO and YES Foundation continually supports the school to 
allow combined efforts to provide the quality educational experience all students deserve. 
 
 
Our school is located in a quiet valley, nestled against open space with gorgeous view s 
of Mt. 
Tamalpais. Hidden Valley School opened in 1954 and is one of five schools in the Ross Valley School 
District. Ross Valley School District, in general, and Hidden Valley, in particular, is a community that 
nurtures and treasures its children. It is b
ecause of this that the community is committed to the 
support of a rich educational experience. Parents, teachers, local businesses and children have all 
become partners in this mission. This cooperative spirit creates our unique Hidden Valley Family. 
The 
welcoming school environment and culture are qualities that our families enjoy. 
 
 
Our teachers and students are the heart of our school community. We have a school population of 
about 320 students, TK through fifth grade. The welcoming school environment a
nd culture are 
qualities about Hidden Valley that our families enjoy. Our education program is supported by 14 
regular education teachers, a Resource Specialist and special education staff as well as Music, Art, 
Library and PE classes. 
 
 
We encourage paren
ts to become an active participant in the life of Hidden Valley School. There 
are many ways to become involved in school programs and activities: working with the PTO and its 
many programs and projects; participating in School Site Council; supporting YES;
 
working as a 
classroom volunteer; or attending the various community functions. 
 
 
SCHOOL DESCRIPTION 
 
Hidden Valley School w as constructed in 1957 with seven classrooms. As our community grew , 
additional classroom were added. In 2000, a new office buil
ding and Gym/MPR were built and older 
classrooms were modernized with upgraded heating and air conditioning, as well as provisions for 
accessibility, and Internet connectivity. In 2017, utilizing bond money, 3 classrooms were added to 
our campus, along wit
h a new K
-
5 play structure, resurfaced blacktop, sidewalks, grading, and 
landscaping. Sharing our site is a non
-
profit operated before
-
and
-
after school day care. 
 
 
Our campus is a community
-
oriented facility 
-
 
used after hours for childcare and scout meeti
ngs. 
The school fields are shared with San Anselmo Recreation Department so that Hidden Valley 
facilities can be utilized for community recreational programming. Upkeep of our school grounds 
and gardens is a shared responsibility between community organiza
tions, parent volunteers and 
the school district staff. Our Parent Teacher Organization Board aligns yearly goals with our school 
improvement plan to provide additional support and materials to ensure student success. The PTO 
actively solicits participatio
n from the community in monthly meetings, our annual fundraiser, the 
Fun Run and community family events. The school garden is tended by students, teachers, and 
parent volunteers working closely with staff.

All programs in the Site Plan are based on stat
e content and performance standards. Goals are established annually and made explicit in 
the objectives and activities in each section of the plan. These goals are supported by professional development at site and 
district 
meetings, staff development days,
 
and conferences. The plan supports learning for all students school
-
wide with additional funding and 
services provided for special education and English Language Learners. 
 
 
MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The Hidden Valley mission is to provide 
comprehensive learning experiences based on best practices:
 

 
where students will develop confidence in their ability to think for themselves, analyze a variety of situations, find creati
ve 
solutions, and generate a love of learning, and;
 

 
where students will
 
approach the world beyond their immediate community with a sense of respect, wonder and 
responsibility;
 

 
where students will be challenged to reach their highest learning potential within a rigorous academic context enriched by ar
t 
instruction.
 
We prepare 
our students to be self
-
motivated, knowledgeable, and caring life
-
long learners! 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

materials; recommendations are then made to the board of trustees for approval. During the 2019
-
20 school year, the district is piloting science 
curriculum materials
 
for adoption. During the 2018
-
29 school year, the district adopted TCI History Alive! as our middle school history/social science 
curriculum. The below table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Ross Valley School District passed a $41 million facility bond in November 2010 to accommodate increased enrollment and r
eplacement and/or 
repairs at Hidden Valley School and other schools in the district. In sum
mer of 2016, 3 modular classrooms were added to replace the two portables.   
New playground and basketball courts were added.
 
 
Ross Valley School District uses Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies and the least toxic method of pest control possi
ble 
as a means to control 
unwanted pests. In accordance with AR 3514.2 IPM strategy focuses on long
-
term prevention or suppression of pest problems through a combination of 
techniques such as monitoring for pest presence and establishing treatment threshold le
vels, using non
-
chemical practices to make the habitat less 
conducive to pest development, improving sanitation, and employing mechanical and physical controls. Pesticides that pose the
 
least possible hazard 
and are effective in a manner that minimizes ris
ks to people, property, and the environment are used only after careful monitoring indicates they are 
needed according to established guidelines and treatment thresholds. ( California Education Code §17609; Food and Agricultura
l Code§ 13181)

and offer their many talents and expertise to enrich the educational experience of our students. We invite and encourage pare
nts to take an active role 
in their child's education and the school commu
nity.  There are a variety of leadership opportunities for parents at the school level, such as school site 
council and the parent club.  It is our site's goal this year to take a closer look at Equity and how we can be a more inclus
ive school community.
