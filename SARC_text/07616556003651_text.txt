Description
 
 
Message From Principal
 
Dear Families and Community:
 
Edna Hill Middle School has been selected by the California Department of Education as one of 

our efforts to meet the needs of adolescent students.
 
 
Edna Hill School began its journey as a 6th 

 
8th grade middle school in 2003
-
2004. Our exceptional 
and committed staff wanted to design the best programs possible for students. Recent and 
emerging res
earch confirmed that close relationships with teachers were critical to academic 
success for students in the middle grades. To that end, we set out to create a student
-
centered 
learning environment that responded to the intellectual, social, and psychologi
cal needs of young 
adolescents.
 
 
Edna Hill Middle School has shown dramatic academic gains on state testing.  Our efforts to align 
instructional programs with the rigors of state standards began to reveal its impact on student 

uit of continuous improvement regarding their own professional 

department, teachers learned from each other through peer observations, collegial dialogue, and 
rese
arch
-
based strategies that work for kids. We are continuing to work on our upward trajectory 
as we implement the California State Standards.
 
 
As a result of our efforts to meet the needs of all students, we have been selected as a California 
and National S
chools To Watch 

 
Taking Center Stage model school. We recognize this honor as an 
opportunity to develop relationships with other schools and to continue championing student 

-
de

Schools To Watch Model School in 2010, 2013, 2016 and 2019. We are exceptionally proud of our 
entire school community, and the school district that supports our efforts.

District Mission Statement
 
The Brentwood Union School District will provide an exemplary education to all children in a safe, student
-
centered environment designed 
to nurture the whole 
child and partner with families to prepare globally productive citizens.
 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Account
ability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and
 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Avai
lability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Brentwood Union Elementary held a public hearing on Sept. 11, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had s
ufficient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materia
ls, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for 
use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for us
e by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to ad
option. The table displays information collected in Sept. 11, 2019 about the quality, 
currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter

ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of the Brentwood Union School District.  The district and schools are in co
mpliance with all laws, rules, 
and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The School Site Sa
fety plan was last reviewed and updated 3/1/2019 
by the School Safety Committee. All revisions were communicated to the both the classified and certificated staff.  The schoo

plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safet
y during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school 
year.  Lockdown and Lockout drills are held twice a year. Students are supervised before and after school and during lunch by
 
certificated and classified 
s
taff and the principal. Parent volunteers help with supervision during lunch and break periods. There is a designated area fo
r student drop off and pick 
up. All visitors are required to check in at the office upon arrival and before departing from the scho
ol campus.  Visitor badges are issued at the time of 
check
-
in and are to be worn throughout the visit.  All visitors are scanned by our Raptor Visitor system.
