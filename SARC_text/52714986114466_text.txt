School Description
 
Located in the
 
agricultural center of Tehama County in the northern Sacramento Valley, Columbia 
has become a showplace of alternative education. Our school offers rigorous curriculum designed 
to meet state standards, in a setting designed to engage and motivate students
. From our computer 
lab to materials to engaging staff, student learning and sense of belonging are paramount 
outcomes. Additionally, we offer many programs specifically designed for our school and 
community. On site, we host various local and county couns
eling groups, an AB 1801 Counselor, 
Study Skills classes, and educational field trips.
 
 
Our facilities also offer out students different outlets for creativity and growth. They have full use 
of an athletic field and two basketball courts. We pride ourselve
s on our ability to serve the needs 
of our students, staff, and community.
 
 
The Columbia Mission: Each student will be successfully taught grade level work every day in the 
safest environment possible.
 
 
Our goals are to ensure that each student is able to 
access the highest quality curriculum across the 
content areas, receives research
-
based instruction utilizing results
-
proven instructional 
methodologies, SDAIE strategies, and differentiation, and has opportunities for remediation and/or 
tutoring. We also 
strive to ensure that all students take the most rigorous classes that they are able 
to take to prepare them for high school, their yearly state assessments, and for the California High 
School Exit Examination.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
Columbia currently 
provides students with a variety of services. We maintain RSP services and 
academic counseling through AB 1802.

DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq

that contains additional information about this school and 
comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic 
system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, h
igh school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., 
the California State Library). Acc
ess to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally 
provided on a first

served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of 
operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the t

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of ea
ch year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula 
(LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local pr
iorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parent
s/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority
 
4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 
The school safety plan for Columbia is on file at the District Office, at the Corning Police Department, and in the Maywood M
iddle School office. This plan 
identifies the appropriate strategies 
and programs to provide and maintain a high level of school safety. The plan addresses, in detail, the following items: 
current status of school crime, child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of suspensions and/or expulsions, sexu
al harassme
nt policies, dress 
codes, and general school safety. The school safety plan was last reviewed and updated in November of 2019 and last discussed
 
with school faculty that 
same month.
 
 
Additionally, all students were provided copies of the disciplinary matri
x, including reasons for suspensions and expulsions. The matrix details 
consequences for similar infractions of the Education Code and consequences for dissimilar infractions of the Education Code 
and school rules.
