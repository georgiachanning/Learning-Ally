About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Rosemead School District sets a high priority on making 
high quality textbooks and materials available to support instructional programs. Rosemead 
School District held a public hearing and determined that textbooks, instructional materials, and science lab equipment were 
sufficient and of good 
quality at each s
chool within the district, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including Englis
h learners, are 
given their own  standards
-
aligned textbooks and instructional materials in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and at home. All textbooks and 
instructional materials are aligned with the California State Content Standards and Frameworks and have been approved by the 
Board of Trustees. 
Rosemead School District follows the State Instructional Materials Adoption Cycle
 
that reviews instructional materials in each curricular area within a six
-
year cycle. The chart below illustrates the textbooks currently in use at our school.All textbooks are in adequate supply and
 
fair to excellent condition. 
100% of students in each c
ore subject area possess the necessary textbooks and instructional materials.  Additional supplemental materials utilized to 
support students are iReady, Simple Solutions, RAZ
-
KIDZ, Stemscopes, and Mystery Science.
 
 

y books for students to check out, including books and materials in Spanish. Students visit the library on a weekly 
basis with their classes.  The school also has a comprehensive leveled library of books for guided reading and English Langua
ge Development.
  
Computers 
at the school are connected to the internet via a high speed connection so that students are able to access resources and inf
ormation on
-
line and develop 
their research skills. The school is working to integrate computer skills and concepts acr
oss the curriculum. Students in grades kindergarten through six 
receive computer
-
assisted instruction on a weekly basis in our state
-
of
-
the
-
art computer lab. Every classroom is equipped with 1

of a major electrical 
upgrade was completed 
in September 2007.  A branding project to improve the exterior and hallways of the school was completed in the summer of 
2010.  All classroom doors were painted and given a modern painted number to give all classroom doors a more modern look.  Ba
nners, str
eet signs and 
hallway signs were installed throughout the hallways along with a new school logo.  In the 2011
-
12 school year, all classrooms were modernized to meet 
the 21st century setting.  All classrooms had a pole vault/projector installed, 120 in. scr
eens, voice lifts, tackable walls, new sinks, furniture, whiteboards 
and speakers.  All classrooms also had the interior painted, and some classes had new carpet installed.  The facility strongl

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

Note: Mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative 

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students w
ho met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is
 
too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that w
as used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using only students 
who received scores.

School Safety Plan
 
Janson School is a closed campus. During school hours, the 
entrance is secured to ensure visitors check in with the front office. All visitors are required 
to sign in and to wear visitor badges during their stay. While visits by parents and community members are welcomed, anyone w
ishing to be on campus 
during scho
ol hours should notify the staff ahead of time. During lunch, breaks, and before and after school, yard supervisors and teach
ers supervise 
students and monitor the campus, including the cafeteria and playgrounds, to ensure a safe and orderly environment.
 
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the district to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The plan pr
ovides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. The school safety plan includes the followin
g requirements of SB 187: current status of 
school crime; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine, and emergency; policies related to suspension a
nd expulsion; notification 
to teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and school employees; safe and 
orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures. The school evaluates the plan annually and updates it as needed.
 
The plan was last updated 
in January 
of  2020 and reviewed with school staff in January 2020. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Plan, are r
eviewed with 
school and district staff throughout the school year during various safety training opportunities and emergency drills
.
