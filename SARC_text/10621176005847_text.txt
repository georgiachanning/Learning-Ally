About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report
 
Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountabilit
y Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Cole Elementary was originally built in 1958 and has been very fortunate to have completed multiple remodeling projects. Duri
ng the summer of 2015, 
Cole under
-
went a complete remodel. Each classroom was completely re
done, the kitchen was remodeled for better efficiency, the library and computer 
lab were completely restructured, and the main office was expanded and improved. During the summer of 2019 the Multi
-
Purpose Room was completely 
remodeled and updated.  An amph
itheater was added on the north side of campus to provide opportunities for outdoor assemblies and rallies.  We 
provide a clean, safe environment for learning. Our custodial staff consists of one daytime lead custodian and two evening cu
stodians who perfor
m basic 
cleaning operations daily and maintain the grounds and buildings. We also have a grounds com
-
missioner as part of our student council.
 
 
In addition, we conduct deep cleaning two times a year at each site. Our SART committee conducts eight clean
-
cam
pus inspections each year. This 
committee of community members inspects the campus grounds and restrooms on a regular basis to provide feedback. When we aske
d parents to grade 
how well the buildings and grounds are maintained at Cole, over 90% rated the gr
ounds as good to excellent. Removing graffiti is a top priority, thus, we 
remove it immediately. We strive to improve student responsibility and community support in keeping our campus safe and clean
.
 
 
Through increased community awareness, school pride, a
nd an open campus policy, we hope to keep vandalism and burglary to an all
-
time low. Teachers, 
campus monitors and parent volunteers are on duty whenever students are outside the classroom in an effort to maintain studen
t safety at all times.
 
 
The school f
eatures well maintained athletic fields used for multiple sports encompassing all seasons; a large newly remodeled multipurpo
se room used 
as a lunchroom and for performing arts, wrestling and assemblies; and a Library Media Center (LMC), which is managed b
y a library media technician 
and houses a computer lab managed by a technology teacher with internet access and thousands of books; and 35 classrooms.
 
 
Philosophically, the district believes that schools are the hub of their neighborhoods. As a result, we 
place a high priority on building and maintaining 
excellent facilities as economically as possible.
 
 
Recent improvements include the installation of new carpet throughout the classrooms and office, the addition of two outdoor 
retaining walls and several 
co
ncrete walkways, the replacement of windows in many classrooms, upgraded restrooms, landscaping improvements, and several min
or projects 
improving the aesthetics of the campus. Attention is focused annually on the drop
-
off and pick
-
up zone, where improveme
nts are continuously being 
made to improve safety. We just completed our snack
-
bar remodel.

Cole enjoys the benefits of a very 
supportive community and provides a variety of options for parents who want to be involved. Since 1973, CUSD has 
benefited from the formation of a parent advisory group known as the School Assessment Review Team (SART). SART committees me

basis and provide a forum for school personnel and interested parents to meet and discuss items related to the effectiveness 

Parents may also become involved at school by joining the Cole Foundation, a very active group that orga
nizes activities and fundraisers for the school. 
In addition, parents may volunteer in the classroom or as crossing guards; serve on various committees, such as the School Si
te Council (SSC), English 
Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) or Intercultural Diver

Many factors determined staff
-
development needs during the 
2017
-
18 year, including teacher needs, assessment, and formal and informal discussions 
between faculty and the administration. Areas of priority included the following:
 

 
Strategies for improving student achievement in math
 

 
Strategies for improving student a
chievement in reading comprehension, including utilizing social science and science text for reading 
instruction
 

 
Closing the achievement gap with our Focus Group Students
 

 
Developing the Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) program to rewar
d positive behaviors
 
 
Teachers: Professional
-
growth time for teachers is provided each week on early
-
release Wednesdays. During this time, teachers share best practices and 
strategies; review student performance data to inform instruction, intervention and
 
reteaching; and provide information gleaned from conferences.
 
 
Teachers are aware of school and district funds that provide for substitutes so that staff may observe other exemplary teache
rs, meet in grade
-
level 
articulation sessions or attend conferences
 
that focus on student achievement.
 
 
Teachers, upon their return from these conferences, share valuable information with their colleagues. The district also provi
des professional growth 
opportunities that offer demonstration school forums and educational s
eminars. New teachers to the profession or grade level receive further support 
through the many workshops of the Beginning Teacher Sup
-
port and Assessment (BTSA) program and through their association with individual support 
providers.
 
 
Cole places strong e
mphasis on professional growth and provides many formal and informal avenues for teachers to continue their development.
 
 
Paraprofessionals and other school personnel: Cole believes that paraprofessionals and other school personnel make a strong a
nd valuab
le impact on 
students and their efforts toward educational excellence. All personnel are made aware of the availability of school and dist
rict staff development and 
training funds. Personnel are invited to attend meet
-
ngs in which school resources are bein
g allocated, participate in forums on current educational 
topics, attend school commit
-
tees and be involved in the planning of the yearly program.
 
 
Volunteers: Cole utilizes many members of the community to enhance support to its students and 
strengthen the ties within the entire community. 
Training for volunteers is provided at the district or site level. Volunteer members participate in many capacities, includin
g the high school physical
-
education tutorial program, crossing guards, parent cla
ssroom volunteers, SSC and SART.
 
 
The district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs: first time best instruction, maste
ry learning, multi
-
tiered system 
of supports, implementation of the California Content Standards 
and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018
-
19 school year, 
the district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff. Teachers were offered professional developm
ent opportunities on staff 
development days, s
ubstitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after
-
school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.
 
One hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty
-
five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and cl
assroom coaching 
through the CUSD Induction program. In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site
-
based training and district sponsored training that included: 
curriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi
-
tier
ed systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.

Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community.  CU
SD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive differences in the lives of the child

education will not only bring success to your child but other children in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in
 
the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud
 
to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending on the type of categorica
l 
funding a site may receive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and gui
del
ines.  Such advisory 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee (DAC) and School Advisory Committee (SAC)
 

 
District Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC)

School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) describes the school

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each and every student.  Parental involvement is a nece
ssary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall p

Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP).  If you would like additional information on any of the District Parent Councils or Commi
ttees, please ca

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical
 
programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
ts, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing an
d evaluating the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.
 
 
District Advisory Committee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves
 
as an 
advisory committee 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs
 
are supplemental education opportunities that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  The SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to functio
n as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are required to form an ELAC. T
he ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes 
recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding services for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two years.

District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the d
istrict, there shall be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a DELAC representative and arra
nge to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC byl
aws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/guardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) e
lected to serve as the DELAC 
representative by the sit

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meets four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achieve
ment of our students, community agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan Native students in grades

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP annually that works to better align the academic plan
 
with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our 
CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participation of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, D
istrict Meetings and 
Communi
ty Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share their i
deas on how CUSD 
can provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in

provide input
 
and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to share new ideas t

The following is an overview of the categorical f

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 

 
characteristics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economically disadvantaged ho
mes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they
 
have a primary language other than English.  Children, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally provided through the base/core curriculum program.
  
The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental s
ervices and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Categorical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support to meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of hig
h quality learning opportunities and access to the core curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additional assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom pro
gram (base/core curriculum) 
and address any le
arning gaps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff development.   Staff 
development 
activities are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other sta
ff to challenge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
