how
 
they
 
intend
 
to

for
 
all
 
pupils,

School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
Riverbank
 
strives
 
to
 
promote
 
a
 
positive
 
learning
 
environment
 
where
 
students
 
feel
 
safe.
 
To
 
maintain
 
a
 
safe
 
environment,
 
we
 
discuss
 
our
 
school™s
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
at
 
the
 
Back
 
to
 
School
 
meeting
 
each
 
year.
 
New
 
evacuation
 
signs
 
and
 
routes
 
are
 
shared
 
with
 
staff
 
and
 
are
 
posted
 
in
 
the
 
classrooms
 
and
 
other
 
common
 
areas
 
and
 
an
 
Emergency
 
Response
 
Plan
 
is
 
located
 
in
 
the
 
office.
 
A
 
BEST
 
(building
 
effective
 
schools
 
together)/PBIS
 
team
 
and
 
safety
 
committee
 
were
 
formed
 
to
 
review
 
discipline
 
data,
 
review
 
safety
 
issues
 
on
 
the
 
site,
 
and
 
plan
 
social
 
skills
 
lessons.
 
The
 
team
 
meets
 
once
 
a
 
month
 
to
 
discuss
 
and
 
plan
 
and
 
communicates
 
with
 
staff.
 
The
 
entire
 
staff
 
focuses
 
on
 
three
 
rules,
 
be
 
safe,
 
be
 
respectful
 
and
 
be
 
responsible.
 
Riverbank
 
focuses
 
on
 
PRIDE
 
(Positive
 
Attitude,
 
Responsibility,
 
Integrity,
 
Determination,
 
and
 
Empathy)
 
on
 
a
 
weekly
 
basis.
 
Students
 
receive
 
quotes
 
and
 
examples
 
during
 
daily
 
messages
 
to
 
remind
 
students
 
how
 
to
 
have
 
Otter
 
Pride
 
and
 
be
 
safe,
 
respectful,
 
and
 
responsible
 
on
 
and
 
off
 
campus.
 
Our
 
safety
 
committee
 
meets
 
monthly
 
and
 
communication
 
is
 
shared
 
with
 
staff
 
and
 
parents.
 
We
 
also
 
have
 
regularly
 
scheduled
 
drills
 
(monthly
 
fire
 
drill,
 
earthquake
 
drill,
 
and
 
lock
 
down
 
drills)
 
to
 
remind
 
students
 
what
 
steps
 
they
 
should
 
take
 
to
 
be
 
safe.
