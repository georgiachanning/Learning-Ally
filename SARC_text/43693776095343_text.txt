By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We, the Majestic Way staff and community, believe that all
 
students can expect a safe, secure, caring and consistent 
learning environment which will challenge them to reach their maximum potential. Experience in our school community 
will foster their self

worth and ability to respect and relate well with diverse 
experiences and communities. Our ultimate 
goal is for all students to become independent critical thinkers, life long learners and to become positive contributors to 
society.
 
 
Majestic Way offers an academically and culturally rich experience which is a di
rect result of the partnership between 
families, school staff, and the community. I look forward to working with the families and school staff to provide the best 
possible educational program for our students.
 
 
My greatest wish for students is that each re
ceives the best educational experience possible. Together, we can cultivate 
well
-
rounded, compassionate, and productive life
-
long learners.
 
 
Majestic Way is truly a magnificent school. I am excited for a wonderful and successful school year.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General: The district places
 
a strong emphasis on ensuring that all schools are safe, clean, environmentally friendly, 
mechanically functional and inviting for students, staff members, and the community. To assist in this effort, the district 
utilizes Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) d
eveloped by the State of California OPSC and local operations department developed 
inspection survey methods to keep facilities in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. The 
district regularly inspects and reviews the conditio
n of the school facilities and surrounding grounds. The district places 
the highest priority on those safeguards that impact the fire, life and safety protection of the students, staff, and school 
buildings. Below is more specific information on the condit
ion of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students 
are provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School Buildings: Majestic Way was opened in 1975. This school has 22 regular classrooms, a 
multipurpose room, 
a library, and an administration building. In addition to the main building, there are seven portable classrooms that have 
been added to accommodate class size reduction and instructional programs for the Santa Clara County Office of 
Edu
cation.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order system process is used to ensure efficient service and 
highest
 

in good working order. This site is also had interior and exterior lighting upgrades completed through Prop. 39 initiatives 
in identified are
as throughout the campus.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule: The district has developed cleaning standards and schedules for all schools in the district. 
A summary of these standards and schedules is available at the school or the Maintenance & Operations off
ice. The 
principal, with the guidance of the maintenance supervisor works daily with the custodial team to ensure that the cleaning 
standards are met, and that classrooms, restrooms, and campus grounds are kept clean, safe, and well
-
maintained.

We invite parents to 
participate on our School Site Council, which has been combined with our ELAC parents, which 
approves our plan for improving student achievement, addresses the needs of our English learners, and oversees the 
school budget. Parents are highly encouraged to 
be involved in the activities of our PTA. Parents regularly volunteer in the 
classroom and are actively encouraged to chaperone fields trips and participate in grade level activities such as the end of 
the year BBQ, the talent show, music concerts, Charact
er Counts assemblies, the Harvest festival, Multi Cultural 
Celebration and the Majestic Way Olympics. Parents are invited to our Curriculum Night in the fall to hear teachers talk 
about the subject matter that they will be teaching and to raise any questio
ns they have. We also host an annual spring 
Open House so students can display their work for parents where we highlight our science fair. Finally, they are 
encouraged to help lead our participation in Read across America and we cap the year with our Volun
teer Recognition 
Dinner.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school safety committee updates our school 
safety plan each year in September and October. Every classroom has 
access to emergency supplies, and we conduct monthly safety drills. Teachers supervise outside before school and after 
school and during breaks, during which they monitor student crossing 
guards at each cross site before and after school, 
with a final sweep of the campus after school. We have developed an Emergency Drill training packet for use during drills, 
and we perform disaster simulations to keep our readiness skills and training curr
ent. We keep parents and students 
informed about safety issues in the school newsletter and through assemblies on topics regarding character building, as 
well as the Random Acts of Kindness Week and a bullying assembly. To continue to address the safety of
 
the school 
behaviorally, we have begun a boys club and girls club for 5th grade with our school social worker and PBIS program with 
the Mix It Up days that is implemented school
-
wide.

school sit e to identify the students who need extra support based upon district benchmarks or teacher recommendations. 
Each school site selects certificated and classified staff to teach these SI classes, usually after school (1 

 
3 days a week). 
Each sch

Professional Development this school year occurred on many different levels 

 
before school started (summer of 2019) 
and ongoing throughout the 2019 

 
2020 
school year.  The district office working with our site principals and curriculum 
leadership teams developed the scope/sequence of the professional development.  Leadership teams reviewed student 
data produced from benchmark tests, ELPAC, and SBAC data, as
 
well as staff feedback when developing the scope and 
sequence.
 
 
At the beginning of the school year, all certificated and classified staff participated in two days of professional 
development aligned to their instructional role and needs.  TK
-
5 teachers r
eceived training on providing effective Tier 1 
instruction in math and ELA.  Special education staff, social workers and psychologists received training on topics pertinent
 
to their needs such as All Learning is Social Emotional, TCI De
-
Escalation, Instruc
tional Scaffolding to Assist and Support 
Student , and Data Collection and Behavior Management.  Middle school staff received specialized training related to the 
content they teach, that focused on the social emotional element of learning as well as recent
ly adopted curriculum.  All 
middle school teachers participated in a workshop on understanding gender.  Training for new teachers focused on 

h their 
certificated colleagues in order to have the opportunity to collaborate while learning.  They also attended other sessions 
designed to meet their specific professional needs.
 
 
During the school year middle school, science teachers were 
released up to three days to collaborate on implementation 
of the new science program.  Middle school math and writing teachers scored and/or analyze student benchmarks during 
release days for each grade.  7th grade science teachers were released for 1

comprehensive sexuality program.  Additional training was offered on release day for special education teachers to 
support implementation of our dyslexia curriculum as well as special education components of our ELA progr
ams.

Throughout the school year, we offered monthly professional development sessions in which all teachers participated (1.5 
hours on 10 early release Thursday afternoons).  Principals and district office administrators chose the topics for the 2019
-
2020
 
school year in alignment with the District focus on developing a multi
-
tiered system of support.
 
 
The Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL) program was implemented at six of our ten elementary schools in grades TK
-
3.  The schools included were Cherrywood
, Laneview, Summerdale, Brooktree, Toyon and Vinci Park.   Teachers in the first 
two years of implementation received three two
-
day training modules each followed by a day of unit planning.  Teachers 
in the third and fourth year of implementation participa
ted in three days of unit planning.  Contracted SEAL experts 
provided the module training sessions and three district instructional coaches facilitated the follow up planning PD 
sessions.  Teachers were released from their classrooms for all of these PD da
ys.
 
 
Four instructional coaches provided BTSA induction training for all teachers who qualified to receive BTSA training and 
support. Additionally, BUSD teachers provide PAR assistance to teachers who are in need of additional assistance.  All 
teachers hav
e access to an instructional coach so that they can receive follow up support on implementing new learning 
attended through professional development.
 
 
An MTSS committee and Differentiated Assistance Team received 3
-
5 days of training on change management f
acilitated 
by WestEd and the Santa Clara County Office of Education.  Some members also participated in 3 training sessions of 
equity.  Team members then trained principals during monthly professional development meetings.   The focus of both 
teams aligned
 
with the district goal of developing multi
-
tiered systems of support at each site.
