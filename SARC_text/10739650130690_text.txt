About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

School Safety Plan
 
The Site Emergency Response Plan (Scho
ol Safety Plan) was developed and then approved in cooperation with state, county, city, and district civil 
emergency response staff by the School Site Council on October 11, 2019. The Site Emergency Response Plan was reviewed with t
he staff on August 12, 
2019.  At that time each staff member was given copies of the Emergency Management Organization Chart with a description of t
he specific roles and 
responsibilities for each position.The plan is to ensure that all students and staff are safe while on the ca
mpus of  Tilley Elementary. Fire Drills are practiced 
monthly and Lock Down drills are practiced each semester.  By January 22, 2020, the Tilley staff will have been trained by th
e Fresno Police Department 
with their "Run, Hide, Fight training".   The majo
r objectives of emergency response procedures are to save lives and protect property in the event of a 
disaster.  Staff has been provided with two way radios and surveillance cameras have been installed at the site.

Tilley teachers in their first or second year of teaching are actively participating in the 
Beginning Teacher Induction program and have a mentor who 
meets regularly with the teacher. Induction program teachers are given the opportunity to observe exemplary teachers in the D
istrict as well as receive 
district training and attend professional work
shops and seminars.
 
 
Professional development is an on
-
going process at Tilley; both for administrators and teachers.  To create a culture where all students are actively 
engaged in their learning, most teachers have participated in Kagan Training. Several
 
teachers also attended The Daily 5 training to learn specific 
classroom management strategies to be used during small group instruction.  To continue to create and maintain a rigorous lea
rning environment, some 
of our teachers attended a Cognitive Guided 
Instruction training to increase the rigor, all while reasoning in mathematics.
 
 
Every other week, teachers participate in staff development after school. Professional learning content is designed based on 
reflective data analysis to 
determine the academic
, behavioral, and social
-
emotional needs of students. Professional learning is delivered on
-
site and at the District Office by site 
administration, District Instructional Support Coaches, District Office support staff, and other educational professionals. 
Teachers are supported in 
training to practice by site administrators and District Instructional Support Coaches. Site administrators conduct weekly in
formal drop
-
in observations 
and provide constructive feedback. District Instructional Support Coaches, al
ong with site administration, provide demonstration lessons, co
-
planning/co
-
teaching of lessons, and targeted support based on need. Grade level teacher Professional Learning Communities (PLC's) meet a
t least twice weekly to 
analyze student learning, discu
ss specific literacy supports for students, and adjust classroom instruction.
 
 
The professional learning focus this year includes the following: Effective instructional planning and best teaching practice
s to implement integrated and 
designated English Lan
guage Development (ELD),  providing quality guided reading and/or small group instruction in all classrooms, utilizing runnin
g 
records and other forms of assessment for progress monitoring, and strategies for intentional silent reading. Ongoing support
 
and
 
learning for how to 
address the social
-
emotional needs of students will continue as well.
