By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and communit
y members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and 
other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation
, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
King Avenue School serves Preschool through 5th grade students in the Yuba City Unified School District. We strive to 
provide a comprehensive educational experience for every student with an ongoing goal that all students will be proficient 
in E
nglish Language Arts and Math and have the social skills to function productively in society. Students are supervised 
by teachers, administrators, and yard duty personnel at all times.  There is a designated drop off and pick up areas at the 
front of the s
chool.  All visitors must sign in at the office, where they receive a badge that must be displayed at all times.  
Our playgrounds are large with separate Kindergarten and Preschool areas as well as two play structures for 1st through 
5th grade students.  T
here are basketball and blacktop game areas and a large grassy field area for play and physical 
education instruction.  Our track and baseball infields were resurfaced during the summer of 2014.  All students eat lunch 
in the cafeteria/multipurpose room.  
It is also used for our assemblies, other large gatherings, as well as our after school 
program, King Avenue Beyond the Bell.  This program serves 120 of our students daily until 6:00 p.m.  King Avenue School 
participates in the Community Eligibility Provi
sion (CEP). This allows 100% of our students receive free breakfast and lunch.  
A supper program for those students who stay in the after school program is also available to our students.
 
 
Our long term goals are for all students to love learning and to 
inspire their desire to become lifelong learners. We are 
proud of our well trained and caring staff who work collaboratively with each other, parents, and community to meet all 
students' diverse needs. Students at King Avenue School are served by a variety
 
of support programs and personnel.  We 
have a comprehensive Response to Intervention (RtI) program that includes academic and behavioral interventions.  Our 
intervention teacher, school counselor, special education staff, and instructional coach work regu
larly with administration 
to offer interventions that are individually tailored to the needs of each student.  King Avenue also uses Read 180, System 
44, Redbird and one
-
to
-
one aides to address students' academic needs.  We closely monitor the progress to 
support the 
continued needs of each student.
 
 
King Avenue School staff believes in three important core values.  These beliefs drive our actions and the decisions that 
we make every day.  They are as follows:
 
o Energy Prioritization 

 
Energy is invested on
ly in those things within our control and proven to advance the goals.
 
o Purposeful and factual instructional program decision making 

 
A clear link exists between teacher behaviors and 
student achievement.
 
o Long term commitment and focus on established p
riorities 

 
To give students the opportunities they deserve, there is a 
commitment across the school to consistently focus on our goals.

The bark in the playground equipment area is replenished yearly prior to the beginning of the school year.   The planned 
improvements for the 2018
-
2019 school year have been completed.  The outdoor 
lights in the hallways have been replaced 
with new LED lighting.  A camera and monitor have been installed in the front office to improve safety by providing visual 
access to the front entrance.  The main wall ball court has been expanded by removing a tre
e and adding more cement to 
provide more space needed to play the game.  The running track has been resurfaced by adding more gravel and leveled 
to eliminate pot holes.  Two basketball hoops have been lowered so that students in the younger grades can play
 
basketball while also maintaining one other court for the upper grade students.  A crown has been painted on the court 
to implement the Royal Court Recognitions weekly.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced 
Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may
 
participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of 
students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The King Avenue Elementary School staff believes that parent involvement is an important element in each child's 
education and necessary for students to succeed in school. Parents are always welc
ome and are highly encouraged by 
staff to be directly involved in all aspects of our school efforts.  Parents may volunteer in classrooms and/or about the 
school. We are grateful for parent volunteers as they make a difference at King Ave School.  Parents 
actively participate 
on our School Site Council and our district and site level English Learner Advisory Committees (DELAC/ELAC).
 
 
Parents are encouraged to join our newly established King Avenue Parent Teacher Association (KAPTA) to help plan and 
facilita
te academic enrichment activities for our students. KAPTA is responsible for helping with our VIP Day, Red Ribbon 
Week, staff appreciation, assemblies, t
-

held on the third Thursday
 
of every month and are open to all parents.  King Avenue prides itself in providing parents with 
a Family Resource Center and a full
-
time Parent Liasion.  The Family Center provides a variety of parent education 
resources and services that include parenti
ng classes, referral to community services, parenting tools and supports, as 
well as English instruction for parents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The King Avenue's Safety Plan is reviewed annually at the beginning of the school year and ongoing throughout the school 
year. The focus of the reviews stresses the procedures for ensuring student safety during a 
variety of emergencies. The 
school is in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake 
standards. The school's disaster preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during 
a disaster. 
Fire, earthquake, and intruder drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year.  This is the second school
 
year that the Incident Command System has been implemented in our safety procedures. The safety plan was reviewed 
and 
updated on August 5, 2019 and discussed with school faculty on August 9, 2019.

King Avenue Elementary School and the District makes safety for students, staff, and volunteers a number one priority.  
For this reason, King Avenue has been implementing the P
ositive Behavioral  Interventions and Supports (BPIS) system. 
PBIS focuses on teaching behavioral expectations and reinforcing them through positive praise.  Students are supervised 
by teachers and administrators before and after school. During lunch and r
ecess, yard duty personnel, teachers and 
administrators supervise students. Crossing guards assist with supervision before and after school. There is a newly 
designed and remodeled student drop off and pickup area at the main entrance of the school. All vi
sitors must sign in at 
the office, where they receive a badge that must be displayed at all times. All non
-
enrolled students are accompanied by 
their parents or responsible adults. King Avenue students know that their school strives to be a safe place for 
every child 
to learn.
