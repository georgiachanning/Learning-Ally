School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Morningside was built in 2000. The school has 32 classrooms (16 permanent and 16 portable), a Special Education 
classrooms, a multi
-
purpose facility, a library/resource building, and an administration building. Additional portable 
classrooms were added in 
2001. The staff lounge provides adequate space for staff activities as well as place for lunch. 
Our playground provides plenty of space that includes four basketball courts, four square courts, tetherball, two softball 
fields, volleyball/tennis court, swin
gs, and play gym. The Kindergarten play area includes a play gym, swings, and a large 
grassy area.
 
 
The District takes great efforts to ensure schools are clean, safe, and functional. Our District Maintenance, Operations, 
and Transportation Department (MOT
) works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean 
and safe school. District maintenance oversees repairs necessary to keep the school in good working order.
 
 
The school is wired for multimedia and has 
surveillance cameras. A digital Marquee was installed in the Fall of 2006 and 
updated at the begging of the 2017 academic year.  The marquee is an important method of communication to parents in 
cases of communicating emergencies or daily messages. The lig
hting, heating, cooling, and alarm system are in good 
working order.  A representative from MOT and site administration conduct a walk
-
through twice per year, checking for 
needed repairs and safety conditions. After this report is published, immediate corr

safety representative attends regular Injury & Illness Prevention Program (IIPP) meetings. Our students help with litter 
control and are taught to respect their school.
 
 
The district participates in the State School Deferre
d Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a 
dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school 
building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heatin
g, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or 
exterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
Supervision is provided 30 minutes before school and during the lunch recess. Morning recesses and dismissal times are 
supervised by certificated staff. All certifi
cated staff members are assigned duties for the year.
 
 
All visitors must enter the office through the front gate of the campus, sign in and check into the Raptor System before 
they are provided a pass.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Morningside 
provides many opportunities for parent involvement. Constant communication between the home and 
school is supported by student planners, teacher newsletters/notes, phone communication program name Blackboard, 
school marquee, and a monthly school calendar. 
Parents are always welcome to visit Morningside School's classrooms or 
volunteer for activities or events. We have a very active ASB group which meets monthly to plan special activities for 
students, parents, and teachers. Parents and the community are vie
wed as essential partners in providing support for the 
academic success of all students.  Activities that parents enjoy attending are as follows: Kindergarten Orientation, 
Parent/Teacher Conferences, Lunch with your Child, Grandparent "cafe/milk con pan du
lce", Mariner of the Month 
Assemblies, Book Fair, Parent Education events, Fall Carnival, movie nights, craft fair, classroom volunteers, and serve as 
field trip chaperones. Parents are also elected by peers to serve on our School Site Council and English 
Learner Advisory 
Council. Parents participate in the intervention meetings (SAT) and I.E.P. meetings as well as individual parent conferences

Students with special needs are provided differentiated instruction and support through a pull
-
in or pull
-
out program. The 
Students Assistance Team (SAT) meets on a regular basis to address interventions, modifications, and parent involvement 
in meeting th
e individual needs of all students. The SAT targets academic, attendance, and the behavioral needs of 
students.
 
 
Universal Access and the Language Block are two supplemental programs used to support our English Language Arts 
Program. In Universal Access (U
A), students receive re
-
teach or enrichment instruction based on the grade level literacy 
focus standards. The Language Development Block is used to group students based on their CELDT (California English 
Language Development Test) and ADEPT (A Development
 

language level.  After School Intervention provides students with additional opportunities to learn necessary skills to be 
successful in school.
 
 
Core and supplementary curriculum is carefully s
elected to support special needs of all students. Supplementary programs 
include Orchard (a computer program supporting primary grade level English Language Arts and mathematics standards), 
and Accelerated Reader. Students in grades 4 and 5 who are reading
 
two grade levels below their current grade, 
participate in a pull out intervention program.
 
 
Students identified with additional special needs are served by a special education teacher and/or a speech pathologist.
