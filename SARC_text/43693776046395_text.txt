By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Built in 1959, Piedmont Middle School is the oldest middle school 
in Berryessa Union School District. Piedmont has a long
-
standing tradition of preparing students for a successful high school experience. Staff members are highly committed to 
the overall well being and success of our students. During the summer of 2017, P
iedmont Middle school underwent a 
modernization project that updated all the classrooms and common areas. A new Flexible Instruction Space is currently 
under construction and is scheduled to be opened in November 2018.
 
 
Piedmont Middle School is comprised 
of a diverse student body of students in grades 6, 7, and 8. The ethnic breakdown 
of students at Piedmont is 38% Asian, 35% Latino, 14% Filipino, 5% White, 3% African American, and 5% of Two or More 
Races. As a Title I school, Piedmont Middle School has 45
% socio

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
PIEDMONT
 
General: The district places a strong 
emphasis on ensuring that all schools are safe, clean, environmentally friendly, 
mechanically functional and inviting for students, staff members, and the community. To assist in this effort, the district 
utilizes Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed b
y the State of California OPSC and local operations department developed 
inspection survey methods to keep facilities in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. The 
district regularly inspects and reviews the condition of the s
chool facilities and surrounding grounds. The district places 
the highest priority on those safeguards that impact the fire, life and safety protection of the students, staff, and school 
buildings. Below is more specific information on the condition of the
 
school and the efforts made to ensure that students 
are provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School Buildings: Piedmont was opened in 1960. This school has 47 regular classrooms, to include a computer lab, 
two art room
s, an instrumental music classroom, and a choral music room. A multipurpose room and a mini
-
gym building 
provide space for students to attend indoor assemblies and stage productions, eat lunch, and to participate in indoor 
sports. A library
-
media center pr
ovides instructional and media resources for students, teachers, and community 
members. The administration building provides offices for counselors, psychologist, clerical staff, and administrators. In 
addition to the main classrooms, there are five portab
le classrooms that have been added to provide addition classroom 
space.

Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work orde
r system process is used to ensure efficient service and 

in good working order. This site also had interior and exterior lighting upgr
ades completed through the Energy 
Conservation Assistance Act in identified areas throughout the campus.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule: The district has developed cleaning standards and schedules for all schools in the district. 
A summary of these standar
ds and schedules is available at the school or the Maintenance & Operations office. The 
principal, with the guidance of the maintenance supervisor works daily with the custodial team to ensure that the cleaning 
standards are met, and that classrooms, restr
ooms, and campus grounds are kept clean, safe, and well
-
maintained.
 
 
Modernization Projects: During the 2019 summer period, local bond funds (Measure L) were used to complete various 
modernization projects. These projects included installation of 
security fencing and a pavement rehabilitation of the front 
parking lot. All work described was completed prior to the start of the 19/20 school year.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Individual school sites offer Supplemental Instruction (SI) to students who are below grade level. It is up to 
each individual 
school sit e to identify the students who need extra support based upon district benchmarks or teacher recommendations. 
Each school site selects certificated and classified staff to teach these SI classes, usually after school (1 

 
3 days a
 
week). 
Each school also identifies the curriculum that will be used. The majority of the school sites select computer
-
 
based 
programs w here students can work independently at their current academic level. Some schools provide this time to 
receive help on
 
their homework.

Professional Development this school year occurred on 
many different levels 

 
before school started (summer of 2019) 
and ongoing throughout the 2019 

 
2020 school year.  The district office working with our site principals and curriculum 
leadership teams developed the scope/sequence of the professional develo
pment.  Leadership teams reviewed student 
data produced from benchmark tests, ELPAC, and SBAC data, as well as staff feedback when developing the scope and 
sequence.
 
 
At the beginning of the school year, all certificated and classified staff participated i
n two days of professional 
development aligned to their instructional role and needs.  TK
-
5 teachers received training on providing effective Tier 1 
instruction in math and ELA.  Special education staff, social workers and psychologists received training o
n topics pertinent 
to their needs such as All Learning is Social Emotional, TCI De
-
Escalation, Instructional Scaffolding to Assist and Support 
Student , and Data Collection and Behavior Management.  Middle school staff received specialized training related
 
to the 
content they teach, that focused on the social emotional element of learning as well as recently adopted curriculum.  All 
middle school teachers participated in a workshop on understanding gender.  Training for new teachers focused on 
introducing t

certificated colleagues in order to have the opportunity to collaborate while learning.  They also attended other sessions 
designed to meet their 
specific professional needs.
 
 
During the school year middle school, science teachers were released up to three days to collaborate on implementation 
of the new science program.  Middle school math and writing teachers scored and/or analyze student benchmar
ks during 
release days for each grade.  7th grade science teachers were released for 1
-

comprehensive sexuality program.  Additional training was offered on release day for special education teachers to 
support implemen
tation of our dyslexia curriculum as well as special education components of our ELA programs.

Throughout the school year, we offered monthly professional development sessions in which all teachers participated (1.5 
hours on 10 early release Thursday afte
rnoons).  Principals and district office administrators chose the topics for the 2019
-
2020 school year in alignment with the District focus on developing a multi
-
tiered system of support.
 
 
The Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL) program was implemented 
at six of our ten elementary schools in grades TK
-
3.  The schools included were Cherrywood, Laneview, Summerdale, Brooktree, Toyon and Vinci Park.   Teachers in the first 
two years of implementation received three two
-
day training modules each followed by 
a day of unit planning.  Teachers 
in the third and fourth year of implementation participated in three days of unit planning.  Contracted SEAL experts 
provided the module training sessions and three district instructional coaches facilitated the follow up 
planning PD 
sessions.  Teachers were released from their classrooms for all of these PD days.
 
 
Four instructional coaches provided BTSA induction training for all teachers who qualified to receive BTSA training and 
support. Additionally, BUSD teachers prov
ide PAR assistance to teachers who are in need of additional assistance.  All 
teachers have access to an instructional coach so that they can receive follow up support on implementing new learning 
attended through professional development.
 
 
An MTSS committ
ee and Differentiated Assistance Team received 3
-
5 days of training on change management facilitated 
by WestEd and the Santa Clara County Office of Education.  Some members also participated in 3 training sessions of 
equity.  Team members then trained prin
cipals during monthly professional development meetings.   The focus of both 
teams aligned with the district goal of developing multi
-
tiered systems of support at each site.
