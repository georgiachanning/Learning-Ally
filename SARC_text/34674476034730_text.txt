By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

MISSION STATEMENT
 
Guiding the discovery of knowledge, Mission Avenue Open School inspires and engages all students to become responsible 
citizens and creative, confident, 
critical
-
thinking problem solvers through student
-
centered interdisciplinary learning, 
enhanced by experiential explorations in respectful collaborations within our community.
 
 
SCHOOL PROFILE
 
Mission Avenue Open School is an officially
-
designated alternati
ve school in the San Juan Unified School District.
 
 
Mission School is guided by a unified philosophy that provides a high quality, standards
-
based, and comprehensive 
elementary school education through experiential learning. This is called the Open Philoso
phy and is based, in part, on 


nd 

themes: differentiation of instruction, experiential learning and constructivism, student
-
centered collaborative 
classrooms, fie
ld education, and parent involvement at all levels of the school program.
 
 
We believe applications of technology are critical to teaching and learning at all grade levels.  To support this belief, eac
h 
of our classrooms has access to Chromebooks and an App
le TV set up.  All classrooms are WiFi enabled as we recognize 
that use of the internet is one technological key for students' success and, as such, plays an important role in hands
-
on 
learning, daily practical applications, and 21st century skills which a

 
 

program,  Mission School offers band and choir programs, as well as multiple 
opportunities for all children to perform in 
grade
-
level and school
-
wide performances.
 
 
PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE
 
Children are a gift
--
each day that we see them engaged in learning alongside us, we recognize and are thankful for that 
gift!  Our philosophy at Mis
sion is much more than a slogan, much more than a sign we hang on the building 
-
 
our 
philosophy, our community, and our teaching methods are our PRIORITY, and the success we see is the result.
 
 
At Mission Avenue Open School, we are committed to the idea th
at parents are an integral part of the learning experience, 
both inside and outside the classroom.  Learning is best accomplished when teachers, parents, and students work as a 
team.  Hand in hand, as part of the team, making academic choices, setting goal
s, and evaluating progress, students 
become responsible lifelong learners.  We continuously encourage parent volunteerism, and those hours extend into our 
experiential learning activities where children are on single day and multi
-
day field trips to take t
he learning outside of 
our four walls of the classroom.  We call this an "Open Philosophy" and we are committed to the Open Philosophy because 

o embrace 
this philosophy, who recognize the remarkable, exciting, and distinguished learning community we've created at Mission 
Avenue Open School.

During this school year our focus is on K
-
2 guided reading, literacy, K
-
6 math, and newly adopted material
s which all 
support Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and rigorous instruction with powerful assessments that teach us more 
about what our students are capable of doing and what they are ready to do next.  Staff are poised for engaging students 
in critica
l thinking on work aligned with the Common Core State Standards, while continuing to guide children through 
learning experiences that are constructivist at the core.  With much positive momentum, we are looking forward to our 
next steps with children.
 
 
At 
Mission Avenue Open School, we thrive by working with our community to engage children in rich learning experiences.  
The learning at Mission is unique and most certainly special.  We engage children in parent
-
funded learning experiences 
that take place ou
tside of the classroom, and we ask children to make meaning of their learning and put it into action.  
Our philosophy stretches across every aspect of what we do.  If you are interested in attending the school site on a regular 
basis and find that our phil
osophy is a good match for your child, we encourage you to call or visit our site and learn more.

Year 
and month in which data were collected:
 
September, 2018
 
 
San Juan Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018 and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equ
ipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom a
nd to take home. 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are rev
iewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption. The table disp
lays information collected in September 2018 about the quality, currency, and availability of 
the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. If you would like more information 
on the textbooks and instructional materi
als please visit our website: http://www.sanjuan.edu/Page/23485 In July 2009, 
EC Section 60200.7. The State Board of Education has adopted frameworks for ELA/ELD, Math, Science and Social 
Sciences, and has identified an approved list of instructional mater
ials available for adoption. For more information

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Mission Avenue Elementary School was modernized during 1995. A heating and air
-
conditioning upgrade was added 
during the summer of 2000. The modernization scope 
included roof/repair or replacement, interior, and exterior painting, 
new lighting, selected window system replacement, energy management system for the HVAC, new doors with 
handicapped accessible hardware, restroom restoration, electrical infrastructure u
pgrade to provide for internet, cable, 
telephone, throughout the school. Currently, there is sufficient space to house the student population. There is a site 
custodial staff that cleans the building, along with district support for major/minor repairs. Th
e district provides gardening 
and landscape services on a regular schedule. Regular fire/emergency drills are held, and badges are required for all 
visitors and personnel. Field repair, driveway resurfacing, and irrigation system retrofit continue to be a 
concern. The 
entire school was carpeted in 2003. Exterior painting of all facilities under Deferred Maintenance during Summer 2007. 
The area known as the "dust bowl" was irrigated and hydroseeded during Summer 2010.
 
 
The Board of Education and the Superint
endent's policy is to ensure that all students are provided with a safe and well
-
maintained learning environment. The board approved resolutions in 1998 and 2002 to adequately fund maintenance 
activities and preserve the repairs and improvements funded by 
two facility bond measures. The school buildings, 
classrooms and grounds are safe, clean and functional. An inspection of the facility was conducted in October 2019 and 
determined that there were no unsafe conditions that required emergency repairs. Distri
ct maintenance staff ensures 
that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
computer automated work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs and health 
and 
safety repairs are given the highest priority. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards and custodial staffing 
requirements for all schools in the district. This school meets the Board's standards for custodial staffing and cleanliness.
 
Th
e school's custodians are trained in the proper use of cleaning chemicals and Integrated Pest Management techniques. 
They are managed day to day by the Principal with assistance from the district's maintenance department. The district 
participates in the S
tate School Deferred Maintenance Program, with funding allocated for major repair or replacement 
of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior paintin
g, and floor systems.Annually the district budgets $2 million dollars for deferred 
maintenance activities.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress 
[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or
 
programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

As critical partners in their child's education, parents are vital to the open
-
structured program at Mission Avenue.  Parents 
work with staff to provide an environment that allows students to develop a love of learning that is reflected both at home 
and wi
thin the school community.  Parents enhance their child's education by providing additional resources, skills, and 
talents before, during, and after school.  At Mission Avenue Open School, we believe that when parents and teachers work 
together, students a
re motivated to reach their highest potential. Mission Avenue Open School has created a learning 
environment that includes the support and active participation of all parents.  This is accomplished by their assistance in 
classroom, school, and/or at
-
home a
ctivities for a requested minimum two hours per week per child.  Parents are also 
highly encouraged to consistently attend general programs and class meetings.  Compacts (which outline parent, staff and 
student responsibilities) are signed yearly, affirmin
g understanding of a commitment to our students' education, the 
school philosophy, and program.  Parents participate in decision
-
making at parent meetings such as PTA, the English 
Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), Regional LCAP (Local Control and Accounta
bility Plan), and School Site Council 
meetings.
 
 
Parents assume responsibility for planning family education nights, family workdays, and family all
-
school events.  
Likewise, parents take full responsibility for planning all the fundraising activities that
 
generate funds to purchase 
additional programs that enrich learning for all students.

Professional development is a key part of the continuous improvement process for educators. The goal of our quality 
professional development is to support the learning of teachers and paraprofessionals to 
positively impact student 
achievement.  Annually, teachers and site administrators participate in professional development in a variety of 
opportunities.  Seventy
-
five minutes per week are dedicated to staff collaboration and training planned by site leade
rship 
teams. The District also provides a cycle of continuous professional development for Administrators through Principal 
Networks as well as Leadership Academies.
 
 
The District provides professional development opportunities for teachers and 
administrators that support the 
implementation of Common Core State Standards in English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and the 
ELA/ELD Framework.  Specific professional development initiatives include: Culturally Responsive Practices
, Critical 
Literacy, TK
-
2 Reading, Supporting Independence and Engagement through Reading and Writing, Math to the Core, 
Expository Reading and Writing Course, and ELD Foundations.  District departments, Center for Teacher Support, grant
-
funded projects, a

development opportunities are voluntary for teachers and are provided throughout the year in a variety of formats: during 
the school day, after school, on Saturd
ays, and during summer and vacation breaks. Many teachers and administrators 
also take advantage of opportunities with Sacramento County Office of Education, California Department of Education, 
the college/university programs, state/national education orga
nizations, and private educational institutes.
 
 
What grounds the professional development in the district is the District Strategic Plan and the Local Control 
Accountability Plan. Professional Development is further determined using one or more of the foll
owing: (a) student 
achievement data, (b) staff survey data, and (c) district
-
identified goals.  Professional development addresses the Common 
Core State Standards, teaching strategies, curriculum, assessment, technology, classroom management, safety, and 
l
eadership. Administrator training accompanies professional development in district focus areas, providing 
implementation support for teachers on site.  Content
-
area coaches are available at some schools.  Additional classroom 
support is provided to new and
 
struggling teachers by consulting teachers from the Center for Teacher Support.
