https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and 
comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic 
system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., 
the California State Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally 
provided on a first

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Santa 
Clara is located on a 1.7
-
acre site. The school contains one permanent classroom and two relocatable classrooms. The schoolhouse (the permanent 
classroom) is a historic structure classified by the Ventura County Historical Society as a Historic Landmark. T
he facilities are used to house a library, 
kitchen, computer areas, resource area, classrooms, and office area. The schoolhouse serves as a multipurpose room for studen
ts to gather, for parents 
to gather, for program performances, and, on occasion, as an e
ating area for students.
 
 
Procedures are in place regarding campus safety for fire, earthquake, active shooter, and emergency preparedness. Order and s
afety on campus are a 
high priority. The school secretary also serves as the yard supervisor for recess a
nd lunch. The ratio of students to playground supervisors is no more 
than 28:1. The Santa Clara custodian cleans the rooms every other day. He is conscientious and hardworking in maintaining a c
lean school. The school is 
regularly inspected for safety. Sch
ool facilities are regularly maintained and repaired.
 
 

 
The roofs on the schoolhouse and portable classrooms were inspected and maintained in 2017.
 

 
The HVACs and lighting were replaced in December of 2017.
 

 
The asphalt was repaired and extended in the park
ing area in August of 2017.
 

 
The exterior of the schoolhouse and portable classrooms was painted in June of 2019.  The interior of the schoolhouse was pai
nted in December 
of 2019.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the S
tate priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education populat
ion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
alig
ned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy th
e requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Prior
ity 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site

education. Parents play a crucial role at Santa Clara through their active participation and 
involvement. There are two active, organized parent groups: the School Site Council (SSC) serves as an advisory council, and 
the Parent Teacher 
Organization (PTO) 
raises money and in many other ways supports Santa Clara Elementary and its students.  Parents volunteer in classrooms, chape
rone 
on field trips, attend Student of the Month Assemblies, and participate in other school activities and events.  Communication
 
is open and ongoing.
 
 
For more information on how to become involved, please contact Kari Skidmore, Principal, at 805.525.4573.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rat
es;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Santa Clara School acknowledges responsibility to create a learning environment that will allow students to achieve at grade 
level standards and beyond, 
dev
elop self
-
discipline, take responsibility for their actions and learn to work cooperatively with others. To accomplish this, educators 
maintain high 
expectations for student behavior and communicate these through a Discipline Plan. The Plan is distributed 
to the students and parents annually in the 
Santa Clara Handbook. Severe misbehavior results in a referral to the principal. Suspension from school can be the result of 
extreme misbehavior. The 
Board of Education can expel a student for a serious offense. 
The regulations for suspension and expulsion are explained in the Handbook. The purpose 
of the discipline policy is to assist students in taking responsibility for their own behavior. School rules are clearly stat
ed and discussed with the students. 
Rules, 
rewards, and consequences are enforced fairly and consistently. Except for minor infractions, teachers contact the parents wh
en rules are broken. 
Classroom disruptions are minimal and student referrals to the principal are rare.
 
 
A variety of activities an
d programs provide Santa Clara students special recognition and fun participation throughout the course of the school year. T
he 
emphasis is on positive reinforcement of responsible behavior.
 
 
All staff must wear identification badges at all times.  All vis
itors must sign in the school office and receive a volunteer/visitor badge.   Volunteers/visitors 
to the school are asked by school staff to display badges at all times.

the standards and implement 
the State educational program. There are three
 
student
