School Description
 
Hidden Springs Elementary School is located within a planned community in the northwest section 
of the Moreno Valley Unified School District. Hidden Springs Elementary School was dedicated on 
June 12, 1993. Our district motto, "Excellence on Purpose," is d
esigned to convey the value placed 
on student potential and the nurturing atmosphere of the school community.
 
 
Hidden Springs School has 21 general education classes, a Transitional Kindergarten class, two 
special education classes for moderate/severe stud
ents, and one full
-
time Resource Specialist 
teacher (RSP). Our part
-
time staff includes a counselor, a speech therapist behavior support 
specialist, and a school psychologist.
 
 
Hidden Springs is a school with a diverse population in which eight 
languages are spoken. The 
diversity of our school community offers opportunities for expanded cultural experiences that 
enhance the lives of our students. Parent volunteers are an integral and essential part of the 
school's instructional program. Our schoo
l has parents and staff who comprise an active and 
supportive Booster Club, School Site Council (SSC), District English Learner Advisory Committee 
(DELAC),  and African American Advisory Council (AAAC).
 
 
Our goal is to provide an educational program, based
 
on State and District curriculum standards, 
which fosters the total development of our students. We envision our school as a partnership with 
families, promoting the intellectual, social, emotional, cultural, and physical development of all 
students. Toge
ther we define expectations, provide inspiration, and share a collective responsibility 
in the education our students.
 
 
Hidden Springs has received the  honors of California Distinguished School, Riverside County's 
Models of Academic Excellence,  Californi
a School Board Association's Golden Bell Award, and

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
