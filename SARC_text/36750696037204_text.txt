School Description
 
Baldy View Elementary, built in 1954, is located in Upland, California at the base of the San Gabriel 
Mountains. Backed by Mt Baldy, hence our name, families are welcomed with open arms. We are 
one of ten elementary schools in our district.  We have twenty
-
two classrooms, which service 
Transitional Kindergarten through 6th grade students from our community.
 
 

of learners with a strong commitment to 
reaching their full potential. The expectation is that 
students and staff meet academic standards, recognize and appreciate individual and cultural 
differences, and effectively learn to resolve problems that continuously challenge a global society. 
Student


inspires all students to maximize their academic potential
 
and to thrive in a complex global society."
 
 
Each year we strive to better our programs for student learning. We are excited to continue our 
school wide implementation of Thinking Maps ( A common Language for Teaching and Learning), 
Daily 5/CAFE reading s
trategies and structure for Literacy for grades K 
-
 
3, and AVID strategies in 
grades 4 
-
 
6.  Teachers have ongoing  training opportunities in these two initiatives.  In the 2018
-
2019, year the campus received a Silver Award in observance of our implementat
ion of  PBIS 
(Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports) across the campus. Baldy View received a grant 
and district support in purchasing ST Math, an online "Spatial and Temporal" math program for 
grades K 
-
 
6, which is still in use and offers studen
ts experiences in problem solving and deductive 
thinking. To support literacy, Baldy View has a reading lab, led by a Reading Specialist, that offers 
both push
-
in and pull
-
out opportunities to support students in areas of phonemic awareness, 
phonics, vocab
ulary, and comprehension.  In addition to the lab and our teaching staff, an RSP 
Teacher, Librarian, Instructional Aides, and Bilingual Aides provide the extra support needed in the 
classrooms where students require more assistance to improve their skills.
 
 
With the generous support of our community and the adoption of Measure K, during the summer 


ctronic teaching wall 
with interactive boards, projection/audio systems, and skylights. Currently, Grades K 
-
 
6 are one
-
to
-
one ratio with Chromebooks and teachers throughout the campus work through Google 
Classroom. Additionally, teachers will check out th
e district Google Expedition kit to take students 
on virtual field trips to mountain ranges and libraries beyond our state, country, and even 
continent.
 
 
Baldy View has provided many after school clubs for enrichment over the past few years. Some of 
the cl
ubs that have been offered include: homework, garden, Coding & Chess, and math 
enrichment. We are excited to offer these programs, directed by teachers, support staff, and local 
consultants throughout the week for minimal or no cost to parents. Think Toget
her is an after 
school program established through state funds to keep kids safe after school. This program has a 
maximum of 120 students with five trained adults.  Think Together meets every school day from 
the end of the day until 6:00 p.m. During the af
ternoon, students work on homework for one hour 
as well as take part in additional enrichment programs.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The culture of our school reflects energy, enthusiasm, and a commitment to learning with high academic standards. At Baldy Vi
ew, we set the bar high 
and support our community of learners in meeting or exceeding grade level sta
ndards. Students, parents, and staff all work together to ensure that this 
goal is met. For example, we challenge our parents to complete the district Parent Passport.  This document challenges them t
o attend both site and 
district wide events to get stamp
s for their participation.  Some key annual events that brings many parents to our campus are Donuts with Dad, Muffins 
with Mom, and our Grandparent luncheon.  At the end of the year a parent event is held to recognize those that succeeded in f
illing their
 
passports.
 
 
Our PTA becomes a stronger unit each year. They are a hardworking group that is  focused on student and school needs; they ta
ke the initiative to make 
our school a pleasant and welcoming place for everyone. Our PTA provides us with funds to su
pport school activities, assemblies, grade level field trips, 
and 6th grade end

Beyond PTA, Baldy View has a wealth of opportunities for parent involvement.  Some of these include: school spirit days, Pare

Ki
ndergarten Writing Workshops for parents, a non

competitive field day, Read Across America celebration, Family nights, Country Fair, Family Fun night 
with Community fair, and our nighttime musical performances (what many consider to be the highlight of the
 
year).  On these nights, families are invited 
to participate and celebrate with us as their students perform music, poetry, and dances they've worked hard on over the prio
r weeks.
 
 

library and office, and assist with extracurricular activities. Many of our events 
have been featured in our local newspaper spotlighting the students, families and community; they demonstrate how important p

fortunate and grateful for the great support from our parents in teaming with us to work towards academic excellence.

School Safety Plan
 
One of the characteristics of an effective school is a safe and orderly campus. Our number one commitment is to the safety of
 
all who attend Baldy View 
Elementary. The district provides a safety plan developed by school representatives that is reviewed yea
rly in August. Monthly safety committee meetings 
are held at the district with a representative from each site attending. Information is brought back to our school safety com
mittee who then aligns 
procedures and routines to our specific site needs. This pl
an is comprehensive,  practiced during school hours and reviewed at monthly staff meetings. 
Specific safety objectives are practiced to mastery each month through school
-
wide fire, disaster (earthquake) and lock
-
down drills. Objectives for drills 
include s
tudent behavior and procedures, attendance and search/sweep procedures. Located on our campus is a disaster bin to support st
udent and 
adult needs, should we become a community shelter. Water and emergency supplies are stored and replenished on a yearly ba
sis. We have a gated 
campus where all visitors are required to enter the office to have their licensed scanned through our RAPTOR system. There is
 
a network of surveillance 
cameras throughout the campus that is monitored in the office and recorded to our s
erver.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The Upland Unified School District believes that high quality, research
-
based professional development is essential to continuous improvement of 
teaching skills and concepts. The District provides or coordinates on
-
going training based on needs identified 
through student performance indicators, 
including results of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, the English Language Proficiency Assessme
nts for California, District 
iReady benchmark assessments, and input from sites regarding s
pecific needs. Professional development is aligned with the District Strategic Plan for 
Student Achievement and Board goals. Teachers, paraprofessionals and administrators participate in workshops, and conferences
 
that allow them to 
grow professionally and
 
provide opportunities for collegial sharing. Regular meetings of teacher leaders in literacy, mathematics, reading interventi
on 
and technology as well as follow
-
up coaching support full implementation of training. Additionally, each school provides time f
or teacher collaboration 
on student achievement data, curriculum development, and review of classroom
-
based performance measures. Examples of workshops and coaching 
implemented as the result of analysis of student achievement include: Effective Teaching St
rategies, Classroom Management, Curriculum Alignment and 
Mapping, English Language Development, AVID, Thinking Maps, Positive Behavior Intervention Support, Social Emotional Learning
, 21st Century 
Classroom Technology, Common Core State Standards, Next Gen
eration Science Standards, Modeling Academic Language, Universal Design for Learning, 
and Parent Engagement. Staff members participate in professional development in all
-
day workshops, after
-
school workshops and meetings, individual 
coaching/mentoring, and
 
off
-
site conferences. The Induction (formerly BTSA) program provides support to new teachers. The Peer Assistance and Review 
Program is available to provide support to teachers in the areas of content knowledge and teaching strategies. Currently, the
 
Dist
rict calendar includes a 
collaboration day schedule each week to allow for on
-
going teacher dialogue and collaboration to meet student needs.
