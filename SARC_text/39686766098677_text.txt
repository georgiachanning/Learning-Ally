About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional in
formation about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have
 
books in core classes for all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far mor
e meaningful when along with 
the more detailed description of textbooks conta

in our core classes and their dates of publication.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Bal
anced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible studen
ts 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The perce
ntage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Our school recognizes that parents and the community play an important role in the success and education of their students. M
any schools have 
established partnerships with community businesses and organizations to increase parent 
participation. Each school offers several opportunities and 
programs to encourage parent involvement.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: S
chool Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 

s custodial team ensures the school facilities 
are in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. Each year a deep cleaning process occurs during a
 
close of school, either during 
the summer or other extended breaks. In the event of
 
a facility plant emergency, the principal notifies appropriate site and district personnel to resolve 
the emergency and safely secure or evacuate the students, based upon the site and district emergency preparedness plans. A si
te review with the district 
Internal Evaluation Instrument (IEI) occurs annually. A comprehensive School Safety Plan, which was recently reviewed by the 
School Site Council, helps 

aredness Plan identifies procedures to follow 
during emergencies and natural disasters. Emergency drills are conducted on a regular basis. Every effort is made to ensure s
tudents are monitored while 
on campus throughout the school day. Yard supervisors, te
achers, site administrators and school staff provide supervision for students before and during 
school. The playground is safe for all students. All visitors must sign in at the office and receive proper
 
authorization to be on campus.
