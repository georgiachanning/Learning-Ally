A Message from the Principal
 
The Burbank Bulldogs are a community of dedicated educators, supportive adults, and
 
enthusiastic, talented learners. Our 
continuous improvement on federal and state measures demonstrates increased student knowledge which is preparing 
them for a successful future.  Our students participate in a rigorous academic program enriched with visu
al, performance, 
and folk arts opportunities. Burbank Bulldogs are the Best!
 
 
Bulldog Learning
 
The Burbank staff provides many opportunities for students to excel. The core program includes reading groups, literature 
study, Thinking Maps, and the writing p
rogram, "Write from the Beginning and Beyond" to integrate reading and writing 
activities. Students in TK through 6th grade learn math with the Swun Math model which allows students not only to perform 
calculations, but also to think about, describe, and e
xplain mathematical concepts as found in the Common Core Standards. 
Each teacher strives to differentiate instruction to support students at the many different learning levels. Students who 
need more support are helped with a multi
-
tiered approach to inter
vention. All students are encouraged to grow and excel 
at Burbank Elementary.
 
 
Bulldog Community
 
Burbank is a school in and of the community. Burbank Elementary provides many services for families and children. Burbank 
provides two after
-
school programs, E
XTRA and Extended Day Program (EDP) with homework help, arts and crafts, and 
outside games. The staff and PTA team up to provide family activities throughout the year for families to have fun and learn 

 
Parent Education classes five days a week. Students can 
participate in an extensive variety of after
-
school enrichment classes throughout the year. Two different sessions of classes 
offer dance, music, crafts, singing, gardening, exercise and nutrition, a
nd more. Parents, students and staff celebrate and 
honor our students' citizenship and academic accomplishments at trimester awards assemblies.
 
 
Bulldog Talent
 
Our students explore their talents through the Visual, Performing, and Folk Arts Magnet program.
 
Using our Fine Arts Center, 
the students practice and perform for students and parents.  Students act, sing, dance, create props, and serve as stage 
hands for theatrical performances. We enjoy a student performance each month.  Visual arts are explored th
rough class 
and grade

-
school club 
which performs two concerts every year.  The award

winning Burbank Spirit Squad and all boys Dawg Squad perform every 
mont
h for spirit day and participate in a regional competition in the spring. Upper grade students can participate in student 
leadership by devoting service to the school and to the community. All children explore their talents as Burbank Bulldogs!
 
 
Artesia's 
history is as much tied to its schools as it is to the many naturally flowing wells giving Artesia its name. Luther 
Burbank Elementary School, in fact, is located not far from the site of Artesia's first school. The opening of this two

current successes. At Burbank, students are challenged and encouraged to excel in all curricular areas. The staff aspires to

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Our teachers actively seek opportunities for professional growth to provide effective instruction 
with a focus on student learning outcomes.  Staff 
development is based on the assessed needs of the school personnel and on data from district and state assessments in ELA and
 
Math. Staff members 
work collaboratively to determine the school's needs and tak
e direction from District and State requirements when establishing professional 
development goals for the school year.  Schoolwide training focus areas include Swun math, Thinking Maps, Write From the Begi
nning and Beyond, 
District Writing Genres and Rubri
cs, and Google Classroom Technology, and Wonders ELA curriculum. Staff members build teaching skills and concepts 
by participating in many site supported coaching sessions and workshops throughout the year and by sharing their experiences 
and knowledge wit
h 
colleagues. Common Core State Standards in the area of English Language Arts and English Language Development Listening and S
peaking standards is 
the emphasis of district wide professional development this year.
