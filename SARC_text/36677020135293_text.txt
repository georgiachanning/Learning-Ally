By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Falcon Ridge opened its doors on August 7, 2017, as the 17th school in the Etiwanda School District.  Our focus has been 
on 
establishing a rich learning environment for all students providing access to a rigorous core curriculum in language arts, 
mathematics, science, and social science.  We have a strong literacy plan focused on guided reading to assure all students 
are profic
ient readers before they leave Falcon Ridge at the end of 5th grade.  Our student
-
centered program design offers 
caring teachers who possess a strong professional concern for all students at all ability levels; multiple programs to suppor
t 
developing learn
ers; and culturally
-
diverse, mixed
-
ability classrooms where students feel comfortable engaging in learning 
from the teacher and one another.  Parents and the community play a very important role in the school.   Falcon Ridge is 
establishing a culture where
 
parents feel confident their students are receiving a well
-
rounded educational experience in 
a safe and welcoming environment and students feel safe and happy coming to school to learn. Communicating about the 
educational program, student achievement, and
 
curriculum development can assist both school and community in 
ongoing program improvement.
 
 
Our school motto, Love of Learning is the Guide of Life, is borrowed from Phi Beta Kappa Society which is a widely 
recognized and prestigious honor society at col
leges throughout the United States. The Greek letters Phi Beta Kappa 

arts and sciences and recognizes model students who demonstrate q
ualities important to learning.
 
 
At Falcon Ridge we want all children to LOVE learning and develop a passion for discovery that will last forever. Children 
are naturally curious and intrigued by the world they live in. We hope to foster these instincts and
 
encourage them to be 
engaged in their education now and in the future.  We will teach children the standards and subject matter they are 

y 
are in school to spark their imaginations, create deeper thinking about learning, and to put them at the controls of their 
own education for a lifetime. It is important for young people to get good grades and take initiative towards academic 
achievement;
 
however, instilling a love of learning is a gift they will have for a lifetime.  At Falcon Ridge, we will make this 
a reality.

Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Falcon Ridge Elementary provides a safe and clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance and 
campus supervision. Original school buildings were constructed in 2017. Ongoing maintenance ensur
es school facilities 
are kept safe, in good working condition, and continue to provide adequate space for students and staff.
 
 
Falcon Ridge Elementary is proud of its high standards regarding campus maintenance and general housekeeping 
practices. Staff and
 
students enjoy the benefits of having a well
-
maintained and beautiful campus.

School staff and the maintenance department work together to ensure playgrounds, classrooms, and campus grounds are 
well
-
maintained. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) oversees a
 
work order process enabling school staff to 
communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Teachers, support staff, and the 
principal collaborate efforts to prepare and submit work orders to M&O for resolution. Emergency s
ituations are given 
high priority and resolved immediately by site or district custodial staff. The principal, school secretary, and day custodia
n 
communicate each morning on an informal basis to discuss schedules, campus maintenance, and safety concerns. 
The 
director of maintenance and operations (M&O) meets with the assistant principal once a month to discuss maintenance
-
related issues associated with campus upkeep, safety, classroom space, equipment, upcoming events, work orders 
(submitted and outstandin
g), and special requests. The director of M&O then meets with the custodian to conduct a 
comprehensive inspection of the school site, and a summary of the inspection findings is forwarded to the assistant 
principal.
 
 
Schools are required by state law to co
nduct a formal inspection annually of designated areas and systems and then 
prepare a report of the current condition of facilities.  The School Site Inspection table illustrated in this report identif

maintenance, and minor repairs. M&O provides formal training twice a year on the proper use o
f equipment, cleaning 
procedures, and chemical usage. One full
-
time day custodian is responsible for keeping the campus clean and fully 

the 
cafeteria after meals are served. Every morning before school begins, the day custodian inspects school facilities for safety
 
hazards and maintenance issues that require attention before staff and students arrive on campus. Restrooms are checked 
throug
hout the day as a proactive measure in keeping facilities stocked, sanitary, and safe. Any graffiti or signs of 
vandalism are removed immediately.
 
 
A professional janitorial service is responsible for thoroughly cleaning classrooms and restrooms during the
 
evenings. The

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The
 
SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative A
ssessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participat
e in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students wh
o have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: P
arental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parental Involvement is a priority
 
outlined by the state in the Local Control Accountability Plan and is extremely valued at 
Falcon Ridge Elementary and in the Etiwanda School District.  The district holds community forums two times a year to 
offer parents a chance to be informed about the
 
LCAP and to engage parents in giving feedback about our schools and 
district to our leaders.  The forums allow district and site administrators to share the current plan to meet the priorities 
of 
the LCAP with parents and to answer questions from parents.
  
At the end of the forum, parents are asked to give feedback 
about what they learned as well as share what they would like to see the district implement to meet our LCAP goals. 
Administration actively invited parents from Falcon Ridge to participate in th
is event.  At Back to School Night at the 
beginning of August, parents are given the opportunity to provide feedback for the direction of the district and school 
sites in the form of a parent survey.  All parents were encouraged to participate in the surve
y process.  This survey is used 
to address concerns and to implement new programs for our school.
 
 
One of the most important parts of opening a new school is building a community where everyone feels valued and 
welcomed.  A strong sense of community was es
tablished through a spirited dedication ceremony in 2017.  Families and 
community members came to support the opening of the school and to dedicate the school to the students and families 
of Falcon Ridge. Back to School Night is held the Friday before scho
ol begins to allow students to meet their teachers and 
familiarize themselves with the campus.   Falcon Ridge has other opportunities for parents to be involved in the school 
community including a Fall Festival, Open House, student performances, award cere
monies, parent education nights, PTA, 
School Site Council, GATE advisory committee, volunteering in classrooms and on field trips, WATCH D.O.G.S., and African 
American Parent and Educator Advisory Committee (AAPEAC). Parents who would like to get more invo
lved or volunteer 
their time may contact the school secretary or clerk at (909) 463
-
6111.   School to home communication takes place in a 
variety of formats such as flyers, automated telephone system, classroom newsletters, and parent conferences.  General
 
information about the school is also available on the website (www.fr.etiwanda.org).  Aeries Parent Portal is available for 
parents to view the most current progress of their child's grades.  Ongoing assessment data is shared with parents 
throughout the y
ear to allow parents to monitor progress.   Involving parents in their children's education is critical to the 
success of the growth and development at Falcon Ridge.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan was originally developed for Falcon Ridge Elementary School in collaboration 
with local agencies and district administration to fulfill Senate Bill 
187 requirements. Components of this plan include child 
abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, 
procedures for safe arrival and departure from school, sexual harassment policy, and dress
 
code policy. The most current 
school safety plan is updated every year in October and shared with school staff upon completion.  School Site Council 
reviews and recommends edits and/or approval in December of each year. Local law enforcement signs the pla
n and then 
the plan is submitted to the Board of Trustees for approval on an annual basis.
