Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
In 2000 The Freshwater School District completed the
 
modernization of 10 classrooms, the building of a new girls' 
restroom, the remodeling of three other restrooms, and the retrofit of the office area. The modernization gave the school 
a major "facelift", adding high quality carpets, safety glass windows, n
ew electrical systems and data ports, and inside 
painting to all 10 classrooms. The new student restrooms are beautifully appointed with new fixtures and tile walls and 
floors. The office area gives additional space for the business functions of the Distri
ct. The lighting in the classrooms was 
retrofitted in 2009/10. The school houses all of its students as well as providing a library, computer lab, meeting room, 
auditorium/cafeteria, music rooms, and After School Care. The new gymnasium was completed and h
as been a huge asset 
for the entire school community.

In 2007/08 we added 196 solar panels that generate approximately 60% of the school's electricity needs. During this time 
we also added two relocatable classrooms, which are utilized as the library and 
computer lab. Most recently we repaved 
and restriped our parking lot to improve student safety, and have begun replacing failing water and sewer lines. In addition 
we have begun replacing our old fluorescent lights with energy efficient LEDs, and will soon
 
begin work installing a new 

 
 
In the summer of 2017 Prop 39 allowed us to make further energy saving facility improvements. A new 39kW solar array 
was installed above the Kindergar
ten wing. Additionally, the District was able to utilize Prop 39 funds to procure a new 
roof above the Kindergarten wing, install new LED lights in the classrooms and remove a failing, 61

In June of 2018, The District passed Measure C, a $2.1 million dollar General Obligation Bond to modernize and renovate 
our aging schools. This bond measure allowed us to improve our outdated plumbing systems, replace our roofs
, and 
upgrade our hardscape and landscape areas in the summer of 2019.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number 
of students who met the standard 
(i.e., achieved Level 3

can become involved in a variety of ways, including helping in the classroom, serving on one of the four parent groups 
associated with the school, vo
lunteering at special events, and gathering materials and supplies for the school. For 
example, families volunteer to help with the Garden of the Dolphins, art projects, field trips, electives, holiday parties, a
