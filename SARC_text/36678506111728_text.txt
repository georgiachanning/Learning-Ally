About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

rised of 21 permanent 
classrooms, seven portable classrooms, a conference room, 
an administrative office building, a cafeteria/multipurpose room, a library, one staff lounge, 
one staff workroom, a parent center, and two playgrounds. At the time of publication, 100% of all restrooms were in working c
ondition. The chart displays 
the res

work order process when 
time and funding is available.
 
 
School Safety 
 
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of F
itzgerald Elementary School. All visitors to the campus must sign in at the office and wear a 

nch, and after school. Supervision 
is
 
a responsibility shared among parent/guardian volunteers, teachers, and administrators. To further safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, a 
comprehensive School Site Safety Plan has been developed by the School Site Council. The Safety Plan was m
ost recently updated in March 2018; any 
revisions and updates are reviewed immediately with the staff. Key elements of the Safety Plan focus on the following: 
 

 
School rules & procedures
 

 
Disaster procedures/routine & emergency drills
 

 
Current status of schoo
l crime
 

 
Notification to teachers
 

 
Child abuse reporting procedures

wide dress code
 

 
Policies related to suspension/expulsion
 

 
Sexual harassment policy
 

 
Safe ingress & egress of pupils, parents/guardians, & school employees
 
The school is always in 
compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. Safety dri
lls, 
including fire, earthquake, and code yellow are held monthly.
 
 
Cleaning Process 
 
 
The school provides a safe and clean environ

for all schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the school year with emp
hasis on classrooms and 
restrooms. A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

staff to develop sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment. 
 
 
Maintenance & Repair 
 
 

nctions occurring during 
vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered by 
Rialto Unified School District to ensure that school grounds and 
facilities remain in excellent repair. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority; repair requests are completed effici
ently and in the order in which 
they are received. 
 
 
Facility Impr
ovements / Deferred Maintenance 
 
 
The district has a five year, Deferred Maintenance Plan designed to address expenditures for major repair or replacement of e
xisting school building 
components and any needed Facility Improvements. Typically this includes 
roofing, plumbing, heating electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, 
and floor systems.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summ
ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

A constructive evaluation process promotes quality instruction and is a fundamental element in a sound educational program. E
valuations and formal 

strict policies. Temporary and 
probationary teachers are evaluated twice a year and tenured teachers are evaluated every other year.
 
 
Evaluations are conducted by the principal, who has been trained and certified for competency to perform teacher evaluatio
ns. Evaluations are based 

in Learning; Understanding 
and Organizing Subject Matter for Student Learning; Assessing Student Learning
; Creating and Maintaining Effective Environments for Student Learning; 
Planning Instruction and Designing Learning Experiences for all Students; and Developing as a Professional Educator.
 
 
Due to the state fiscal crisis, additional funding from the State 
of California that would provide an opportunity to offer district

wide professional 

 
worked within the state 
fiscal crisis to provi
de an alternative plan of action for staff development, and has established a comprehensive District

wide Professional Development 
Center (PDC). The PDC provides ongoing staff development in a variety of formats throughout the school year (i.e. during the 
school day with substitutes 
provided, after school, on
-
site, weekends, and during instructional breaks). In collaboration with the PDC, teachers have access to online videos and 
resources as additional professional development support.
