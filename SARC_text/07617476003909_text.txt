Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Camino Pablo Elementary School is currently compri
sed of seven buildings, including 27 classrooms, a gymnasium, library, 
one computer lab, after school daycare facility, and one science lab. Through funding provided by Measure V, significant 
modernization efforts began in the Summer of 2019 and are nearin
g completion. The district
-
wide project intends to vastly 
improve the student experience through such initiatives as renovated classrooms, newly
-
designed bathrooms, and a 
rejuvenated basketball court.
 
 
Camino Pablo Elementary School provides a safe and cle
an environment for students, staff, and community members. 
Site custodians ensure a sanitary learning space through daily work that is supervised and inspected by site principals on 
a routine basis. All classrooms, restrooms, and athletic centers are prior
itized on the regular cleaning schedule. Outside 
trash is collected daily to reduce an unwanted animal presence on the school campus. The district recently added modern 
cleaning
-
chemical dispensers in the custodian closets to further guarantee the optimal 
cleaning agent is utilized for the 
right job. The site principal and custodians work in conjunction with the district Director of Buildings and Grounds to seek 
ways to increase the cleanliness of the CP campus regularly. The school is inspected annually by
 
the Fire Marshal and 
periodically by school site administrators.

The repair and maintenance of Camino Pablo Elementary School are prioritized and implemented by the Director of 
Buildings and Grounds. Work is carried out by the members of the Maintenance 
Department to ensure that the facilities 
remain in excellent repair. Generally, site custodians, secretaries, and principals submit tickets through the work order 
system for the Director of Buildings and Grounds to receive. Emergency repairs are given the 
highest priority, as is anything 
that poses a threat to student safety. Priorities for the Maintenance Department to address are the missing ceiling tiles in 
Room 9, as well as repair the damaged concrete area where portables had been utilized as temporary
 
classrooms during 
recent construction efforts.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are an 
integral part of the learning community at Camino Pablo School. Our parent community is well
-
informed 
and articulate, and we make much effort to include parents in all aspects of the functioning of the school. Parents 
volunteer in classrooms, school projec
ts, the cafeteria, and also assist with field trips, class parties and activities, copying 
in the office, and helping at home with many projects and assignments. Our PTA offers many opportunities for parents to 
be involved in school and community related e
vents such as serving as committee chairs and members, fundraising 
activities, legislative action, communication to other parents, and school
-
wide clean
-
up days.  The School Site Council, 
comprised of staff and parents, meets regularly to monitor, make sug
gestions and annually approve the Single Site Plan 
for Student Achievement. The Moraga Education Foundation (MEF) raises funds from the community in support of 
selected instructional programs. Our parent community financially supports school personnel, act
ivities, and events 
through many significant, generous donations.

wide staff development days were scheduled in each of the school years 2016
-
17, 2017
-
18, 2018
-
19. These 
days were scheduled and held outside the 180
-
day student 
calendar.  The focus of these professional development days 
in 2018
-
19 was to educate teachers, administrators and staff about the new common core state standards, specifically in 
the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), mathematics, and English Langu
age Arts (ELA).  The focus was selected in 
conjunction with the District's LCAP goals.  In addition, teachers were provided opportunities to attend workshop events 
that focused on learning about common core standards and how their instructional strategies 
will improve student 
learning.  Release time is provided for teachers to visit other schools, observe other classrooms and collaborate about 
instruction.  The Beginning Teacher Induction Program assigns new teachers with a mentor teacher.  This program is 
a 
two
-
year mandatory program for all new beginning teachers in the Moraga School District. Teachers receive support from 
one another, site administrators, consultants and the MSD teacher on special assignment.
