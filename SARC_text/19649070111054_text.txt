Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Safety of the students and staff is a primary concern of the Pomona Unified School District. All schools in the district are 
in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials. Cortez staff members recently 
reviewed and u
pdated the 2017
-

emergency evacuations. All buildings within the district are in compliance with state earthquake standards. Students and 
all staff conduct safety drills monthl
y. Also, all staff and students participate in a Disaster Drill yearly with simulated Search 
and Rescue procedures.
 
 
At Cortez Magnet, the focus on safety, a clean environment for students, staff and volunteers, health and well

implementation of the Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) framework for all students attending Cortez. 
Our discipline policy seeks to assure a 
safe and orderly environment for students and staff.

report the status of its school safety plan, including a description of its key elements in the annual school accountability 
report card prepared pursuant to Sections 33126 and 35256.
 
 
Education Code Section 
32286.
 
 
A Safe School Plan has been adopted, and it includes policies on:
 

 
disaster preparedness
 

 
student discipline
 

 
the components of a safe and orderly school environment
 

 
suspension/expulsion procedures
 

 
safety
 

 
child abuse reporting procedures

Pomona Unified School District is committed to providing high quality professional learning for administrators, teachers, 

academic ac
hievement.
 
 
District teachers and support staff participate in six Professional Development Days that are driven by student 
achievement data, staff learning needs, and research
-
based best practices. Six District

and colla
boration for 2019

as well as articulation with grade level and 
department colleagues to enhance instruction and assessment.   These focus areas are in direct alignment with federal, 
state, and district student achievement academic goals. In ad
dition to the district
-
wide professional development days, 
sites use their weekly late start Friday sessions, 2 additional hours per month, and 4 additional hours per year (once per 
semester), to analyze student achievement data in a collegial forum. They 
then design effective instructional interventions 


 

for Student Achievement (SPSA).
 
 
District and site professional development also includes trainings around 21st Century Teaching and Learning which 
include the California State Standards and the P21 Framework. Training
 
outcomes are to build the capacity of site and 
teacher leaders to lead the transition and implementation of the California State Standards. Sessions include themes such 
as the need for a paradigm shift in teaching and learning, the essential components of
 
the P21 Framework, California State 
Standards, English Learner standards and framework, equity and culturally responsive instruction, social and emotional 
learning, and integrating the use of technology to enhance/support instruction and learning. Perform

professional learning management system is supporting us in paving the way for various formats and structures that allow 
for increased voice, choice, and time around options for professional learning experiences. Ranging from traditional

Pomona Unified School District continues its commitment to providing quality professional learning opportunities in

tools, PUSD has provided 
a critical base for technology training classes. These session topics include Internet use, IO Assessment, Web 2.0 tools and 
creating and using multimedia as a vehicle to enhance teaching and learning.  To meet these goals, Educat
ional Technology

support for teachers who use technology
