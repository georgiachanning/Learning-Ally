By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements 
(Most Recent Year)
 
 
Ivanhoe Elementary School takes great efforts to ensure a safe, clean, and functional physical environment for students, 
staff, and volunteers. Sufficient space is provided for students and staff to support teaching and learning. This 
includes 
space provided by classrooms, playgrounds, and staff work rooms. To assist our school in this effort, the district uses a 
facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of this 
sur
vey are available at the district office. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be 
obtained by speaking with the school principal.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
Ivanhoe School received several upgrades in maintenance and repai
r.  This includes classroom repairs, asphalt resurfacing, 
sprinkler repairs, etc.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
In addition to custodial staff on duty during the school day, a team of maintenance specialists come in after hours for daily
 
cleaning. Distric
t and school maintenance staff work cooperatively with administrators to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Program
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides 
state matching funds on a 
dollar for dollar basis to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school build
ing 
components.  Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical system
s, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. The deferred maintenance program ensures that all class¬rooms and facilities are maintained 
to a degree of adequacy that allows for a good learning environment.
 
 
Facilities Improvements
 
During the summer
 
of 2015, Ivanhoe Elementary School made facilities improvements including roofing and painting.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
incl
udes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. 
Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilitie
s); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parent involvement and 
communication are essential to our school success. Ivanhoe Elementary School continually strives 
to involve parents by sharing information that helps parents understand and support school programs and by providing 
opportunities for parent participation in 
school activities.
 
 
There are numerous and varied opportunities for parent involvement, including but not limited to, attending school 
functions, participating in parent
-
teacher conferences, volunteering in classrooms, and chaperoning field trips. Parents 
may also serve on advisory committees and leadership teams, including, but not limited to, the English Learners Advisory 
Committee (ELAC), School Safety Committee, School Site Council (SSC) and PIQE training beginning in 2020. Parents may 
develop leadershi
p skills through additional opportunities for parental involvement offered at the site based on the 
district's Parent University schedule.

The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is designed to assist in maintaining a safe school envir
onment and preparing for 
emergencies. The school safety committee on campus has the responsibility of continuously reviewing the plan, gathering 
input from all stakeholders, and making revisions as needed.  The plan requires identification of security need
s, 
development of prevention and intervention techniques, evaluation of physical facilities, and communication with staff 
and students. The safety plan is fully compliant with federal and state regulations. An updated copy is available to the 
public at the
 
school office.
 
 

preparedness drills are conducted regularly and the school staff is appropriately trained.  IN addition, the school s
taff 
works closely with the Tulare County Sheriff's Department Community Based Officer in order to assess and address safety 
issues as they arise.
 
 
The school safety plan was approved by the Ivanhoe Elementary School 
-
 
School Site Council on October 2019 a
nd 
approved by the Visalia Unified School District Board of Education.

on student engagement and cooperative learning is offered during 
winter break so that teachers may implement new 
structures and strategies during the spring semester.  All novice teachers receive ongoing support and individualized

teachers.  Novice teachers who have preliminary credentials participate in the VUSD Teacher Induction Clear Credential
