About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by s
tate 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are req
uired to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is 
to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For mor
e information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the
 
school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
General
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the Los Angeles County Office
 
of Education. The results of this survey are available at the school office or at the district office.
 
 
School Buildings
 

ices. In 
addition, we have a 
cafeteria, gymnasium, weight room, computer lab, staff lounge, and library. There are a total of 49 classrooms

29 are permanent and 24 are re
-
locatable.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessa
ry to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The district governi
ng board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the dis
trict office. 
The Supervisor of Operations works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and
 
safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
Although the State no longer requires a Deferred Maintenance contribution, Lancaster School District is still dedicated to ma
intaining the facilities for 
our students.  These expenditures would include but not 
be limited to roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical, painting, and flooring.  For 
the 2019
-
20 school year, the district has budgeted $940,000 for deferred maintenance projects.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Project:
 
The playground asphalt was re
conditioned in 2019.

Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summ
ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number
