By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

In 2011, the Governor and State Legislature extended the suspension of State Board of Education (SBE) ado
ptions of 
instructional materials until the 2015

16 school year (Education Code Section 60200.7).  At this time the State has adopted 
frameworks for English Language Arts/ English Language Development, and math which will assist in our implementation 
of  C
alifornia's Common Core State Standards. We are currently piloting  State Board of Education adopted (January, 2014) 
instructional materials for math to reflect the rigor of the California's Common Core State Standards, teachers are 
developing curricula un
its, and various resources are provided as additional instructional materials. The State Board of 
Education adopted ELA/ ELD instructional materials in November 2015  which directed our pilot and adoption of new 
instructional materials.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mat
hematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCS
S] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or car
eer technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Centralia School District 
(CESD) welcomes, actively recruits, and values parental involvement in District and school 
programs. During the 2018
-
19 school year, CESD continued the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) process. This 
funding process affords school districts the oppo
rtunity to engage parents, teachers, employee groups, and the wider 
community to be a part of the development of the LCAP. Our LCAP committee membership was revised so that new 
members could share their voices while keeping some existing members so that th
eir expertise and experience were not 
lost. Members are representatives from each stakeholder group. In addition, public meetings were held to receive parent 
and community input. The culmination of the LCAP committee was the adoption of the 2019
-
20 LCAP on
 
June 19, 2019, 
by the Board of Trustees. The LCAP represents an opportunity to further strengthen the commitments between our district 
and our community on behalf of all of the students. 
 
 
Parents and families at Los Coyotes School are an integral part of
 
our students' education and success.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Los Coyotes Elementary. The Safe School Action Plan was 
developed by the School Safety Team with input from staff, teachers, 
law enforcement, parents, and School Site Council. 
The safety plan is reviewed and revised annually by all groups. New goals and tasks are added as necessary. The 2019
-
2020 goals of our Safe School Action Plan include the following goals:
 
 
Goal #1: Los Coy
otes School's climate shall reflect respect, tolerance, and pride for the diversity of culture, ethnicity, and 
philosophy.  It is a place where students demonstrate strong academic progress and show Coyote PRIDE (Positive 
-
 
Respect 
-
 
Integrity 
-
 
Dependabil
ity 
-
 
Excellence).
 
 
Goal #2: Los Coyotes School's climate shall provide an emotionally secure learning environment for all students.
 
 
Goal #3: Los Coyotes School provides a secure campus with careful monitoring and supervision of all areas to ensure 
studen
t safety and adherence to the rules.
 
 
Goal #4: Los Coyotes School provides for the safety of students and staff through a well
-
planned and implemented crisis 
response plan.

Centralia School District has developed a Disaster Plan for emergencies.  Staff 
members are in
-
serviced and assigned 
responsibilities for plan implementation.  The school and District participate in the annual California ShakeOut earthquake 
drill each October. The District also provided a district
-
wide Active Shooter Training in colla
boration with the Buena Park 
Police Department with follow up training in December.  Fire and other emergency drills are held monthly.  The school 
maintains a Safety Committee which meets, at a  minimum, four times a year to review safety issues, plan staf
f 
development, confer with local police and fire departments, and makes recommendations for improvement.
 
 
The plan provides students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes 
the following requirements of S
B 187 within their safe school plans: current status of school crime; child abuse reporting 
procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsion; notification to 
teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision 
of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and 
school employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.  Annually, the school evaluates 
and updates the plan. Safety procedures, including elements
 
of the Safe School Plan, are reviewed with school and District 
staff in the fall, at the start of each school year.
 
 
Los Coyotes School believes that to ensure a positive learning experience requires a safe and orderly environment. Toward 
this end, Los Co
yotes created a school
-
wide positive behavior intervention and support (PBIS) plan that communicates 
high expectations for student behavior. Each student receives training on behavior expectations twice a year. At the 
beginning of the school year or upon e
ntry into the school, parents are provided with a detailed description of the 
program. Students are expected to embrace the "PRIDE" attributes (Positive, Respectful, Integrity, Dependable and 
Excellence).  Teachers teach, monitor, enforce and exhibit these
 
attributes throughout the year. The school follows all 
District Board Policies including those pertaining to Safety, Suspension, Expulsion, and Mandatory Expulsion and Sexual 
Harassment Policy.
 
 
The Centralia School District's Board of Trustees reviews th
e safety plans annually by March 1.
