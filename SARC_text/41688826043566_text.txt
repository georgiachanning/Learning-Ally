School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Principal's Message
 
Lincoln Elementary School is a high performing school that prides itself on developing the whole child by creating a learning
 
environment that promotes the academic, civic
, and social and emotional growth of all students. Lincoln School has 473 
students enrolled in kindergarten through fifth grade. The average student
-
to
-
teacher ratio in grades kindergarten 
through third is 23 students per teacher, and in fourth and fifth g
rades, 32 students per teacher.
 
 
Reading is at the heart of teaching and learning at Lincoln. Students and teachers love to read
 
-
 
and independent reading 
is an important part of classroom discussion and sharing. Developing students' mathematical thinking and problem
-
solving 
is also a key component of the instructional day at Lincoln. Students develop number sense and flexible math
ematical 
thinking by practicing a variety of strategies for solving problems and explaining their thinking.
 
 
The development of 21st Century Skills is also an essential component of teaching and learning at Lincoln School. The 21st 
Century Skills include c
reativity, innovation, critical thinking, problem solving, communication, and collaboration. The 
Responsive Classroom approach to teaching provides the backdrop for social and academic learning and the Second Step 
curriculum provides students with the tool
s they need to grow as citizens and learners.
 
 
The Lincoln staff is composed of fully credentialed classroom teachers who work closely together to provide instruction 
that is developmentally appropriate through a standards
-
based curriculum. An administrato
r, classified employees and 
classroom specialists complete the Lincoln team. The specialist teachers work with students in the areas of physical 
education, music, library, literacy, special education, reading intervention and English Language Development.

Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents are true partners in education at Lincoln School. At the beginning of the school year, a list of activities is posted
 
for which parents sign up. Parents volunteer daily in the library, garden, lunchroom, and classrooms, and on the 
playground. Paren

Committee, Green & Garden Team, district committees, Dads' Club, and the Burlingame Community for Education (BCE). 
Classroom lead parents are assigned to each clas
sroom and assume responsibility for organizing events, providing drivers 
for field trips, helping with the school garden curriculum, and assisting the teachers in the many projects and activities 
that make up the school year. Parents are also a visible par

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
To ensure student safety, Lincoln has a number of programs and activities that teach and reinforce safe, caring, and 
responsible behavior of all students. Three core programs provide the basic foundation for this:  1) Responsive Classroom 
provides daily st

adopted social emotional learning curriculum, provides students with the tools and experiences necessary to ensure their 
social and emotional growth 
keeps pace with their academic growth, 3) The Big 5 Safety protocol, which is adopted by 
both district, city and county entities.
 
 
Our disaster plan is updated annually in the fall. The safety plan is shared with parents through School Site Council and 
wit
h staff at a monthly staff meeting. We hold monthly fire as well as all Big Five Safety Drills. All visitors must sign in and
 
wear badges on campus.

We believe that ongoing professional development is the hallmark of our educational system in Burlingame. Teachers and 
administrators review student achievement data and choose topics relating to the most pressing issues from the previous 
year. The distric
t provides professional development on the Common Core Standards for Literacy for all teachers 
throughout the district in grade level teams. Additionally, there have been several opportunities for NGSS implementation, 
as well as innovative best practices, 
such as Design Thinking and Makerspace learning. The Lincoln staff focus site
-
based 
professional development on Social Emotional Learning (SEL) with district curriculum Second Step, as well as Responsive 
Classroom, promoting positive social interaction and
 
academic learning behaviors. Classroom teachers implement 
strategies which support literacy, math, and Response to Intervention. Faculty meetings include professional development 
activities, and the staff collaborates on a regular basis. Areas of concentr
ation are Design Thinking, SEL, Science and Visual 
and Performing Arts. Staff is also using grade level meetings once a month to focus on data in math and ELA.
