About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned
 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Arlanza Elementary School, built in 1956, is located on 11.5 acreage and its square footage totals 54,429.  The school has 30
 
permanent classrooms, six 
portable classrooms, four sets of restrooms, one computer lab, one

and staff.
 
 
Alvord Uni
fied School District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.  To assist in this effor
t, the district uses a facility 
survey instrument developed by the State of California OPSC.  Results of this survey are available 
in the school office or at the district.  In addition, district 
maintenance staff makes repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order. A district
-
wide work order process is used to ensure 
efficient service and to prioritize repairs.
 
 
The school is cleaned on a regular basis with a day custodian and evening custodians who work with the principal to develop a
 
cleaning schedule to 
maintain a clean and safe environment for all students before, during and after the instructional day.  Def
erred Maintenance projects planned for this 
school year include to 1) landscape/irrigate the southeast portion of the playground, 2) landscape/irrigate between each row 
of classroom buildings in 
four locations, 3) paint the covered wood walkway, exterior d
oors, metal post and fascia trim, and 3) asphalt around the library and empty lot adjacent 
to the kindergarten playground.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarte
r Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible s
tudents 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical
