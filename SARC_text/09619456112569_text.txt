By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Mountain Creek Middle School opened as a new middle school i
n the Pioneer District in September 1994 and is one of 
three campuses in the District. Its opening was the culmination of years of district and community planning. The school is 
located adjacent to Pioneer Elementary School, and shares facilities and perso
nnel in order to efficiently meet the needs 
of both campuses.
 
 
The school prides itself on the care and attention given to the middle school student and the unique needs of this age 
level. Decisions regarding programs offered and efforts at establishing sc
hool climate are guided by the overriding 
assumption that we are responsible for educating the whole child, not merely imparting information in the basic curricular 
areas.
 
 
Core Values
 
The mission of the Pioneer Union School District is best accomplished th
rough the advancement of these core values:
 
1.
 
The uniqueness of the individual
 
2.
 
The partnership among home, school, and community
 
3.
 
A respectful, compassionate, cooperative and safe environment
 
 
Guiding Principles
 
The following principles will guide
 
our work:
 
1.
 
Students will be provided programs, instruction and/or activities designed to enhance the development of positive 
attitudes, patience, tolerance, appreciation of different cultures and productive membership in society.
 
2.
 
Students will be p
rovided programs, instruction, activities and/or guidance to develop mental and moral bravery, 
caring attitudes toward people and education, to gain a healthy view of competition and to learn age appropriate 
skills.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

activities. Annually, there are three full days dedicated to staff 
development augmented by monthly professional learning on early release Fridays and weekly articulation meetings.  The
