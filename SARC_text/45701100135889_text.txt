About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information 
about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports 
for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are 
publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet 
at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first

served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, 
the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending on 
availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation,

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Redding School District makes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. In 2016 the Distr
ict and the Board of Trustees 
authorized a Facilities Needs Assessment in order to identify our facilities needs over the next deca
de. To support the assessment effort, in 2018 the 
community passed a $28 million facilities bond to repair, renovate, and modernize all District schools. Since the bond passed
 
in 2018 the District has used 
the Facilities Needs Assessment to plan out the Bo
nd Initiatives.
 
 
In addition to the local bond the District is seeking any State Modernization matching funds on a percentage basis, to assist
 
with the expenditures for 
any major planned modernization work projects.

The District's Grounds and Maintenance 
staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a 
timely manner, while the Operations staff ensures that the schools are kept clean. A work order process through a program cal
led "Akita Box" is 
used to 
ensure efficient service; emergency repairs are given the highest priority. In addition to responding to emergency repairs, t
he maintenance department 

 
 
S
tellar Charter School is housed at the Redding School District's Education Center and currently has nine classrooms, a cerami
cs studio, and a school 
office. A Charter School Implementation Grant funded the construction of a technology lab and a state
-
of
-
th
e
-
art science lab. It also funded the purchase 
of a van to provide transportation for our students who serve as science and history docents. Stellar has a fully equipped pl
ayground, including basketball 
and wallball courts. Student restrooms and the librar
y were remodeled in 2004
-
2005. Two new portables were added in the summer of 2007. Two 
additional portables and a new ceramics studio were added in the summer of 2009.  A 12X40 shade structure was added in Decemb
er 2015.  Perimeter 
security fencing was rai
sed to 6 foot, standard throughout District, in November 2016.  Outdoor hydration stations were added in 2017.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings is available in School Facility Good Repair Status. This report was ca
lled for by the Wil
liams 
legislation of 2004. What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural inte
grity, electrical systems, heating 
and ventilation systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determin
e if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good repair. If 
anything needs to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The
 
guidelines for this 
assessment were written by the Office of Public
 
School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams Legislation. You can look at the six
-
page Facilities Inspection Tool used for the assessment on the OPSC web site.

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

campus.
 
 
Stellar Charter School maintains a safe and friendly campus. Staff and students have develope
d a school atmosphere that is orderly and respectful. We  
encourage students to be responsible citizens. It is a privilege to attend classes at Stellar, and teachers, parents and staf
f work together to ensure a safe

Parents and staf
f work together closely to help students make positive choices. Detentions and suspensions are rare. Commonly used disciplina
ry actions 
include conflict resolution discussions, and individualized behavior plans. Stellar students know what it means to be sa
fe, responsible, and respectful and 
adopt the motto "Kindness is the norm."
