ESSAGE
Vista Fundamental School is one of two alternative ﬁschools of choiceﬂ elementary schools in the 
Simi Valley Unified School District.  The Vista Eagles have a proud tradition of excellence.  Our 
school motto is
 ﬁTogether Everyone Achieves More.ﬂ
  It is important to our staff that we work 
in partnership with parents and that each student™s experience at Vista is rich and memorable.  
We encourage the parents of the Vista community to get to know other parents, communicate 
regularly with your child™s teacher, join PTA, get involved as a volunteer in a classroom or on a 
committee, and embrace all that Vista has to offer you and your child.  It is our goal that Vista 
students are well prepared when they are promoted to middle school.  As a result, Vista students 
often become leaders in both academic and extracurricular areas during their secondary 
school experience.  Vista™s staff strives to prepare our students for educational experiences and 
careers of the 21st century through differentiated instruction support using research based 
techniques including technology. Our staff are GATE trained.  Our focus remains on achievement 
of the California State Standards and continually enhancing our technology on campus.  Vista 
is a STEM focus school, and students engage in weekly learning opportunities in the areas of 
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. In addition, students have the opportunity 
to participate in after school learning opportunities in the arts and STEM. 
Vista is an exceptional learning environment with long lasting traditions 
and exciting new possibilities to support our student population.  As the 
principal, I am proud to be a Vista Eagle and feel privileged to serve the 
students, families, and staff of the Vista Fundamental School community.

The California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress (CAASPP) System 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative 
Assessments (SBAC) for students in the 
general education population, and the 
California Alternate Assessments (CAAs) for 
students with the most significant cognitive 
disabilities.  Only eligible students may 
participate in the administration of the CAAs.  
CAAs items are aligned with alternative 
achievement standards, which are linked 
with the Common Core State Standards 
(CCSS).  CAASPP results are a measure of 
how well students are mastering California™s 
standards in English language arts/literacy 
(ELA) and mathematics, and are given to 
grades three through eight and grade eleven. 
SBAC tests assess student performance in 
ELA/Literacy and mathematics utilizing 
computer-adaptive tests and performance 
tasks, and CAAs test items are aligned with 
alternative achievement standards which 
are linked with the Common Core State 
Standards (CCSS). 
The CAASPP results shown in this report 
include overall results comparing the school, 
district and state scores as well as the school™s 
overall score in each applicable subgroup. 
Results are shown only for subgroups with 
ten students or more taking the exam. For 
those categories that are blank in the tables, 
no students met subgroup criteria. More 
information on CAASPP can be found on 
the California Department of Education™s 
website www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/ca/.
PHYSICAL
 FITNESS
In the spring of each year, Vista Fundamental 
Elementary is required by the state to 
administer a physical fitness test to all students 
in grade five. The physical fitness test measures 
each student™s ability to complete fitness tasks 
in six major areas. Students who either meet or 
exceed the standards in all six fitness areas are 
considered to be in the ﬁhealthy fitness zone.ﬂ 
The chart disclosed in this document reports 
only the percentage in each category, not a 
cumulative total of the results for categories 4 
of 6 and 5 of 6. Comparative district and state 
results can be found at the CDE™s website.

SAFETY
School administration and teaching staff 
place a high priority on providing adequate 
adult supervision on campus before, during, 
and after school. As students arrive on 
campus each morning, campus supervisors 
are strategically assigned to designated 
entrance areas and the playground.  During 
recess and lunch, campus supervisors 
monitor playground activity.  At the end of 
the day when students are dismissed, campus 
supervisors monitor student behavior to 
ensure a safe and orderly departure. 
Vista Fundamental Elementary is a closed 
campus. During school hours, all visitors 
must sign in at the school™s office and wear 
identification badges while on school 
grounds.

The Comprehensive School Site Safety 
Plan was developed for Vista Fundamental 
Elementary in collaboration with local 
agencies and the district office to fulfill 
Senate Bill 187 requirements. Components 
of this plan include child abuse reporting 
procedures, teacher notification of 
dangerous pupil procedures, disaster 
response procedures, procedures for safe 
arrival and departure from school, sexual 
harassment policy, and dress code policy. 
The school™s most recent school safety plan 
was reviewed, updated, and discussed with 
school staff in October 2019.
SCHOOL
 INSPECTIONS
On an annual basis, schools are required 
by the state to perform a comprehensive 
inspection and report those findings to 
the school community. The most recent 
inspection for Vista Fundamental Elementary 
School took place on September 15, 2019. 
The School Facility Good Repair Status table 
illustrated in this report identifies the state-
required inspection areas and discloses the 
operational status in each of those areas. 
During fiscal year 2019-20, all restrooms 
were fully functional and available for
