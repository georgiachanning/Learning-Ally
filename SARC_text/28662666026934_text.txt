Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-

A 
school
-
wide focus on safety, health and well being has resulted in a campus that is virtually free of violence. We have a 
comprehensive safety plan which was updated on October 24, 2019.  We have monthly fire drills which include 
earthquake, lockdown, and 
teacher illness drills throughout. Occasional graffiti is immediately removed.  Grounds are kept 
litter
-
free and supervised by a full
-
time custodian. Inspections by the Napa Fire Department address code compliance and 
assure that facilities are safe for st

components of SB187 including Student Discipline, Sexual Harassment, and Crisis Response Plan.  The CSSP is reviewed 
annually by the Site Safety Committee that includes sta
ff, parents, and representatives of law enforcement.  Emergency 
equipment has been supplied for each classroom.  Evacuation drills are held monthly.  During the first weeks of school, 
teachers and the administration explain policies about student safety, d
