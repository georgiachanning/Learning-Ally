all

are
 
clean,

This
 
is
 
achieved
 
by
 
custodial
 
staff
 
adhering
 
to
 
district-wide
 
cleaning
 
standards.
  
In
 
addition,
 
a

was
 
developed
 
to
 
make
 
certain
 
that

and
 
that

(School

The
 
Dan
 
O.
 
Root
 
II
 
Health
 
&
 
Wellness
 
Academy
 
staff
 
believes
 
that
 
the
 
involvement
 
with
 
and
 
support
 
of
 
students
 
by
 
their
 
parents
 
is
 
a
 
key
 
factor
 
in
 
student
 
success,
 
thus
 
communication
 
with
 
parents
 
is
 
a
 
collective
 
goal
 
for
 
school.
 
Weekly
 
parent
 
emails,
 
automated
 
phone
 
calls,
 
Twitter
 
updates,
 
and
 
the
 
school
 
website
 
contain
 
information
 
for
 
parents
 
with
 
regards
 
to
 
activities,
 
meetings,
 
and
 
school
 
events,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
ways
 
to
 
support
 
their
 
children
 
in
 
meeting
 
the
 
challenges
 
of
 
today's
 
education.
 
Teachers
 
also
 
send
 
monthly
 
newsletters
 
and
 
daily
 
Class
 
DoJo
 
messages
 
detailing
 
in-class
 
activities.
 
At
 
the
 
front
 
of
 
the
 
school
 
is
 
a
 
sign
 
that
 
is
 
used
 
to
 
signal
 
important
 
information
 
to
 
the
 
community.
 
A
 
phone
 
message,
 
e-mail
 
and
 
Dojo
 
from
 
the
 
principal
 
is
 
sent
 
home
 
every
 
Sunday
 
with
 
weekly

for

Events
 
and
 
upcoming
 
important
 
information
 
are
 
posted
 
on
 
the
 
school

Parent
 
involvement
 
is
 
encouraged
 
through
 
district-level
 
communication
 
committees,
 
school

parent-teacher
 
groups,
 
in-school
 
volunteer
 
programs
 
and
 
monthly
 
"Coffee

gatherings.
 
Teachers
 
are
 
encouraged
 
to
 
hold
 
"Get
 
Acquainted
 
Conferences"
 
at
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
the
 
year.
 
Two-way
 
communication
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
ensure
 
student
 
success.
 
All
 
grade
 
levels
 
implement
 
the
 
Thursday
 
Folder
 
system
 
to
 
provide
 
communication.
 
Students
 
(4th-8th
 
grade)
 
utilize
 
the
 
agenda/planner,
 
which
 
allows
 
parents
 
and
 
teachers
 
to
 
communicate
 
daily.
 
Parents
 
may
 
contact
 
teachers
 
via
 
email
 
at
 
anytime.
 
Parental
 
involvement
 
is
 
highly

The
 
Fairfield-Suisun

requires
 
safety
 
plans
 
for
 
each
 
school:
 
BP/AR

Comprehensive

BP3515,
 
Campus
 
Security;
 
BP/AR
 
3515.2,
 
Disruptions;
 
and
 
BP/AR
 
3516,
 
Disaster
 
Regulations.
 
The
 
Governing
 
Board
 
insists
 
that
 
students
 
and
 
staff
 
have
 
the
 
right
 
to
 
a
 
safe
 
and
 
secure
 
campus
 
where
 
they
 
are
 
free
 
from
 
physical
 
and
 
psychological
 
harm.
 
The
 
Board
 
is
 
fully
 
committed
 
to
 
maximizing
 
school
 
safety
 
and
 
to
 
creating
 
a
 
positive
 
learning
 
environment
 
that
 
teaches
 
violence
 
prevention
 
and
 
emphasizes
 
high
 
expectations
 
for
 
student
 
achievement,
 
responsible
 
behavior
 
and
 
respect
 
for
 
others.
 
Each
 
school
 
site
 
develops
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
school
 
wide
 
safety
 
plan
 
that
 
includes
 
violence
 
prevention
 
strategies
 
and
 
actions
 
to
 
be
 
taken
 
in
 
the
 
event
 
of
 
a
 
crisis.
 
Each
 
plan
 
is
 
tailored
 
to
 
the
 
specific
 
conditions
 
at
 
the
 
school.
 
Each
 
school
 
plan
 
takes
 
into
 
account
 
the
 
expertise,
 
available
 
resources
 
and
 
building
 
design,
 
along
 
with
 
factors
 
unique
 
to
 
each
 
site.
 
A
 
copy
 
of
 
the
 
school's
 
plan
 
is
 
available
 
at
 
the
 
school.
 
The
 
plan
 
is
 
updated
 
and
 
reviewed
 
at
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
each
 
school
 
year
 
by
 
the
 
principal
 
with
 
the
 
complete
 
faculty.
 
The
 
School
 
Safety

was
 
reviewed
 
on
 
December
 
11,
 
2018
 
for
 
the
 
2019-2020
 
school
 
year.
 
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plans
 
include
 
the
 
following
 
elements:
 
a
 
positive
 
school
 
climate
 
promoting
 
respect
 
for
 
diversity,
 
personal
 
and
 
social
 
responsibility,
 
effective
 
interpersonal
 
and
 
communication
 
skills,
 
anger
 
management
 
and
 
conflict
 
resolution;
 
disciplinary
 
policies
 
and
 
procedures;
 
prevention
 
of
 
and
 
alternatives
 
to
 
violence;
 
parent

strategies;

and

strategies
 
related
 
to
 
the
 
sale
 
or

of
 
alcohol
 
and

assessment
 
of
 
the

of
