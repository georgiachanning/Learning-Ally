By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school us
es 
the Facility Inspection Tool
 
(FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that e
mergency repairs are given the highest priority. The school personnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achi
evement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entranc
e to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Family Involvement is 
very important at Ellerhorst Elementary School. Families volunteer in the classrooms on a daily 
basis, helping teachers with small group instruction and classroom activities. They accompany teachers and students to 
the library, assist in the computer lab, 
and drive and chaperone students on study trips. In addition, a number of alumni 
parents whose students have already promoted from Ellerhorst continue to return and volunteer in classrooms, as yard 
supervisors and in the office.
 
 

orst has a very active Parent Teacher Association (PTA) and an affiliated Dad's Club. Together 
these groups have over 200 members. Both groups meet monthly to plan and implement an array of school and family 
activities, both to fundraise and to build commu
nity. Their first activity of the year is to facilitate the sign
-
ups for classroom 
support and the various committees. The PTA developed and instituted its own website and an email tree to disseminate

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of the School Site Safety Plan is to provide a unified template for school sites to respond and recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the 
disruption of normal school operations.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan guides a coordinated school staff response to an emergency, disaster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety 
Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over time and those that may occur without warning.
 
 
The objectives of the School Site Safety Plan are as follows:
 
1.
 
Protect the safety and welfare of students, school staff, and 
visitors.
 
2.
 
Provide for a safe and coordinated response to emergencies.
 
3.
 

 
4.
 
Enable the District to restore normal conditions with minimal confusion in the shortest time possible.
 
5.
 
Provide for the interface and coo
rdination between sites and the District Emergency Operations Center (DEOC).
 
6.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between the District EOC and the Cities of Richmond, El Cerrito, San 
Pablo, Pinole, Hercules, and Contra Costa County Emergency Operatio
ns Center (EOC).
 
7.
 
Provide for the orderly conversion of pre
-
designated District sites to mass care sites, when necessary.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is updated annually.  Our school safety plan was last annually reviewed, updated, 
and discussed w
ith school faculty and a student representative in January 2020.  A copy of the Comprehensive School

The Ellerhorst staff engages in staff workshops, grade level collaboration, and attends outside training on a regular 
basis. 
In this past year, every teacher participated in two full
-
day trainings, as well as additional hours for the introduction of our 
new English Language Arts curriculum of Units of Study from Teachers College. Additionally, for the last few years, the 
staff is focused on the district's other major areas of focus in Mathematics and English Language Development. These 
goals align with our LCAP plan and the Common Core State Standards. Professional Development activities are planned by 
the school site's In
structional Leadership Team in collaboration with the district Teaching, Learning, and Leading (TTL) 
Department. In addition, teacher passion is driving changes in the social studies and science curricula; the staff continues 
to honor the use of academic d
ata to inform instruction and provides effective support for students who are preparing to 
take the Common Core
-
aligned state assessment for language arts and math.
 
 
Quality instruction and instructional leadership are at the heart of the district's achiev
ement efforts. To ensure this quality 
and leadership, the TLL Department engages teachers, administrators, and other personnel in ongoing professional 
development focused on improving teaching and learning. Training is provided to principals and other admi
nistrators to 
improve their ability to provide strong instructional leadership and guide teaching and learning at school sites. The 
principals, in turn, provide support to teachers through staff conferences, opportunities for collaborative study and 
planni
ng, and individual coaching based on ongoing classroom observations. Teachers and other staff are provided with 
both on and off
-
site professional development in all Common Core
-
based curriculum content areas. Beyond the content 
areas, professional developm
ent is provided in English Language Development, differentiated instruction, and educational 
technology. In addition, training is made available in classroom management and the effective use of assessment data and 
teacher data teams in meeting the needs of
 
all students. A primary goal of the professional development program is 
ensuring that all students are served by skilled, highly
-
qualified teachers and that teachers are supported by strong, 
knowledgeable instructional leaders.
