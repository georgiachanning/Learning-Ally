Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or
 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
pr
incipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
With the assistance of our local bond funds (Measure F and Measure G), Guerne
ville School is in exemplary condition. The 
district has partaken in many recent modernization projects that have had a measurable impact on our overall campus 
safety and energy efficiency.  Most recently, we installed new flooring and cabinetry in our G
-
w
ing classrooms as well as 
a new Science Lab, STEAM Lab and Community Center.  In the last two years we installed a campus
-
wide HVAC system, a 
new fire alarm system, updated classroom interiors, installed two new playgrounds, an outdoor fitness center, repa
ved 
all playground asphalt, employed all new energy efficient lighting, and a solar panel installation system.
 
 
In addition, we have made a number of required ADA improvements throughout the 12
-
acre campus in order to improve 
campus accessibility for all. 
We have begun installing a new security system and upgraded the district's entire 
technological infrastructure and access to technology. We continue to monitor ongoing facility needs, attend safety 
trainings and welcome various campus safety inspection opp
ortunities on an ongoing basis.  We work to reflect upcoming 
capital projects in the District's master facilities plan annually.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC
 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative 
Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participa
te in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students w
ho have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents are always welcome and invited

or with Friends of Guerneville School (F.O.G.S.) our active parent group that coordinates events such as our community 
Halloween Carnival, Harvest Fair, and many other act
ivities.  F.O.G.S. has been instrumental in raising funds for our music 
program, garden program, and many other enrichment opportunities.  We also have School Site Council, another active 
parent group, that meets regularly to offer suggestions and adviseme
nt on our schoolwide plans and LCAP goals. In 
addition to these committees, we also have AVID community nights as well as a Parent Engagement Booth during Parent 
Teacher Conferences and monthly Principal & Parent meetings to dialogue and discuss goals, eve
nts, and activities as well 
as gather parent input on school programs. For more information about Parental Involvement, contact the principal at

Staff members build ongoing teaching skills and concepts by participating in many conferences and workshops throughout 
the year, then sharing their experiences and knowledge with district colleagues. Various considerations, such as staff 
requests, student 
data analysis, parent feedback, stakeholder input, and evidenced
-
based practices are used to determine 
ongoing training.
 
 
Topics for staff development during the last 3 school years have included: social
-
emotional learning Toolbox 
implementation, math less
on study, technology, best practices for serving English Language Learners,  Sustainability, Safe 
School Ambassadors, adaptive software (Lexia, Dreambox, and Acellus) implementation, standards based CCSS reporting, 
data analysis and progress monitoring, st
udent equity, Restorative Practices, BEST Positive Behavior Interventions, and 
Supports through MTSS, AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) and School Emergency Preparedness Training.
