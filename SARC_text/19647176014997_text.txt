School Description
 
 

 
Cresson Elementary School is a neighborhood school nestled in a community that includes single
-
family homes and apartment complexes.  Most of our students either walk to school or are driven 
by their parents each day.  Cresson serves approximately 300 stud
ents from Transitional 
Kindergarten through fifth grade, encompassing a diverse group of learners that includes English 
Learners, Students with Disabilities, and Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) students.  Once they 
complete fifth grade, our students m
ove on to Lake Center Middle School then Santa Fe High 
School.
 
 
Our hard
-
working, dedicated staff includes eleven general education teachers, two Deaf and Hard 
of Hearing teachers, special education support staff, interventionists, classroom 
paraprofessionals, 
office and custodial staff, and the principal.  We enjoy the support of many parent and community 
volunteers who dedicate countless hours to assist our staff in ensuring that our students receive 
the best possible educational experiences
.  Our team works collaboratively during Data Reflection 
Sessions, during staff meetings, on early release Wednesdays, and during professional 
development opportunities.  We collect and analyze data, reflect on student progress, and plan 
instruction using 
research
-
based strategies that address the goals of the new California State 
Standards to ensure that our students are well
-
prepared for their futures in college and careers.  
Our professional development funds (LCAP 7) allow us to offer training that is s
pecifically
-
designed 
to address reading deeply, writing across the curriculum using text evidence, having a deep 
understanding of mathematical concepts in order to apply math skills and strategies in a variety of 
situations, and using technology as a tool 
to learn, create, and demonstrate understanding.   This 
collaborative, data
-
driven approach to instruction resulted in our making gains in both language 
arts and math on the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress.  In addition, 
Cresson w
as named a California Gold Ribbon School and a Title I Academic Achievement School in 
2016, and received the CSBA Golden Bell Award in 2017.  In addition, during the 2018
-
2019 school 
year, Cresson was recognized as a California Business for Education Excel
lence (CBEE) Honor Roll 
School.
 
 
At Cresson, we maintain high expectations for all learners to reach their potential.  We believe this 
includes addressing the needs of the whole child, academically, socially, emotionally, and 
physically. Using our Student 
Motivation (LCAP 33) and district funds (LCAP 26 and 27) we have 
developed a school
-
wide behavior plan aimed at promoting positive character traits and an anti
-
bully program, which are designed to help increase student school connectedness and 
engagement. 
 
In addition to our school programs, we have district and community partnerships 
that include music, art, physical education, technology, counseling, and the THINK Together 
afterschool program.    Our annual Parent Survey results indicate that more than 95
% of our parents 
indicate strong support and satisfaction for the school and the education their children receive. In 
addition, our Healthy Kids Survey results show that more than 93% of our students feel connected 
to and safe in their school.  Our childre
n are our greatest resource and we invest great effort in 
addressing the unique needs of every individual student.

About the SARC
 
By February 1
 
of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Fo
rmula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and lo
cal priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, 
parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Cresson School was built in the early 1950s and is in good condition. During the 1990s, we added eight portable 
classrooms and combined two portables 
to make up our library. Maintenance and improvements included repairing the flooring in one of the portable classrooms during
 
2009. In 2010

2011, 
the school perimeter fencing and signage was replaced. In 2012 a lunch p
atio with a shaded cover was constructed outside our cafeteria which allows 
our children to eat outside when weather permits. In 2013 tables and chairs were added to our outside eating area.
 
 
In 2013
-
2014 exterior lighting was installed throughout the camp
us. Wireless internet was also expanded throughout the entire campus.
 
 
Our two custodians clean each classroom every other day and all restrooms every day. Our custodians clear our campus of litte
r daily, and the district 
maintenance personnel remove any g
raffiti. The district maintains the landscaping on a weekly schedule.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the
 
Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an asse
ssment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical systems, heating and ventilation
 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good
 
repa
ir. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for
 
this assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by th
e Williams legislation. You can look at the six

Tool used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Communication and parent involvement is very important at Cresson Elementa
ry School.  We know the value of a strong home
-
school partnership, and 
we desire to see this relationship grow, for the benefit of our students, families, staff, and the community.  For the 2019
-
2020 school year, our goal is to 
increase our parent involvem
ent, not only in family events, but also in leadership and training opportunities.  We will continue to seek opportunities to
 
share information and gain input from parents.  In addition, we will offer information and training sessions aimed at keeping
 
our 
parents up
-
to
-
date with 
what is happening at Cresson and the district.  This school year we hosted a parent training in Growth Mindset in English and
 
Spanish.  We strive to 
provide translation and babysitting as needed for parent meetings and training.  Th
ese efforts will continue to be supported by our Parental Involvement 
funds (LCAP 28).
 
It is our goal to keep everyone informed and involved through a variety of sources, including the school marquee, classroom n
ewsletters, flyers, School 
Messenger phone c

input, 
questions, or concerns.
 
 
Cresson parents are invited and encouraged to be active participants in the school community. Paren
t leadership opportunities include membership in 
the School Site Council (SSC), English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), and Parent Teacher Organization (PTO).  In addition
, Cresson enjoys the support 
of parents and community members as volunteers in the
 
classroom and in the school office, chaperones on field trips, and support for special programs 
and events, such as Back

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Pla
n
 
Safety is of the utmost importance at Cresson Elementary School.  To ensure safety and security, students enter campus from 7
:45 to 8:15 through a

Cresson staff engages in ongoing professional development in order to effectively meet the needs of all students.  From the f
all of 2014 to spring 2017, 
Cresson participated in training and coaching in the use of CELL/ExLL strategies to support literacy sk
ills across the curriculum in all grade levels.  As part 
of this process, a literacy coach provided professional training sessions, observation and individual coaching sessions. Teac
hers also had opportunities to 
observe peers in other classrooms and other
 
schools.  This site
-
specific professional development and in
-
class coaching were specifically related to 
reading and writing strategies to support students in reading with depth of understanding and writing across the curriculum u
sing text evidence and 
su
pport.  Since the deep understanding and application of text continues to be of particular focus, Cresson has continued to en
gage in professional 
development regarding Close Reading, through district TOSA training and support and through our Student Achiev
ement Leadership Team (SALT) 
collaboration.  Teachers now routinely engage in grade level and vertical articulation and collaboration facilitated by our d
istrict curriculum coaches.
 
 
Staff development continues to focus on California State Standards and ho
w to address them with high levels of rigorous learning and student 
engagement.  In addition to participating in district professional development related to math teaching and learning through 
partnership with Math 
Solutions, we continue to work with distr
ict coaches to ensure that our teaching and learning challenge and enrich our students so that they can meet 
state standards and their own personal goals.  During the 2019
-
2020 school year, the district math coaches are working with a group of teachers fro
m 

, assessments, and 
expectations of rigor.  Site Professional Development funds (LCAP 7) have allowed Cresson to address specific 
site training and collaboration needs in 
order to best meet the needs of all students.  Our staff participated in professional development in the new ELD standards an
d assessments.  All staff 
participated in training provided through a district and UCLA co
llaboration in the Next Generation Science Standards and continued math professional 
development by grade level.  In addition, a team of teachers engaged in training to become Thinking Maps trainers in order to
 
provide support for the 
schoolwide implementa

nd are using 
them to organize and communicate information and learning.

On Tuesdays, during Data Reflection Sessions, grade level 
teams continue to analyze student work and assessment data and collaboratively plan 
instruction, focusing on the diverse needs of all of our student subgroups, including GATE, English Learners, and Students wi
th Disabilities.  The Cresson 
staff is dedicate
d to the learning and growth that needs to occur on their part so that they are well
-
equipped to provide appropriate instruction to all of 
our students.  SALT facilitated the creation and implementation of a School Instruction Plan to address specific stud
ent learning targets within and across 
grade levels.  This team looks at data, engages in professional development, and facilitates staff collaboration and learning
 
in order to strategically focus 
on identified student learning goals.  Cresson's SALT conti
nues to provide instructional leadership from the middle to support all staff in deep, meaningful 
conversations and planning to raise the level of rigor and student engagement across all curricular areas.  As this team beco
mes increasingly empowered, 
stude
nts and staff benefit from increased achievement and habits of lifelong learning.

y.  At the middle schools, 
Interventionists monitor student academic pro
gress and determine placement for intervention based on student needs.  Title I funds are also used to 
support parent involvement at both the site and district level.  Title III is used to provide supplemental services to all En
glish Learners including add
itional 
tutoring beyond the school day, and professional development for EL Coordinators.  Title IV funds provide students with a wel

these funds support safe and healthy students 
through the implementation of a social emotional learning program, Second Step, which is a proactive approach to building ess
ential social and behavioral 
skills.  LCAP Funds are used to supplement services for 
English learners, low income students, and homeless/foster students.  Some actions and services
