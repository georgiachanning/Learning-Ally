By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Albany's schools are the focal point of its community. Families choose to locate here because of 
the schools. Ocean View 
Elementary School is a unique school with a community, rich in economic, ethnic and racial diversity. Our teachers and 
staff have a commitment to high expectations through a dynamic blend of collaboration, professionalism, and a ded
ication 
to a rigorous, state standards
-
aligned curriculum targeted to address the needs of all students.
 
 
Ocean View School is one of three elementary schools and the first to be rebuilt in over 40 years serving kindergarten to 
fifth
-
grade from early child
hood to early adolescence. Ocean View School is scheduled to be in temporary housing for 2 
years during the reconstruction of our new school.  Relocating and housing 430 students within Albany is only 
accomplished with the effort of an entire district comm
unity.  Using current district facilities, Kindergarten has been 
relocated at Marin and Cornell schools.  Grades 1 and 2 are located in the new Albany Middle School Annex with grades, 
3, 4, and 5 relocating to the new wing of Albany High School in the earl
y spring of 2020. Moving and living within the other 
school communities is a challenge and adventure the Ocean View community embrace. Being good neighbors while 
maintaining a safe and welcoming learning environment is the mission of teachers and staff whi
le in temporary housing.
 
 
The Ocean View parent community is largely college
-
educated, economically diverse, and socially active. There is no single 
majority racial
-
ethnic group in Albany schools. We are approximately 41% white, 42% Asian
-
Pacific Islander,
 
7% African 
American and of these racial
-
ethnic groups, 20% also identify as Hispanic or Latino. 40% of Ocean View students are 
identified as speaking a language other than English at home. This offers our students and community with a rich multi
-
cultural 
foundation on which to build a deep appreciation for our diversity.
 
35% of Ocean View students participate in the 
Federal Free or Reduced Lunch Program.
 
 
Ocean View School accommodates 17 general education classrooms, while Cornell and Marin care for four 
of Ocean View's 
kindergarten classes. Temporary locations both at the middle and high school support an ELD
-
reading lab, outdoor PE 
facilities, science lab, special education staff, and aftercare. The general education classrooms have an average student to
 
teacher ratio of 24: 1 in Kindergarten through 3rd grade and 28:1 for 4
-
5th grade. Additionally, we have highly qualified 
teachers with both multi subject and single subject credentials in early childhood education, Physical Education, Music, 
Science, and
 
Media/Library. Ocean View Elementary has a support staff composed of 1.4 FTE Intervention Specialists, 2.2 
FTE English Language Development Specialist Teachers, 1.0 FTE Speech and Language Specialist, a part
-
time Psychologist, 
1.0 FTE Resource Teacher, .4
 
FTE Occupational Therapist, and two part
-
time counseling interns. Classrooms for 1st through 
5th grade are equipped with smart boards and short
-
throw projectors, student laptops, iPads, and an amplification system 
providing voice and language enhancement 
with all instruction.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
A Facilities Master Plan was 
approved in 2014. Plans are in progress to utilize Bond Measures B & E approved by Albany 
voters in June 2016. In general, our district needs to prepare for anticipated growth in enrollment and the addition and/or 
replacement of existing facilities. Over t
he coming year, we will determine when to schedule the Ocean View Elementary 
School Project and how to address temporarily housing students off campus. The safety of students and staff is a primary 
concern at Ocean View Elementary School. The school site s
afety plan is updated annually. The key element of the school 
site safety plan encompasses student safety and evacuation procedures. Fire, earthquake and lockdown drills are 
conducted on a regular basis. To ensure student safety, staff members supervise st
udents at all times during the school 

office.

The school was built in 1975 and modernized in 2000. There are 27 classrooms, a multi
purpose room/stage, a library 
multimedia center, special day class and resource specialist program classrooms, two English language development (ELD) 
classrooms and a counseling office. We are located near Ocean View Park. With the cooperation of the City 
of Albany, 
Ocean View Park offers students many opportunities for play and various field games. District maintenance staff ensures 
the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair, and other work orders, are completed in a timely manner. A 
workorder
 
process is used to ensure efficient service and the highest priority to emergency repairs. We have two 
custodians: one lead day custodian and one night custodian Monday through Friday. The principal works with custodial 
staff members to ensure the cleanin
g of the school is maintained to provide a clean and safe school

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the
 
State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education populat
ion and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are alig
ned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the r
equirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We value and enjoy a growing 
level of parent and community involvement at Ocean View School. This partnership 
between the school and Ocean View families, allows us to effectively support our students, staff, and instructional 
programs. Parent involvement is valued during our period of
 
rebuilding. Parents can participate in any of the following 
parent organizations: English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), the Ocean View PTA, and the Black Parent Advisory 
Group as well as volunteering in classrooms, field trips, and lunchtime supervis
ion. The Ocean View PTA organizes parent 
education nights, community fundraising events and is instrumental in helping build a strong parent
-
teacher community.  
PTA fundraising supports school programs such as arts enrichment, field trips, and temporary ho
using projects such as 
gardening and playground enhancement. Our school community benefits greatly from the support and assistance 
provided by our PTA and community volunteers. Please contact the school at 558

Ocean View staff development is aligned to district goals: We will provide comprehensive educational experiences with 
expanded opportunities for demonstrating and assessing 
student growth.
 
 
Each year we strive to serve the individual, social, emotional, and academic needs of our students and apply appropriate 
interventions through a collaborative approach. We work to empower the leadership capacity of our teachers and staff 
w
hile working to communicate with stakeholders to make decisions, communicate and assess the site and district goals.
 
 
This year elementary professional development opportunities include both training in the History
-
Social Science California 
content standar
ds and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Other areas of current interest for training include 
topics of Social Justice and Social
-
Emotional Learning.  Teachers also provide input for the three district
-
wide professional 
development days through
out the year.  In addition, staff meetings are held each Wednesday afternoon; these meetings 
offer teachers the opportunity to collaborate regarding curriculum, instruction, and assessments. In addition, our 
instructional leadership team of teachers meets 
bi
-
monthly as a standing committee and decision
-
making group.  These 
leaders guide us through the effort to improve student learning by narrowing the achievement gap by improving and 
enhancing instructional practices. Ocean View teachers also work closely 
with Cornell and Marin schools to align our 
instruction throughout the district. We are committed to the ongoing collaboration to always improve our instructional 
practices of state standards and better prepare students for the Smarter Balanced Assessments
.
