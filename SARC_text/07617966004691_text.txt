Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school us
es 
the Facility Inspection Tool 
(FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that em
ergency repairs are given the highest priority. The school personnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education populati
on and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the re
quirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The School Site Safe
ty Plan guides a coordinated school staff response to an emergency, disaster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents th
at may develop over time and those that may occur without warning.
 
 
The objectives of the School Site Safety Plan are as follows:
 
1.
 
Protect the safety and welfare of students, school staff, and visitors.
 
2.
 
Provide for a safe and coordinated response to e
mergencies.
 
3.
 

 
4.
 
Enable the District to restore normal conditions with minimal confusion in the shortest time possible.
 
5.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between sites and the District Emergency Operati
ons Center (DEOC).
 
6.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between the District EOC and the Cities of Richmond, El Cerrito, San 
Pablo, Pinole, Hercules, and Contra Costa County Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
 
7.
 
Provide for the orderly conversion of pre
-
designated District sites to mass care sites, when necessary.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is updated annually.  Our school safety plan was last annually reviewed, updated, 
and discussed with school faculty and a student representative in January
 
2020.  A copy of the Comprehensive School

At Dover, teachers have many opportunities for professional development. An Instructional Leadership Team (ILT) 
comprised of a teacher from each grade level, our Curriculum Coach, the Academic Subcommittee Representative, our 
Vice Principal, and Principal.
 
The ILT meets once a month for 1 hour. As the leadership team, we discuss and determine 
the direction the school takes when focusing on academics, school climate and other areas of need. Professional 
Development consists of academic
-
focused areas such as 
Teachers College Writing Project for writing and English 
Language Development support for teachers. Teachers are encouraged to follow their passions with their professional 
development. Dover offers a nutrition course taught by a resident teacher that is o
pen to teachers who want to teach 
nutrition in their classrooms. Other development opportunities include social
-
emotional learning offered in restorative 
justice practices and mindfulness. Teachers are also encouraged to take professional time to observe o
ther teachers who 
are successful in areas where they would like to grow.
 
 
Teachers are not the only staff members with access to professional development. Administration attends training in the 
same vein as teachers so that they are better equipped to be t
he instructional leaders of the school. Our other support 
staff including speech therapists, counselors, school psychologists, occupational therapists also receive a litany of trainin
g 
in areas that are appropriate to their expertise.
 
 
In all professional 
development is determined and offered based on the needs of our students. It can be given by a teacher, 
the principal, the district or and outside partner. However we receive it, it is always with the goal of a better education f
or 
our students in mind.
