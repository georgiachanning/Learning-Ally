School Description
 
Center Street School is a richly diverse community of learners that values the contributions of all 
its members. In an environment of teamwork, caring, trust, and respect, we provide the highest 
quality education. Our aim is to empower s
tudents to be creative problem solvers who have all of 
the skills necessary to be confident contributors to the local and global community. We promote 
visionary, versatile thinking and enthusiastic, lifelong learning. We appreciate the uniqueness of 
each s
tudent and set high expectations for all. Center Street School fosters a strong partnership 
with parents, community members and businesses to ensure that every student confidently 
possesses the learning skills necessary to become a contributing, successful
 
and compassionate 
global citizen and leader.
 
 
Center Street School is located in the small coastal community of El Segundo, which is home to over 
16,000 residents. The Pacific Ocean, LAX Airport, Chevron Oil Refinery, and large corporate business 
centers 
border the city. This unique position creates a small hometown atmosphere with a strong 
sense of community amidst a larger, metropolitan area hosting multinational entities. The small 
town feel and accessibility to the world at large make the El Segundo co
mmunity take special pride 
in its schools and the community truly exemplifies the saying, "It takes a village to raise a child." 
Center Street School was named a California Green Ribbon School in 2018, received the California 
Gold Ribbon School award in 20
16, and has been recognized as a California Distinguished School in 
1998, 2002 and 2008. It has also received the Golden Bell Award and has been acknowledged by 
the California Business for Academic Excellence (CBEE).
 
 
The school's ability to sustain excell
ence is due to its fully credentialed staff, continuous 
professional development and a commitment to address each child's individual academic needs. 
Center Street School offers an outstanding reading program that teaches each student at his or her 
individu
al reading level and captures his or her interest with a collection of more than 25,000 books. 
A fully credentialed music teacher works with all students weekly and all K
-
5th grade students 
participate in Project Lead the Way, an engineering curriculum tau
ght weekly by a credentialed 
teacher. All students utilize our educational garden in conjunction with our Growing Great program 
to focus on health and nutrition.
 
 
Center Street School is one of two elementary schools in the El Segundo Unified School Distri
ct, 
both with classes arranged on a traditional schedule. 775 Transitional Kindergarten through fifth 
grade students were enrolled at the beginning of the 2018
-
19 school year. Center Street School 
boasts an extremely active PTA  and every day parent volunt
eers engage actively in classrooms 
across campus, adding a layer of richness and experience to the already rigorous curriculum.

For the 2018
-
19 school year, the 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement focuses on five goals aligned with the district's Local 
Control Accountabi
lity Plan with a primary focus on continued 
implementation of the California Common Core Standards to best 
prepare all students for college and career readiness. Through 
rigorous instruction, high expectations, and opportunities for 
problem solving, our go
al is to develop learners that can utilize 
their critical thinking and creativity in all contexts. Through our 
professional learning community,  grade level teams analyze 
student data to drive instruction and intervention, which will close 
the achievement 
gap for identified unduplicated students. Through 
differentiation, small group instruction, and personalized learning, 
our goal is to establish a safe and engaging campus that meets the 
needs of all learners. The plan seeks to create a more targeted 
interv
ention and response
-
to
-
intervention program, specifically 
targeting English Learners and economically disadvantaged 
students. Benchmark progress indicators for The 
School Plan
 
for 
Student Achievement include the Scholastic Reading Inventory 
assessment, int
erim CAASPP assessments in English Language Arts 
and Math, and teacher
-
developed curriculum
-
based assessments 
reviewed at Professional Learning Community meetings. To 
improve school climate and increase parent involvement, the plan 
offers several initiativ
es to promote intercultural understanding 
and to augment opportunities for parent involvement. The 
Professional Development goals focus on meeting the needs of 
subgroups, including English Language Learners, students with 
disabilities, differentiating inst
ruction, and  technology integration.  
The School Site Council regularly reviews goals and progress, and 
staff regularly analyzes student data at dedicated Professional 
Learning Community and Professional Development meetings.
 
 
Professional 
Development continues to focus on increasing teacher 
efficacy through the analysis of student data to design instruction 
that supports all learners in achieving mastery of California 
Standards. Additionally, teachers continue to build their capacity in 
the
 
use of Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI) for math, Readers 
and Writers Workshop, and Next Generation Science Standards to 
personalize the learning experience to challenge and support all 
learners.
 
 
School Mission
 
At  Center Street School, we value and 
care for each and every 
student. Within a safe and compassionate learning environment, 
students take ownership in their role as scholars and are 
empowered to achieve at their highest level. Through creativity, 
collaboration, and critical thinking, children
 
enjoy the process of 
becoming problem solvers and lifelong learners.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California pu
blic school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, w
ith specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC 
web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Every student has access to all of our textbooks and instructional materials. We as a district work together to develop teams
, consisting of several 
representatives from each school site, prior to adoption of new curriculum. We in
vite representatives out to share about their materials and have 
teachers volunteer to pilot new programs. All of our instructional materials and curriculum come from the state adopted list 
and are current with the 
cycles presented from the state. The 2014

Parents and the community are very supportive of the educational programs in the El Segundo Unified School District. Parents 
are visible in the classrooms 
and workroom on a daily basis. The School Site Council and
 
PTA are both very active, supporting classroom instruction and special grade level and school
-
wide events.  The school has benefited from the fund
-
raising efforts and allocation of funding from both groups, which have provided major 
improvements to the ca
mpus including new playgrounds, sponsorship of assemblies and field trips and the purchase and maintenance of technology for 
classroom use. Our English Learners Advisory Council (ELAC) meets during the school year and members participate in the evalu
ation 
and development 
of the district Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP).The business community in El Segundo is also very supportive of our 
schools, and in 1983, the El 
Segundo Ed! Foundation was founded to raise supplemental funding for all schools. Scho
ol staff facilitate parent education nights focusing on topics 
relevant to parents of young children, including CGI Math, helping with homework and internet safety. In addition, CSS hosts 
a list of family nights, 
including: STEM family night, Literacy Nigh
t, Family Wellness Night. Art Night and Story Pirates Family Night. Additional community partners providing 
support to Center Street Elementary School include, but are not limited to: Kiwanis, Mattel, Chevron, Direct TV, El Segundo C
hamber of Commerce, and
 
Rotary Club.

campus must sign in at the office and display a visitors pass at all times. The School Site Safety Plan is evaluated and revi
sed annually each summer by 
administrators, the El Segundo
 
Fire Department, and members of the Parent Teacher Association; the revisions are then shared with the entire staff. Key 
elements to the safety plan include evacuation plans and drills, shelter

place and dismissal procedures, location and rationing of 
first aide supplies, 
and implementation of the SEMS (Standardized Emergency Management System) Model. The school is in compliance with the laws, r

The El Segundo Unified School District has a long history of providing support for teachers to participate in professional de
velopment activities. Through 
attendance at workshops and conferences, the staff at Center Street School has developed a common lan
guage and vision that defines the school 
community. The school uses Achievement Team Meetings to review student work, discuss individual growth and apply the most eff
ective evidence based 
strategies.  Teachers are empowered in all elements of site based de
cisions from curriculum and instruction, to program assessment, to school policies 
and discipline procedures. For the past three years, the District has sponsored three staff development days annually, where 
teachers are offered a 
variety of growth opportu
nities. In addition, each Monday is a minimum day. This time is dedicated to staff meetings, grade level/department meetings,
 
and professional development. Topics include but are not limited to: Readers and Writers Workshop, Cognitive Guided Instructi
on, N
ext Generation 
Science Standards, Technology, and differentiated instructional strategies. Recently credentialed teachers are provided addit
ional assistance through the 
Beginning Teacher Support and Assistance Program (BTSA).

The California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1, 
2018, regarding how to calculate school
-
level per
-
pupil expenditures that will be 
reported on 2018
-
19 report cards.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 

l districts receive money 
from the state. Previously school districts received a significant portion of money without restrictions,
 
but much of the funding was restricted to specific 
programs, called categorical programs. Some examples of these categorical programs included textbook funds and the Regional O
ccupation Program for 
high school students. There were dozens of state categori
cal programs that were eliminated when the LCFF went into effect in July 2013.
 
 

trate how funds will be used 
to address eight prior
ities established by the state, school districts must develop and approve a Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) no later
 
than 
July 1 of each year. This three
-
year plan is to be updated annually. Once approved by the Board of Education, the LCAP will b
e the basis for expenditures 
in the District.
 
 
The eight priorities that El Segundo Unified School District will include in the LCAP include the following:
 

 
Student Achievement
 

 
Student Engagement
 

 
Other Student Outcomes
 

 
School Climate
 

 
Parental Involvement
 

 
Ba
sic Services
 

 
Implementation of the Common Core Standards
 

 
Course Access
 
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that pr
ovides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enr
ollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Lib
rary). Access to the Internet at 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length 
of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availabili
ty), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print 
documents.
