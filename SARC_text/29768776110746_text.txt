School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-
20
 
 
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Williams Ranch School, established in 1992, is located in Western Nevada County and serves K
-
5 students.  The semi
-
rural 
setting of the school supports the pervasive caring community culture of the school.  All students ar
e valued as unique 
learners, with support systems and enrichment opportunities tailored to meet their needs.  Standards
-
based instruction 
and a strongly committed teaching staff combined with a focus on student learning contribute to this high
-
quality 
educ
ational environment.  During the 2019/2020 school year, the District fully implemented Universal Access which we 
titled ME Time (Meaningful Enrichment).  This dedicated block of time is intended to meet the individual students' 
academic and social
-
emotiona
l needs within mixed grade level groupings.  The dedication and commitment of all District 
staff has earned the highly sought after Golden Bell Award.
 
 
School Vision:  The Penn Valley Union Elementary School District inspires a passion for learning and pro
motes engagement 
and belonging while maximizing the potential of every member of our school community.
 
 
School Mission Statement:  To understand each child and promote individual success, we will build relationships with 
knowledge, enthusiasm, and patience
.  By advocating, encouraging, and modeling with compassion and respect for our 
students, they will learn that life
-
long growth and change are achievable through hard work and perseverance.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or 
career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents play a very important role at Williams Ranch School through their active participation and involvement
 
in School Site Council, Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), various annual events, advisory committees, and by regularly 
volunteering
 
their servic
es in the classrooms. Parents are considered a vital link in the success of our children and our
 
school. Through these organizations and our Roots and Wings Educational Foundation, parents and
 
community members 
help shape curriculum and policies, in additi
on, funding special projects to purchasing equipment and
 
supplies to benefit 
our students. All take a supportive, active, and collaborative role in every aspect of our
 
school. The school's website links 
to a parent page and school and PTO Facebook pages gi
ving parents access to current information about
 
activities and 
meetings. We also have principal chats inviting the parents and community to come and
 
talk about topics of interest.
