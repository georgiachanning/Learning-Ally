About the SARC
 
By February 
1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding F
ormula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and l
ocal priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school,
 
parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Most of the school's repairs and maintenan
ce projects are 
performed by the 

ol custodian 
or district maintenance staff, based upon the nature of the situation. Day and evening custodians work closely as a te
am and with the principal for routine 
maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events preparations. The principal and day custodian communicate daily to di
scuss campus cleaning 
needs and safety concerns. Every morning before school begins, the cust
odian, principal, and assistant principal inspect facilities for safety hazards, 
graffiti, and other conditions that require removal prior to students and staff entering school grounds. School safety and cl

re in keeping facilities 
well stocked, safe, and sanitary. The evening custodians are responsible for thorough cle

Groundskeepers are dispatched by the district office to perform general maintenance of landscaping, gardening, sports fields,

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
-
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
-
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is 
not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated
 
using only students who received scores.
