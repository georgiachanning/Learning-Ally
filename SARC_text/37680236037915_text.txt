About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Ca
lifornia is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educationa
l agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, dat
a reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.
gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community m
embers should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Research shows a high correlation between parent involvement and effective schools.  We enc
ourage parents to visit our school and become actively 
involved; multiple and varied opportunities are provided every week.  We host monthly parent meetings with the principal to k
eep parents informed 
about the state standards, the new assessments, latest 
curriculum, supports for English language learners, and instructional best practices.  Parents are 
seen as allies and are offered a variety of opportunities to become partners with us in the education of their children. Pare
nts are invited to visit 
classro
oms and do walkthroughs with the Principal. There are on
-
going parent workshops with various organizations throughout the year to support 
parenting skills. There is a mobile clinic at our school every other Monday to increase wrap
-
around services for all p
arents and the community.
 
 
Every Friday the principal hosts parent meetings. The first Friday of every month is Coffee with the Principal. Coffee with t
he Principal provides 
information to parents about resources available in the community. The second Frid
ay of the month, is the Parent
-
Teacher
-
Organization (PTO). With 
PTO, school
-
wide events are planned, organized for all students. PTO is a collaborative body of parents working towards a common purpose 
of supporting 
all students TK
-
6th grade. The third Frid
ay of each month is dedicated to the English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC). During ELAC information 
regarding data on our English language Learners, resources, and information on best instructional strategies are delivered to
 
parents to best support 
t
heir children at home.
 
 
Parents elect parent representatives to serve on the School Site Council, the English Language Advisory Committee, and the Pa
rent
-
Teacher Organization 
(PTO).  Our parents are always very supportive of school programs and have partic
