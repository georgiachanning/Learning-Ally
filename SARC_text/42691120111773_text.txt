(FP
 
Charter)
 
Opened
 
In
 
Solvang,
 
during
 
the
 
summer
 
of
 
2006,
 
a
 
group
 
of
 
education
 
innovators
 
led
 
by
 
Tom
 
Goodman,
 
were
 
persuaded
 
to
 
write
 
a
 
charter
 
petition
 
for
 
a
 
new
 
independent
 
study
 
charter
 
school.
 
Together
 
they
 
worked
 
with
 
experienced
 
charter
 
school
 
administrative
 
assistant,
 
Suzanne
 
Clark,
  
to
 
plan,
 
organize
 
and
 
develop
 
a
 
school
 
dedicated
 
to
 
providing
 
a
 
learning
 
environment
 
in
 
which
 
students
 
and
 
their
 
teachers
 
could
 
develop
 
the
 
kind
 
of
 
one
 
on
 
one
 
relationships
 
that
 
promote
 
deeper
 
learning
 
and
 
motivated
 
students.
 
The
 
school
 
is
 
authorized
 
by
 
the
 
Blochman
 
Union
 
School
 
District
 
and
 
provides
 
services
 
in
 
Santa
 
Barbara
 
and
 
San
 
Luis
 
Obispo
 
counties.
 
FP
 
Charter
 
serves
 
students
 
and
 
families
 
in
 
grades
 
K-12
 
who
 
are
 
seeking
 
alternative,
 
personalized
 
educational
 
programs.
 
 
FP
 
Charter
 
is
 
a
 
WASC
 
Accredited,
 
direct-funded,
 
Blended/Independent
 
Study
 
Charter
 
School.
 
FP
 
Charter
 
serves
 
students
 
that
 
reside
 
in
 
Santa
 
Barbara
 
and
 
San
 
Luis
 
Obispo
 
Counties
 
using
 
a
 
personalized
 
approach
 
to
 
learning.
 
 
FP
 
Charter
 
programs
 
offer
 
non-classroom
 
based
 
instruction
 
through
 
learning
 
centers
 
that
 
focus
 
on
 
Personalized
 
Learning,
 
Blended
 
Learning,
 
Independent,
 
and
 
Montessori
 
Teachings.
 
Through
 
all
 
programs,
 
a
 
partnership
 
between
 
the
 
school,
 
teacher,
 
parent,
 
and
 
student
 
is
 
built
 
to
 
support
 
student
 
learning.
 
 
FP
 
Charter
 
is
 
a
 
public
 
school
 
and
 
has
 
to
 
follow
 
the
 
same
 
State
 
Laws
 
as
 
a
 
traditional
 
public
 
school.
 
However,
 
public
 
charter
 
schools
 
are
 
structured
 
differently
 
than
 
traditional
 
public
 
schools.
 
The
 
primary
 
goal
 
of
 
our
 
charter
 
school
 
is
 
to
 
maximize
 
personalized
 
learning
 
opportunities
 
for
 
students
 
to
 
guarantee
 
our
 
students
 
can
 
master
 
the
 
necessary
 
skills
 
to
 
succeed.
 
FP
 
Charter
 
allows
 
for
 
wide
 
differences
 
in
 
student
 
learning
 
styles,
 
abilities,
 
and
 
interests.
 
Unlike
 
a
 
traditional
 
public
 
school,
 
in
 
partnership
 
with
 
parents
 
FP
 
Charter
 
personalizes
 
the
 
learning
 
environment
 
to
 
meet
 
the
 
individual
 
needs
 
of
 
the
 
student.
 
 
Family
 
Partnership
 
Charter
 
School
 
Mission
 
Statement:
 
 
Provide
 
a
 
personalized
 
and
 
nurturing
 
learning
 
environment
 
focused
 
on
 
inspiring
 
lifelong
 
learners.

(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
FPCS
 
is
 
a
 
non-classroom
 
based
 
charter
 
school
 
that
 
offers
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
educational
 
models
 
designed
 
to
 
support
 
the
 
individual
 
learning
 
needs
 
of
 
each
 
student
 
while
 
ensuring
 
the
 
acquisition
 
of
 
the
 
skills
 
necessary
 
for
 
success
 
in
 
the
 
21st
 
century.
 
Parent
 
participation
 
and
 
engagement
 
are
 
at
 
the
 
core
 
of
 
each
 
educational
 
model
 
and
 
require
 
parents
 
and
 
teachers
 
to
 
work
 
closely
 
together
 
on
 
activities
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
creation
 
of
 
a
 
student
 
learning
 
plan,
 
providing
 
support
 
to
 
the
 
student
 
during
 
the
 
learning
 
process,
 
monitoring
 
student
 
progress,
 
and
 
the
 
identification
 
and
 
implementation
 
of
 
interventions
 
and
 
enrichment
 
for
 
the
 
student.
  
The
 
collaboration
 
and
 
communication
 
between
 
the
 
teachers
 
and
 
parents
 
are
 
vital
 
not
 
only
 
to
 
the
 
success
 
of
 
the
 
student,
 
but
 
also
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
parents
 
have
 
the
 
information
 
and
 
resources
 
that
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
remain
 
active
 
and
 
effective
 
in
 
their
 
child's
 
education.
 
 
Parents
 
are
 
also
 
provided
 
with
 
several
 
opportunities
 
to
 
engage
 
in
 
the
 
school
 
planning
 
and
 
decision-making
 
process.
  
Parent
 
meetings
 
with
 
school
 
administration
 
are
 
conducted
 
regularly
 
in
 
both
 
small
 
and
 
large
 
group
 
settings
 
and
 
address
 
school
 
components
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
allocation
 
of
 
resources,
 
additional
 
learning
 
opportunities
 
for
 
students,
 
instructional
 
resources
 
and
 
material,
 
and
 
the
 
evaluation
 
of
 
the
 
school's
 
progress
 
toward
 
goals
 
and
 
outcomes.
  
In
 
addition,
 
the
 
parent
 
involvement
 
opportunities
 
range
 
in
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
commitment
 
required
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
increase
 
participation
 
and
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
feedback
 
and
 
input
 
received
 
from
 
parents.
  
Formal
 
parent
 
committees
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
Parent
 
Advisory
 
Council
 
(PAC)
 
and
 
the
 
Science

Committee
 
are
 
established
 
annually,
 
while
 
individual

on
 
a

are
 
also
 
conducted
 
for

who
 
have
 
particular

if

or
 
concern.
  
Parents
 
are
 
also
 
invited

at
 
the

FPCS
 
is
 
committed
 
to
 
providing
 
teachers
 
with
 
ongoing
 
professional
 
development
 
in
 
their
 
individual
 
areas
 
of
 
professional
 
interest
 
and
 
growth,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
in
 
areas
 
that
 
have
 
been
 
collectively
 
identified
 
by
 
the
 
teachers.
  
The
 
professional
 
development
 
process
 
begins
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
start
 
of
 
the
 
school
 
year,
 
with
 
an
 
alignment
 
of
 
professional
 
development
 
opportunities
 
and
 
resources
 
to
 
the
 
FPCS
 
goals
 
and
 
student
 
learning
 
outcomes.
   
In
 
collaboration
 
with
 
an
 
administrator,
 
teachers
 
identify
 
the
 
specific
 
strategies
 
and
 
activities
 
that
 
they
 
will
 
obtain
 
from
 
each
 
professional
 
development
 
(i.e.
 
training,
 
workshop,
 
resource,
 
coaching,
 
etc.)
 
and
 
the
 
impact
 
on
 
the
 
students™
 
skills
 
and
 
behaviors
 
that
 
is
 
expected
 
as
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
the
 
implementation
 
of
 
those
 
strategies
 
and
 
activities.
  
Throughout
 
the
 
school
 
year,
 
teachers
 
and
 
administrators
 
continue
 
to
 
work
 
closely
 
together
 
to
 
monitor
 
the
 
implementation
 
and
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
strategies
 
and
 
activities
 
obtained
 
from
 
the
 
professional
 
development
 
opportunities
 
and
 
to
 
also
 
determine
 
ways
 
in
 
which
 
impactful
 
practices
 
can
 
be
 
shared
 
with
 
other
 
teachers.
 
 
FPCS
 
also
 
utilizes
 
collaborative
 
teacher
 
teams
 
to
 
provide
 
teachers
 
with
 
additional
 
opportunities
 
to
 
reflect
 
on
 
instructional
 
practices
 
and
 
strategies
 
for
 
improving
 
student
 
learning.
  
Professional
 
Learning
 
Communities
 
(PLC)
 
of
 
teachers
 
meet
 
regularly
 
to
 
further
 
explore
 
the
 
Common
 
Core
 
State
 
Standards
 
(CCSS)
 
and
 
to
 
evaluate
 
individual
 
student
 
progress.
  
During
 
these
 
meetings,
 
grade-level
 
teacher
 
groups
 
review
 
instructional
 
plans
 
and
 
coursework
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
develop
 
a
 
common
 
articulation
 
of
 
each
 
standard
 
and
 
to
 
establish
 
an
 
example
 
of
 
acceptable
 
evidence
 
of
 
learning
 
for
 
each
 
standard.
   
The
 
deeper
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
CCSS
 
and
 
evidence
 
of
 
learning
 
gained
 
from
 
the
 
PLC,
 
enables
 
teachers
 
to
 
better
 
evaluate
 
the
 
progress
 
of
 
each
 
student
 
and
 
to
 
provide
 
immediate
 
and
 
appropriate
 
interventions
 
and
 
support
 
to
 
those
 
students
 
who
 
need
 
it.
 
 
The
 
FPCS
 
professional
 
development
 
calendar
 
includes
 
5
 
All-Staff
 
Professional
 
Development
 
Days,
 
monthly
 
half-day
 
PLC
 
Meetings,
 
monthly
 
half-day
 
Committee
 
Meetings,
 
and
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
day
 
of
 
off-site
 
professional
 
development
 
for
 
each
 
teacher.
