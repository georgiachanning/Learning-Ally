School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Condition
s and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Cutten School provides a safe, clean, tobacco
-
free educational environment for students. One maintenance employee and 
two custodians ensure the good condition and cleanliness of our buildings, restrooms, and 
grounds. All classrooms and 
support services rooms are equipped with a telephone, an intercom system, and access to the Internet. A security system 
is present to protect every room.
 
 
Visitors are welcomed at Cutten School and sign in at the school office. 
Due to the close
-
knit nature of our school, 
unfamiliar visitors on campus are very rare and are immediately greeted by school personnel.
 
 
Cutten Elementary School was built in 1951. The school has fourteen regular classrooms, a library,  a multipurpose roo
m, 
and facilities for student support resources, music, social services/counseling, speech  and our after
-
school program. 
Facilities also include two baseball fields, a multi
-
dimensional playground structure, three wall ball courts, and a large 
athletic fi
eld.  A new playground structure has been purchased and will be installed in the spring of 2020.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.

The Cutten District implemented the Leadership Team in 2014. Teachers apply to be on
 
the team and receive
 
an annual stipend of $2,000. This Team, that includes both administrators, meets weekly to plan professional
 
development opportunities for teacher and evaluate the effectiveness of professional development
 
opportunities offered. 
Input
 
is regularly sought from certificated staff to identify areas of focus for
 
professional development.

Professional development is offered during our preservice days at the beginning of each school year; during
 
our early release collaborative Wednesdays; 
and several times a year, teachers are offered a stipend to extend
 
their workday into the evening. The District reimburses teachers for registration to selected professional
 
development 
opportunities offered through the County Office of Education, and othe
r professional resources.
 
To evaluate our system 
for professional growth and improvement for teachers, we survey certificated staff,
 
teachers meet in grade level teams to 
assess needs, and we meet as a district several times a year to examine
 
student achie
vement data to help assess need for 
professional development.
 
 
New teachers participate in the Teacher Induction Program, formerly known as BTSA and are mentored by
 
veteran 

on Program
 
(NCTIP) is a two
-
year 
program that provides a link between the skills acquired in the Preliminary Credential
 
Program to the experiences in the 
classroom. Candidates work with a Mentor Teacher to further develop the
 
knowledge and skills needed to
 
achieve 
competency in the California Standards. Mentors provide support,
 
experiences, and professional development to help 
candidates meet the CCTC requirements for a Clear
 
Credential. When a new teacher is hired, experienced teachers provide 
continual su
pport in all aspects of the
 
profession. Grade level teams meet regularly to provide assistance and support to 
our newest teachers.
