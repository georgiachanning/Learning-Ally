By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The Yucaipa
-
Calimesa Joint Unified School District sets a high priority to ensure that sufficient and current textbooks and 
materials are available to support each school's instructional program. The district went t
hrough an evaluation on October 
1, 2019, and has sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, and/or science lab equipment pursuant to 
the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. County School representatives conducted a Will
iams visit in August 
of 2019, finding the school has sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials. The district determined that 
there are also sufficient visual and performing arts materials.
 
 
All students, including Special Education and
 
English Learner students, have access to adopted instructional materials in 
core subjects.  These materials are for use in the classroom and/or to take home to complete required homework 
assignments.  All textbooks and instructional materials used within 
the district are aligned with the California State Content 
Standards and Frameworks.
 
 
Instructional materials in all subjects were approved by the Board of Education. Although the Board
-
adopted instructional 
materials in Mathematics are not on the State Bo
ard of Education list, the materials were recommended by an adoption 
committee of staff and community members following extensive research on the alignment of the materials to California 
State Content Standards and Frameworks, and a pilot of the materials 
to study their positive impact on the children we 
serve. The district has not yet adopted instructional materials in History
-
Social Science in the time since the State Board 
approved History
-
Social Science programs in November, 2017. The district is collab
orating with community stakeholder 
groups to determine the most appropriate materials for implementing the state standards and framework in History
-
Social Science.
 
 
Calimesa Elementary School has an excellent library housing nearly 15,000 titles, not count
ing textbooks.  The collection 
includes books, magazines, videos, DVDs, as well as reference and professional materials.  The collection is labeled 
according to Accelerated Reader levels to ensure students choose books within their reading level.  The libr
ary is staffed 
by a 30 hour
-
per
-
week library technician, and all classes in grades kindergarten through fifth visit the library, as a 
minimum, on a bi
-
weekly basis.  A wide range of picture books are regularly read to students in primary grades and 
occasio
nally to students in upper grades as well.  Two computer stations enable the students to access the collection 
through an online catalog and internet service is available for additional research.  Students may also search the collection
 
from their home com
puters via the school website.

Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors are 
proactive and conduct inspections at school sites on a continual basis.  Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working 
order are completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest 
priority to emergency repairs. During the most recent Williams site visit the site was found to have no extreme deficiencies.
 
 
CLEANING PROCESS AN
D SCHEDULE
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards 
is available at the school office or at the district office. The site administration team works daily with the custodial st
aff of 
two to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

or not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula

Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Calimesa Elementary School updates its safety plan yearly. This plan is reviewed by the staff at the Back to School staff 
meeting at the beginning of each year. It was also reviewed by our site safety team in September o
f 2019.  Fire, earthquake, 
and/or intruder drills are practiced monthly.
 
 
Calimesa Elementary School is a closed campus. During school hours the entrance is secured to ensure visitors check in 
with the front office. All visitors are required to sign in and
 
to wear a visitor badge during their stay. While we welcome 
visits by parents and community members, anyone wishing to be on campus during school hours should notify staff ahead 
of time. During lunch, breaks, and before and after school, yard aides, the p
rincipal, and teachers supervise students and 
monitor the campus.
 
 
During the 2017
-
2018 school year, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department conducted a Security Assessment at 
Calimesa Elementary. The assessment results indicated the campus is in go
od condition considering the age of the school.  
No issues of concern were recommended in the areas of Crisis Response and Disaster Preparedness; Agency Relationships 
and Reporting and Discipline Policies; Social and Cultural Considerations; and Staff Deve
lopment.
