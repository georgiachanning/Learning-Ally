describes
 
how
 
they
 
intend
 
to

for
 
all
 
pupils,

Description

Mission
 
Statement
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
 
The
 
Westfield
 
Village
 
School
 
learning
 
community
 
works
 
collaboratively
 
to
 
deliver
 
a
 
focused,
 
research
 
and
 
Common
 
Core
 
State
 
Standards
 
based
 
program
 
to
 
educate
 
and
 
develop
 
empowered,
 
motivated,
 
responsible
 
and
 
respectful
 
learners
 
who
 
master
 
grade
 
level
 
standards.
 
Our
 
school
 
has
 
long
 
served
 
the
 
Washington
 
Unified
 
School
 
District.
 
The
 
school
 
was
 
originally
 
built
 
in
 
1955,
 
and
 
has
 
since
 
expanded
 
to
 
include
 
(in
 
addition
 
to
 
the
 
classrooms),
 
a
 
library,
 
and
 
rooms
 
for
 
reading
 
specialists/coaches.
 
In
 
contrast
 
to
 
the
 
challenges
 
we
 
face,
 
we
 
have
 
many
 
strengths
 
that
 
support
 
our
 
efforts.
 
One
 
of
 
our
 
most
 
important
 
strengths
 
is
 
our
 
diversity.
 
We
 
celebrate
 
the
 
many
 
cultures
 
and
 
languages
 
which
 
make
 
up
 
the
 
Westfield
 
Village
 
student
 
population.
 
We
 
feel
 
that
 
students
 
at
 
our
 
school
 
are
 
part
 
of
 
a
 
very
 
unique
 
educational
 
experience
 
as
 
they
 
interact
 
with
 
others
 
who
 
are
 
so
 
different
 
yet
 
so
 
much
 
alike.
 
Teachers
 
use
 
the
 
unique
 
characteristics
 
of
 
each
 
student
 
to
 
enrich
 
their
 
curriculum
 
and
 
utilize
 
research-based
 
best
 
practices
 
so
 
all
 
our
 
students
 
"learn
 
and
 
succeed!"

safety,
 
Westfield
