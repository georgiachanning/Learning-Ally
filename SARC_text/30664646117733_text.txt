By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

-
20)
 
 
Our Belief Statements:
 
1. ALL children can learn.
 
2. Every st
udent deserves the opportunity to be prepared and encouraged to attend college, should they chose to do so.
 
 
Our Vision:
 
All students, without exception, are proficient in reading, writing, and math.
 
 
All students actively engage in the 21st century skills
 
of creativity, innovation, communication,
 
collaboration, critical thinking, and problem solving.
 
 
All students pursue their passion and
 
make a difference in the world.
 
 
Our Mission:
 
"At Kinoshita everyone matters. We will cultivate a community of 
lifelong learners with a clear pathway to college and 
career success."
 
 
School Profile:
 
Kinoshita Elementary opened in September 2000 and serves approximately 700 preschool through fifth grade students. 
Kinoshita is adjacent to the San Juan Capistrano Comm
unity Center/Sports Park Complex, the Boys and Girls Club of 
Capistrano Valley, and Marco Forster Middle School. The school has thirty
-
three classrooms, a library/media center, two 
computer labs and an auditorium. Within this beautiful facility is an atmos
phere of warmth, caring, and respect where 
children come to learn, grow, achieve, and dream.
 
 
In conjunction with CUSD, the Kinoshita staff has developed an outstanding instructional program which promotes 
achievement for all students by providing an effec
tive learning environment, effective instructional practices, and engages 
students in the 21st century skills of creativity/innovation, communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and problem
-
solving. Important reading, math, and language skills are c
ombined with a social studies and science program that focus 
on mastery of the Common Core State Standards. Every child receives instruction at his or her level in the skills and 
strategies necessary for success in reading and math.
 
 
At Kinoshita, we belie
ve that technology is a critical teaching and learning tool in a twenty
-
first century education. Our 
classrooms and computer labs feature the latest hardware and software available, including internet access from every 
room, an emphasis on multimedia, and 
integration of technology throughout the curriculum.

important teacher. Opportunities for parent invol
vement are numerous, including an active Parent Teacher Association 
and School Site Council, Family Curriculum nights, volunteer opportunities, and ongoing bilingual communication through 
conferences, newsletters, flyers, phone calls home to all families, 
and a web site. Our families and community members 
are encouraged to visit our on
-
site Parent University, which is facilitated by our staff bilingual community liaison. Kinoshita 
has established partnerships with many community organizations, including the
 
City of San Juan Capistrano, the Orange 

Brothers and Big Sisters of Orange County and various other community
-
based organizations. In con
junction with the 
YMCA, Kinoshita offers a daily after school homework support and daycare program which is completely funded through 
a state Prop. 49 grant. In addition, a partnership with Capistrano Unified Adult Education has enabled Kinoshita to offer 
on site parenting classes.
 
 
Classroom Discipline:
 

the social and problem
-
solving skills that are so essential in building successful soci
eties. Teamwork requires negotiation 
and decision
-
making skills and is increasingly important in the modern workplace. The foundation for success in this arena 
is built upon excellent listening, decision
-
making, and problem
-
solving skills. Using the Positi
ve Behavioral Interventions 
and Supports (PBIS) model, students are taught expected behaviors and receive recognition for contributing to the three 
core expectations at Kinoshita: caring for others, using positive actions, and showing respect for everyone.
 
 
Quality of Instruction and Leadership:
 
Kinoshita provides an excellent instructional program designed to meet the needs of our diverse population of students. 
Our teachers are trained in strategies for a complete range of learners, from gifted students t
o students requiring special 
support. We combine a strong foundation in reading, writing and math, with science and social studies activities, and 
CUSD Block Music for a well
-
rounded instructional program. Each of our staff members is part of a caring, pos
itive, 
professional team. They willingly share talents and expertise with one another and our students. Staff members share 
various leadership positions at the school, and share in the decision
-
making process through The Leadership Team and 
School Site Cou
ncil.
 
 
School Safety Plan:
 
The Kinoshita Staff recognizes that they play a critical role in student safety. Every school employee works in partnership 
to create an atmosphere of caring and respect. The Safety Plan is regularly updated and reviewed by the S
chool Site 
Council and the staff as a whole. Students are trained in procedures for safe evacuation and sheltering.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or 
programs 
of study.

Capistrano Unified School District places great value on the role of professional learning, and utilizes systems
-
wide 
structures and strategies to promote continuous learning of adults 
that result in increased learning for students.  The 
ongoing focus for professional learning is to support the district's Wildly Important Goal for Teaching and Learning.  It is 
the district goal to engage students in meaningful, challenging, and innovativ
e educational experiences to increase post
-
secondary options for all students.
 
 
It is the goal of  Capistrano Unified School District to ensure all students receive Great First Instruction (GFI).  The visi
on 
for GFI is that all learning environments includ
e Lesson Preparation, Interaction, Strategies, and Review and Assessment 
as defined by the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP).  By design, the model for providing professional 
learning is multi
-
tiered, and ranges from large
-
scale, district
-
w
ide learning opportunities focused on priority areas to site
-
specific, embedded professional learning (including coaching) that supports teachers in the transfer of that learning to the 

lemental training during the summer and after 
school hours to further support district initiatives and teacher needs for ongoing professional learning. The outcome of all 
CUSD professional learning is to improve educator effectiveness in order to increase 
student learning. In support of this 
outcome, administrators participate in professional learning to increase their knowledge of quality practices, California 
Content Standards, and strategies for instructional leadership.
 
 
Since 2004, all schools provide 
specific release time for embedded professional learning using late start or early release 
days.  In grades K
-
8, this time is known as ACE time (Articulation and Collaboration for Excellence).  The purpose of this 
time is for educators to examine the impac
t of their practice on student learning, with a focus on continuous improvement.  
Schools work to identify key areas of learning based on an analysis of student data, upon which they place their focus for 
professional learning and set annual measurable goa
ls based upon those identified areas of need. These areas are 
determined through the analysis of student learning data from multiple sources, including, but not limited to high stakes 
testing. The action plan developed to accomplish these goals outlines pr
iorities for teacher training and implementation.
 
 
Throughout the year, the structure of collaboration typically involves teacher teams engaging in ongoing examination of 
standards
-
based curriculum, the examination of meaningful formative and summative ass
essment data, and powerful 
teaching strategies that get results in student learning. In 2017 the District developed the CUSD Professional Learning 

ze Common 
Goals, Relational Trust, Focus on Learning, Shared Responsibility, Action
-
Oriented, Data Driven, and Systems and 
Structures for Support  to ensure all students are learning at high levels.  These embedded professional learning activities 
help pre
pare teams to provide a differentiated instructional program that meets the needs of all students.
 
 
Beginning teachers receive systematic training and support during their first two years of teaching within the CUSD 
Induction Program. This program assists 
new teachers as they build upon the skills they already possess upon entering the 
field of teaching, and provides them with support from a veteran teacher. The program is approved by the California State 
Commission on Teacher Credentialing and meets the re

to those activities previously described, all teachers may receive support, assistance, and opportunities to grow 
professionally through their participation in school site learning teams, st
udent study teams, from district resource 
teachers, and the Peer Assistance and Review Program.
