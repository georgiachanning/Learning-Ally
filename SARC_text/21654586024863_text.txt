About the SARC
 
By Febr
uary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fund
ing Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state 
and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the sc
hool, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019

Curriculum development is a district
-
wide effort. Teach
ers and administrators from all subject areas form working committees to draft recommendations 
on instructional materials.
 
 
The California Department of Education has determined textbook selection and adoption schedules. The district follows the sta
te sche
dule for these 
adoptions and has purchased textbooks from the most recent state
-
approved lists. All approved instructional materials are aligned with California content 
standards for core academic areas.
 
 
The Elementary School District Curriculum Advisory 
Council reviews curriculum recommendations and revisions materials utilized in the support of the 
instructional program. The Curriculum Council recommendations are forwarded to the Board of Education for final approval. Thi
s is an ongoing process, 
assuring
 
that all textbooks and instructional materials are systematically reviewed, updated, and supplemented.
 
 
This table shows some of the textbooks used with grade K

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
At Sun Valley School, our campus reflects the community we serve. We implement the PBIS (Positive Behavior 
Intervention and Supports) model to 
ensure that all students, parents, and staff adhere to three school
-
wide expectations (Be Respectful, Be Responsible and Be a Learner). The expectations 
are posted all over the school and students are rewarded for demons
trating these behaviors.
 
 
The school ensures that on
-
site supervision is provided 15 minutes before and after school. Before school, the City of San Rafael Community Services 
provides on
-
site Spanish Immersion every morning for an additional fee. The City 
of San Rafael also provides a large variety of afterschool classes (i.e. 
art, science, sports camp, music, theater, etc). Childcare is located off site at Parkside Childcare Center in downtown San R
afael. Transportation to 
childcare is provided by San Rafa
el City Schools for a fee.
 
 
District and school policy require that during the school day all guests to the campus check in at the school office and obta

them for security personnel and all staff and students.
 
 
The physical q
uality of the school campus influences teaching and learning. All students and faculty enjoy bright classrooms, many with vie
ws of the open 
space.
 
 
Sun Valley Elementary School was established in 1951 and is one of the oldest schools in the district. The s
chool has a total of 22 classrooms, a 
multipurpose building with a performance stage, art room, and science/music room and a student services (administration) buil
ding. The school 
underwent modernization in 2003
-
2004 with total modernization of existing cl
assrooms, the addition of a new two
-
story classroom building, expanded 
student services area, and construction of the new multipurpose building. The Sun Valley School has a new field and extensive
 
landscaping around the 
multipurpose building, by the parkin
g area, and between the student services office and classroom wing.

The district strives to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. All bathrooms, classrooms, and offices are c
leaned daily. Students are 
encouraged to help keep the campus 
clean by recycling. District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. An online maintenance order request process is used to ensure efficient s
ervice and that
 
emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority.

expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing 
school building components, became inoperative effective July 1, 2013. However, the district 
continues to make an annual contribution to support capital improvement projects, including deferred maintenance projects.
 
 
San Rafael voters approved Measure A in
 
November 2015 to fund capital facilities projects to improve our school facilities. Measure A provides $108 

 
 
SRCS' bond program is providing much needed capital 
improvements to our facilities to create safe, innovative learning environments and to provide 
instructional technology to support 21st century learning. Additional classrooms, labs and equipment are being built and impr
oved to reduce 
overcrowding in our s
chools and to better meet the growing demand for hands
-
on science, technology, engineering, arts and math (STEAM) classes. Site 

hes
e improvements, and the 
construction work is ongoing throughout the district.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Parent involvement is a vital component of the educational program at Sun Valley Elementary School. 
San Rafael City Schools would not be what it is 
today without the contributions of countless parents and family members who give their time and expertise as volunteers and w
ho share their financial 
resources to support the goals and aspirations of San Rafa
el schools.
 
 
The parent volunteer program serves as a comprehensive model of support that includes parents, senior citizens, community mem
bers, and businesses 
in volunteering in the classroom with children. We appreciate the over 250 volunteers that serve 
our students and our community! Parents are also 
made to feel welcome through various informational and community
-
building events, including back

to
-
school nights, thematic unit gallery walks, grade 
level gatherings, whole school events, parent conferences
