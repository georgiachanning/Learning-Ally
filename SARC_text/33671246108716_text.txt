About the SARC
 
By F
ebruary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control F
unding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
sta
te and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

School Safety Plan
 
The

mmitted on school 
campuses and at school related functions, identifying appropriate strategies and programs that will provide or ma
intain a high level of school safety, and 
addressing procedures for complying with existing laws related to school safety.
 
 
Fire drills are held at least twice a year at the secondary schools and once a month at the elementary schools. Disaster and 
earthqu
ake drills are conducted 
as needed. The School Safety Plan also includes the MVUSD discipline policy, which describes the consequences for student mis
conduct (such as 
detention, Saturday School, suspension, and expulsion).
 
 
The School Safety Plan was last 
reviewed, updated, and discussed with school staff on 8/29/19 and safety is also discussed at all staff meetings.
