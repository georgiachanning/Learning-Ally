School Description
 
Elverta Elementary is proud to present our current School Accountability Report 
Card. Students and 
their families, faculty members and staff, work diligently to make education the highest priority of 
our community Elverta provides a safe, caring environment which enables learners to reach their 
individual potential, including literacy
, knowledge and skills needed to exercise the rights and 
humanitarian responsibilities of citizenship and the ability to compete in a global economy. Staff 
supports the view that emotional, psychological and social needs of students are intrinsically 
relat
ed to academic achievement and fully promote this approach. Elverta School Site Council, in 
conjunction with all share
-
holders, develops and applies the vision for the District. About This 
School Originally, the Lincoln Elementary School, now called the El
verta Joint Elementary School 
District, was constructed in 1855 on homestead land donated by David Strauch located on the 
present Strauch ranch west of the Western Pacific Railroad tracks.  The district which was then 
named Lincoln School District went as 
far as the Archway, now Rio Linda, north to the county line, 
east to the Center Joint School District, and west to the American River.  About 1904, more people 
came to this area, including the Northern Electric Railroad which came through Elverta going as 
far 
as Chico, and a new school district began to form. The original school house was a one
-
room wood 
building, with no electricity or plumbing. Very few of the students could speak English because the 
predominate language was German. Some of the old famili
es who had children attending the 
school were Jacob Scheidel who came from Alsace
-
Lorraine, Germany in 1860, Charles 
Schmittmeyer and David Strauch from Bavaria, Germany.  In 1897, the school house was moved on 
an area of land donated by V.F. Strauch now l
ocated on the corner of Elverta Road and Elwyn 

and C.T, Horgan, from the Trustees of the Lincoln School District for one acre of land, more or less. 
In 1911, a n
ew and larger one room school house was constructed on that same site. In the early 

Elwyn Avenue and Elverta Road was later used as a lodge hall for the Modern
 
Woodsmen of 
America.  The School which was wood and stucco had one small classroom and one large classroom 
with large folding doors to make two classrooms when needed. In the larger classroom there was 
a stage where silent movies were screened for the com
munity for night recreation. Desks were one 
piece, bolted to the floor. The school was heated by coal stoves, and in 1927, the school burned to 
the ground as a result of one of the coal stoves. Classes were held in various homes until the school 
was rebuil

School District met in the Elverta Elementary School for the purpose of organizing a Mothers Club. 
The current version of the P.T.A. replaced the Mothers Club in 

community club of Elverta changed the name of the school from Lincoln to Elverta Elementary 
School, Elverta School District. On December 6, 1954, two classrooms were added; on November 
15, 1957, three more were completed; and
 
on November 15, 1960, three classrooms, a 
kindergarten, administrative office, multipurpose room and kitchen were added, giving a total of 
13 classrooms. The Cornerstone Ceremony for the Elverta Elementary School was held Saturday, 
April 30, 1977.  The Al
pha School District joined the Elverta District in 1965, when Alpha School was 
built on Elwyn and Artesia. Ten acres of land were purchased for $18,000. The original Alpha School 
in Placer County was a two
-
room school house on Baseline Road between Elder S
treet and Pleasant 

District now included parts of two counties. In 1981 Alpha Elementary School was converted to an 
intermediate school for seventh and eighth g

changed to Alpha Technology Middle School. In 2005 it was named a Distinguished California 
Middle School.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountabi
lity Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Ac
countability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in 
the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abou
t the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal 
or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the St

Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca

School Safety Pl
an
 
Maintaining a safe and orderly environment in order to maximize student learning is a top priority of Elverta Elementary Scho
ol. This school is in 
compliance with all laws, rules and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state safety standar
ds. The school plan, developed in conjunction 
with local law enforcement and fire departments, includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during or following an 
emergency or local disaster. 
Students receive regular training in fire, intruder, nat
ural disaster and earthquake events. Emergency drills are conducted regularly throughout the school 

-
to
-
date restroom facilities, American
 
Disabilities Act compliance and an aesthetically pleasing environment in which to learn and work.  Additionally, we view the 
concept of discipline as an 
integral part of the learning process. In this context, we teach and model pro
-
social behavior by trea
ting children with respect and dignity and by offering 
a quality curriculum to keep all students engaged in learning. Discipline problems are few and minor (as you will read in oth
er sections of this report) and 
the school offers programs, such as Characte
r Counts assemblies to support students in taking responsibility for and improving their conduct.  The School 
Safety Plan was last reviewed, updated, and discussed with the school faculty in November 2019.
