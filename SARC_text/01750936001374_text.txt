School Description
 
Dublin Elementary School has been a fixture in the community since 1961. Since its establishment, staff, 
students, and families have joined together to create a community that ensures all children have the 
access, skills, resources, knowledge, and experiences to prepare them for future college and career 
endeavors. In classrooms, on the playground, and in our
 
global community we want our students to 
value diversity and to be inclusive leaders, problem solvers, pursuers of knowledge, effective 
communicators, and creative thinkers. Therefore, we provide them with a rigorous and relevant core 
academic foundation 
that is centered on character development, higher order thinking skills, teamwork, 
technology, and 21st century learning skills. Our goal is for our diverse population of learners to become 
compassionate, ethical, and inquisitive global citizens. Presently
, we serve 910 students in preschool 
through the fifth grade.  We also serve three moderate
-
severe and one mild
-
moderate in Specialized 
Academic Instruction (SAI) classes.  Within our population, 33% of our students are white, 32% are Asian, 
17% are Hispan
ic or Latino, 13% are Socioeconomically Disadvantaged, 10% are Two or More Races, 7% 
are English Language Learners, and 6% have Learning Disabilities.
 
 
To guide our instructional practice, Dublin Elementary has placed its focus on the Local Control 
Account

Standards
-
Smarter Balanced Assessments, Priority #4 Pupil Achievement, and Priority #8 Pupil 

on formative assessments, 
academic vocabulary, comprehensive interventions, and acceleration, as described by John Hattie 
(2009), have made us a model school for the implementation of highly effective instructional strategies. 
We are proud of this accompli
shment and the opportunities we have had to share our knowledge, 
expertise, and resources throughout the district.
 
 

regularly contribute to the following d
istrict level committees: Professional Learning Communities (PLC), 
Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS), Grade Level PLCs, Leadership Teams, English Language 
Acquisition Committees (ELAC), DUSD Curricula Councils, Gifted and Talented Education, Visual an
d 
Performing Arts (VAPA), Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Committee, and Technology and Safety 
Committees. The measurable academic gains observed at Dublin Elementary School are the result of 
these collaborative efforts as well as targeted, skill
-
based Response to Intervention practices.
 
 
Dublin Elementary is a community built on the motto, "Shark Pride":
 
 

 
Positive attitude...............Speak with kindness and show an open mind.
 

 
Respect.............................Staff, students, and families wor
king together.
 

 
Integrity............................Honesty, responsibility, and a clean campus.
 

 
Doing our best effort........Hard work and focus.
 

 
Encouragement................Celebrating our victories and differences.
 
 
At Dublin Elementary School, our pro
gress and achievements have been strengthened by this shared 



inquiry, action orientation and experimentation, commitment to continuous improvement, and results

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We choose our textbooks from lists that have already been approved by the 
state education officials. For more than six years, panels of scholars have 
decided what California students should learn and be able to do. Their decisions are known as the California Content Standard
s, and they apply to all 
public schools in the state. T
he textbooks we use and the test we give are based on these content standards, and we expect our teachers to be firmly 
focused on them.
 
 
All students have their own set of textbooks to use in class or at home.
 
 
The elementary, kindergarten to grade 5, Engl
ish
-
Language Arts textbooks are from the 2002 adoption list not the most recent 2008 adoption list. During 
the current financial situation, districts have been given the flexibility to use State funds for textbooks for other needs a
s approved by the local 
School 
Board. This flexibility allows districts to continue to use materials from the previous adoption list and still meet the requ
irement of having the most recent 
state
-
approved materials. Therefore, while our materials for K

-
Language Arts are
 
not from the most recent state

approved list, we are still 
compliant with State regulations.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
This inspection determines the school 
facility's good repair status using ratings of good condition, fair condition, or poor condition. The overall summary 
of facility conditions uses ratings of exemplary, good, fair, or poor condition. At the time of this school facility inspecti
on, no defici
encies were found.
 
 
Our building is 50 years old. In 2003, classrooms renovations were done on 50 percent of the campus, including new roofing, e
nergy
-
efficient heating 
and air
-
conditioning systems, ceilings, and lighting. Student and staff restrooms were 
modernized to current standards and Americans with Disabilities 
Act requirements. The campus
-
wide fire
-
alarm system was also replaced. The staff room was updated with new cabinets in 2005. In the summer of 2006, 
the overhead walkways were removed to ensure
 
safety; they were replaced in the spring of 2010 with bond funds.
 
 
In the summer of 2009, major construction started on the renovation of Dublin Elementary. Phase 1 included demolition of the 
existing kindergarten 
classrooms and installation of a new play
 
structure and shade structure on the back part of campus. In the year of 2009
-
10 school year construction 
began to complete the fourth and fifth grade classrooms and the new kindergarten complex. As a result in the fall of 2010, Du
blin Elementary School 
b
egan the school year with new overhead walkways and a state
-
of
-
the
-
art rebuilt kindergarten wing and a completely new fourth and fifth grade wing. 
Along with these new added features, the entire campus was repainted with a fresh, new color that united the 
old and new features of the school, and 
a new updated mural reflecting the environment of the Bay Area.
 
 
Restrooms and the campus are cleaned daily by our site custodian. An evening cleaning crew cleans each classroom daily. Distr
ict maintenance picks up 
l
itter, removes graffiti, and maintains landscaping on a regular schedule. We participate in the Go Green Recycling initiative
, and students recycle paper, 
aluminum, cardboard, and plastic bottles.

We have an inviting library that holds approximately 1,100
 
volumes that have on average age of 13 years. The library has five student computer stations 
and one search station.
 
 
Our media technician staffs the library daily for 30 hours a week. Students visit the library once a week and can check out t
wo to three 
books weekly. 
Every two years the media techs work together to do a complete search and remove outdated and overly worn books form our coll
ection. Every year we 
add approximately 100 books using proceeds from our annual book fair and funds from the School 
and Library Improvement Plan fund. Our families are 
very generous with their support of the library and donate many books as well. Input from teachers, students, and the media t
ech help us build a balanced 
collection.
 
 
All of our classrooms are rich in tec
hnology and have SMART boards, document cameras, voice enhancing systems, and student computers. We also have 
a computer lab and a half
-
time computer technician who maintains the computers and instructs teachers in how to use different kinds of software. 
T
eachers bring their students to our computer lab at least once a week, where fourth and fifth graders learn to type, conduct 
research on the internet, 
do math on simple spreadsheets, and create Power
-
 
Point presentations. Younger students will start to lea
rn typing, work on educational websites, 
rehearse math and reading skills, write, and create.
 
 
All teachers have access to email and the internet and maintain a website. They use computers to keep assessment data and cor
respond via email with 
parents and c
olleagues.
 
 
The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school buildi
ng components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

Types of Services Funded
 
Federal Title One funds are allocated to schools for the purpose of 
providing all children with an equitable and high
-
quality education.  At 
Dublin Elementary, our Title One funds support: a certificated intervention 
teacher, voc
abulary
-
rich reading books, and supplemental math materials. 
In addition, our site intervention budget funds our Multi
-
tiered System of 
Support (MTSS) Model which supports students in meeting their learning 
goals and targets. These monies go toward teacher
 
collaboration days, 
professional development, and a certificated intervention teacher. Along 
with this support, our Parent Faculty Club (PFC) raises funds for classroom 
supplies, field trips, technology, and fifth grade outdoor education camp.  
The PFC al
so hosts community
-
building events such as movie night, the 
spring carnival, the read
-
a
-
thon, family dance night, and an online auction.  
Our school's All Student Body (ASB) raises money for science, fine arts, 
technology, character education, the school g
arden, fifth grade camp, 
music, health and fitness, and Student Council through fundraisers such as 
our annual jog
-
a
-
thon.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information 
about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports 
for accountability (e.g., test data, en
rollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are 
publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Li
brary). Access to the Internet 
at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, 
the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending on 
availabil
ity), the types of software programs available on a workstation, 
and the ability to print documents.

At Dublin Elementary School, the success of our students is a result of family, staff, and student collaboration.  We are str
ong partners in providing our 
children with a rigorous and differentia
ted education that prepares them for future college and career endeavors.  Each year, our parents and families 
donate numerous hours volunteering in classrooms, serving on School Site Council, participating in Parent Faculty Club meetin
gs, organizing fundr
aisers 
to support programs and student learning goals, facilitating community service projects, attending English Learners Advisory 
Committee meetings, 
providing outreach to new families, chaperoning field trips, overseeing the school garden and Run Club, 
and supporting our Shark Pride Character 
Education program.
 
 
To strengthen the ties between home and school, the Dublin team also offers parent
-
teacher conferences, Back to School Night, Open House, and family 
festivals and activity nights. At Dublin Eleme
ntary, we always welcome new volunteers!

School Safety Plan
 
The staff monitors school grounds 15 minutes before school as well as at all recesses and break periods. Office and custodial
 
staff, including a Campus 
Supervisor and site administration, also c
arry radios throughout the day. In addition, site administration manages the parking lot and crosswalk areas in 
the morning while the Campus Supervisor monitors it in the afternoon.  During lunchtime, noon supervisors, a Campus Superviso
r, and administrati
on 
regularly monitor the playground, cafeteria, gates/fences, and courtyard areas. In class, teachers use the Dublin Elementary 
Behavior Matrix to review 
class guidelines, school safety procedures, and expectations for student behavior. All visitors must e
nter the school through the main gate and sign in at 
the office, where they receive a bright, color
-
coded badge to wear throughout their stay.
 
 
Our School Safety Plan is reviewed annually.  It was last revised and reviewed with staff in October 2019 and co
ntinues to be an ongoing discussion at 
our site during staff meetings, parent coffees, and Site Council meetings. The plan includes procedures for emergencies, evac
uations, shelters in place, 
and lockdowns. It also lists a current inventory of emergency su
pplies. We work with the Alameda County Fire Department and the District safety 
committee to plan for emergency preparedness and the training of staff. In addition to these protocols, our campus practices 
emergency drills monthly.

Dedicated staff development days are scheduled on the school
-
year calendar during the negotiation process between the Dublin Unified School District 
(DUSD) and the Dublin Teachers Association. Content for two of the three days is 
usually determined by DUSD based on areas of focus, textbook adoption 
cycles, and DUSD's Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP). In alignment with this focus, the teachers, specialists, and adm
inistrators at Dublin 
Elementary School examine state, format
ive, and common formative assessments to refine our instructional vision and to modify our intervention and 
enrichment supports strategically. This collaborative work assists us in designing our third staff development day for the sc
hool year.
 
 
Additional 
staff development opportunities take place during trainings where teachers are released through use of substitutes to attend 
observational 
rounds, demonstration lessons, workshops, and/or conferences. They also occur during after school workshops, grade le
vel collaborations, Response to 
Intervention Consult (RTI) meetings, leadership meetings, staff meetings, and through the use of site
-
based instructional coaches.
 
 
Educators partake in the following professional development opportunities to support our LCA
P and instructional vision:
 

 
Safety Care training.
 

 
Capturing Kids' Hearts training (by the Flippin Group)
 

 
Tri
-
Valley Teacher Induction Project (TV/TIP) for new teachers
 

 
Technology Coaching for a variety of software and hardware
 

 
Illuminate (data management s
ystem) training in analyzing student data
 

 
Site coaching by an Instructional Coach in literacy and mathematics.
 

 
Site training by an English Language Development Coach.
 

 
Site training by a Science Coach.
 
Along with these professional development 
opportunities, teachers have piloted the adoption of new textbooks, served on DUSD committees to develop 
interim assessments, and attended workshops to improve their skills. In addition, we dismiss students at 2:00 p.m. on Monday 
and Tuesday to allow time 
for teachers to collaborate, both within and across grade levels. We also have 21 days district wide where students are relea
sed at 2:00 so teachers can 
collaborate.
 
 
We also hold three district
-
wide professional development days each school year.
