Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Year and month in which data were collected:
 
9/2019
 
 
Happy Valley Elementary held a public hearing on September 11, 2019, and 
determined that each school within the district 
had sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are g
iven their own individual standards
-
aligned 
textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Depart
ment of Education, making 
the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and 
a
dministrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. 
The table displays information collected in September 2019 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., 
California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/
literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California St
ate University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State pri
ority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are given a 

may volunteer to assist teachers and instructional aides in the classroom with special projects or work with individuals or 
small groups in daily lear
ning activities. Parental support at home with homework, school projects and major reports, and 
reading with a child significantly promotes student achievement. The positive impact that consistent parent involvement 
has on student progress is greatly appre
ciated by teachers and aides alike.
 
 
Parent representatives are an integral part of the School Site Council. An equal number of parents and staff members 
develop and review school surveys and the LCAP. The School Site Council supports learning by monitorin
g a budget which 
provides support for instructional activities and school improvement projects.
 
 

and co
-
curricular activities. The annual 

raises extra funds for instructional aides in each of the classrooms, a credentialed art & music teacher, a library coordinat
or 
and a life lab coordinator. The generosity of Happ
y Valley parents through their contributions of volunteer time and 
financial assistance are an integral part of the success of every student
