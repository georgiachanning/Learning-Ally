By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Vine Elementary is a community and a team. It is our mission to establish a school environment where every student has 
the opportunity to receive a stellar education
-
one that meets their individual needs in a safe and loving environ
ment 
where their hearts are captured, their spirits are supported, and their minds are challenged. Vine Elementary's mission is 
committed to building and maintaining a place of excellence where every student acquires the knowledge, skills and core 
values n
ecessary to achieve personal success in and out of the classroom. Our common vision works to ensure that our 
focus is student
-
centered.  Vine Elementary is committed to the development of all students to become effective, 
successful life
-
long learners and 
productive citizens.  We are dedicated to the task of ensuring all students meet or exceed 
grade
-

comprised of staff, parents, and students.  We
 
strive to educate the whole child and work tirelessly to ensure that every 
student, regardless of their socioeconomic background, language proficiency, individual needs, or ethnicity, receives a 
solid, standards
-
based education following the California St
ate Standards.
 
 
Classrooms are alive with differentiated instruction to challenge all students with stimulating units of study that integrate
 
all subject areas. Our teachers work together to provide a rigorous curriculum to our students at each grade level
. Our 
Kindergarten, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th
-
grade teams provide flexible grouping to our students for 40 minutes of Reading 
instruction four days a week. Teachers offer differentiated classroom experiences using formative assessments to 
determine individual
 
needs. Students in grades 2 through 5 participate in weekly STEM instruction.  Grades 2 and 3 
concentrate on the science of robotics and coding while grades 4 and 5 are guided through game design.  We offer several 
extracurricular activities, such as choi
r, drama club, running club, student council, and "Young Rembrandts" (after school 
art class).
 
 
Vine's Student Outreach Services, comprised of intervention opportunities and enrichment activities, are designed to 
encourage and assist students in reaching t
heir full potential.  The supportive staff, concerned parents, and involved 
community members work together to ensure student growth toward excellence.  Our school motto, "Vine eagles soar to 
success", serves to underscore our expectations for continued st
udent success as well as to acknowledge student efforts 
and accomplishments. Students are recognized for their achievement and hard work at Monday Morning Assemblies, 
monthly award assemblies, and lunches with the principal.  Eagle Award recipients partici
pate in weekly raffles for fun 
prizes. Student work is also showcased on the walls in the front office. Special Education teachers collaboratively work 
with classroom teachers to plan instructional opportunities aligned to the core curriculum and provide s
tudents with 
mainstreaming opportunities as defined in their IEPs. Vine's Best Buddies program pairs students in our Autism Focus 
classroom with peers (buddies) from their neighboring general education classroom. In addition, Vine's Teacher on Special 
Assi
gnment (TOSA) has welcome meetings with foster youth to ensure they have all the necessary resources to be 
successful at Vine. She monitors their academic progress and recommends intervention as needed to help address any 
achievement gaps.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We at Vine welcome family and community members as part of our team, based on the growing body of evidence that 
adult support, both at school and home, are critical for student success. Opportunities for parent involvement are offered 
throughout the year a
nd include volunteering in classrooms, attending workshop sessions, serving on parent councils, and 
joining our PTA. Our School Site Council (SSC), which includes staff and parent/community members, makes program 
recommendations and is an integral force on
 
how school funds are utilized. Parents are encouraged and welcomed to 
volunteer in classrooms, on field trips, and by helping out with special events and school activities. We encourage parent 
involvement by joining the PTA and by attending SSC, ELAC, GAT
E, and Title I meetings. Parents are also involved by 
attending site Parent Universities (trainings) and monthly Coffee with the Principal. A special education parent liaison is 
accessible to families to address questions about our special education progra
ms. In addition, Vine's site TOSA is also 
available as onsite support for our foster youth and their families. Our district's unique Family Resource Center provides 
a range of services and assistance, such as tutoring, enrichment programs, and community re
sources.
 
 
We know that by working together we can make a difference.  If you are interested in becoming more involved at Vine, 
please contact us at (626) 931

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
As required by the California Education Code, Vine has an updated school safety plan, which was developed by School Site 
Council (SSC) in collaboration with teachers, classified staff, parents, and first responders to ensure it is up
-
to
-
date and 
complete. 
The plan has policies and procedures addressing critical issues including disaster preparedness; crisis response; 
mental and physical health; earthquake emergencies; school learning environment; discipline, suspension, and/or 
expulsion; hate crime reportin
g; child abuse reporting; release of a pesticide or toxic substance; and other safety
-
related 
topics.  In addition, Vine's daily schedule, rules, and supervision duties are also outlined. Vine has sufficient classroom 
space, playground, and space to suppor
t teaching and learning. The 2019
-
2020 Safety Plan was approved at the January 
29, 2020 meeting following the discussions and feedback from staff at the August 2019 and November 2019 staff meetings, 
and the December 2019 and January 2020 SSC meetings.  Vin
e's 5th
-
grade executive student council board were also 
included in this annual review in November 2019. Together, we have developed a plan designed to maintain a safe, secure, 
and peaceful school environment.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
At Vine, funds are used to offer intervention opportunities to all students in need (Foster, Homeless, EL, Special Education,
 
and General 
Education).  Funds are used to offer reading intervention during the regular instructional day to individuals 
in grades K
-
4. In addition, funds are used to offer after school enrichment classes for our students identified as gifted and 
talented and to purc
hase materials to help teachers differentiate instruction in the classrooms. Additional after school 
intervention sessions are offered to students to reinforce concepts and skills in a smaller group. Our PTA provides funds 
for assemblies, field trips, Stud
ent of the Month incentives, and special events.  Vine also receives funds from Box Tops 
for Education and payroll contributions from Edison employees. Additional funds are awarded through yearly participation 
in grant opportunities with various organizati
ons including, but not limited to, West Covina Rotary, Discovery Science 
Foundation, and FEDCO grants. Our site TOSA is our liaison for our homeless and foster youth. She works diligently with 
our office staff and families to ensure these students are give
n every opportunity to succeed. She also works closely with 
the District Homeless liaison. Vine has Kindergarten, 1
-

5 "Autism Focus" classes that offer a specialized 
environment for students with an individualized education plan. The special educa
tion teachers and support staff have

Each Wednesday students are dismissed an hour early to provide time for staff development opportunities for teachers 
and to allow our teachers to work as a group in a "Professional Learning Community".  In addition, we have full
-
days 
dedicated to staff dev
elopment throughout the year. During the 2017
-
2018 school year, the total number of days for 
professional development was 10 full days and 30 after school meetings.  In the 2018
-
2019 school year, the total number 
of days for professional development was 14
 
full days and 30 after school meetings; and the total number of planned days 
for professional development for the 2019
-
2020 year is 19 full days and 30 after school meetings. Professional 
development sessions for the year include: building teacher knowled
ge of the core and supplemental curriculum (Eureka 
Math, i
-
Ready Diagnostic and Instruction, Renaissance Learning Tools, etc.) and our reading intervention program for 
grades K
-
4 (DIBELS 8, SIPPS, and DIBELS Data System website); deepening teacher knowledg
e of the standards; conducting 
ongoing data analysis, and building a repertoire of best practices.  Additional professional development topics include 
school safety and behavioral supports (with focus on Restorative Discipline and Zones of Regulation) for 
the classroom 
teachers. As a site, we are continuously analyzing data to inform instruction. The previous CAASPP and ELPAC data have 
been analyzed along with SIPPS and DIBELS data, other benchmark data, classwork, and grade level created common 
assessments
.  We look at trends in the data to determine next steps and ways of supporting the students in acquiring the 
necessary skills and concepts.  We use data to build our intervention classes, to set our goals, and to measure our success. 
Follow

up training an
d PD refreshers allow teachers to utilize the curriculum and multiple components more effectively. 
Professional development training is conducted in many ways.  Traditionally, training is done onsite by the principal, site 
TOSA, district Reading TOSA, and 
other practitioners familiar with the topic. On occasion, outside representatives and 
consultants are brought in to lead the training (i.e. Epilepsy Center).  The site also funds attendance at the local 
conferences and workshops (such as those available th
rough the Bureau of Educational Research).  Individuals who attend 
off
-
campus training share their learning with the site and work with teams to apply this gained knowledge.
 
 
Staff development is not limited to our certificated personnel.  The principal pa
rticipates in monthly meetings and 
continuous PD for school leadership. Vine School has one non
-
classroom teacher on staff who serves as our Teacher On 
Special Assignment  (TOSA).  This individual participates in ongoing training as an instructional coach 
and interventionist. 
Sessions cover a variety of topics including assessment, standards
-
based instruction, and specifics of the curriculum as 
well as individual instructional programs in place at our school site.  Our TK instructional aides and special edu
cation 
instructional aides participate in district
-
wide staff development with topics appropriate for their roles within the school. 
Our clerical staff also attend district
-
wide staff development sessions geared toward their particular duties. Individuals 
who fulfill other duties as site EL and GATE coordinators partake in specialized training. Our professional development for 
educators working with students with special needs includes monthly District
-
wide training, periodic training at the local 
SELPA, or
 
training on specific topics important to the classrooms. There are ongoing opportunities for collaboration with 
General Education teachers, and ongoing support and guidance from coordinators within the District. Instructional Aides 
and Behavioral Interven
tionist aides attend yearly training and ongoing professional development to support the students 
and the classroom teacher.
