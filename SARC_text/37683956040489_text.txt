By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The South
 
Bay Union School District sets a high priority on providing sufficient textbooks to support each school's 
instructional program. Adoptions are conducted on a six to eight year cycle by subject, in an effort to ensure textbooks 
are always current. All adop
ted textbooks and instructional material programs meet state standards and have been 
adopted by the State Board of Education and South Bay Union governing board.
 
 
The availability of sufficient state
-
adopted and standards
-
aligned textbooks for each pupil, 
including English learners, for 
use in class and to take home are consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum frameworks adopted by the 
California State Board of Education in all core curriculum areas.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
SCHOOL FACILITY CONDITIONS AND 
IMPROVEMENTS
 
Emory's enrollment is at student capacity. Security is bolstered by the presence of a security resident who lives on the 
property and inspects the property during nights and weekends to prevent vandalism and theft. In addition, surveillance 
ca
meras are located throughout the campus.
 
 
District Maintenance and Custodial staff take great care in ensuring that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. Lawns 
are mowed on Saturdays in an effort to minimize any classroom disturbances. Cleaning sche
dules are developed by the 
Principal and the Facilities Director to guarantee daily cleaning of campus. Restroom facilities are inspected three times a 
day by the Head Custodian to ensure they are fully stocked and in full working order. Any needed repairs
 
are addressed 
in a timely manner. Copies of inspections are available at the school and facilities offices.
 
 
The Head Custodian also performs a safety inspection on a monthly basis. The monthly report is submitted to the facilities 
office. Regular and pre
ventative maintenance is ongoing. The district employs a computerized online work order system 
for efficiency and better record keeping.
 
 
As per Education Code, the district is required to include in this document, a description of any needed maintenance t
o 
ensure good repair as specified in statute. "Good Repair" means the facility is maintained in a manner that assures that it 
is clean, safe, and functional as determined pursuant to a Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of 
California O
ffice of Public School Construction (OPSC). The FIT will evaluate the conditions at a school site with ratings of 
"good," "fair," or "poor." The FIT also provides an overall summary of the conditions at each school on a scale of 
"exemplary," "good," "fair,
" or "poor." The instrument shall not require capital enhancements beyond the standards to 
which the facility was designed and constructed.
 
 
SCHOOL FACILITIES GOOD REPAIR STATUS
 
Emory Elementary was built in 1937. The following table displays the results o
f the most recently completed school site 
inspection to determine the school facility's good repair status. The areas listed below, as in need of repair, are minor and
 
expected to be completed during winter break.
 
 
OVERALL SUMMARY OF SCHOOL FACILITY GOOD R
EPAIR STATUS
 
At the time of the above inspection on October 30, 2019, the average ranking for Emory Elementary was 93.26%, giving 
the school a rating of "Good." The rating is determined by the average of the 15 categories addressed above. Below are 
the per
centages, descriptions, and ratings, as per the Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT).
 
 
Please note that all needed repairs or deficiencies identified in the October FIT report have been completed and/or 
resolved.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Calif
ornia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: ELA and mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced S

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number 
of students who met the standard 
(i.e., 
achieved Level 3

lated by taking the total number of 
students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plu
s the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3
-
Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is te
n or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or 
not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

Based upon a survey of school data, parent, student and 
staff needs, the school site council and site leadership team 
determined the professional development focus for the Emory staff will include, but not be limited to a focus on balanced 
literacy pedagogy, student centered professional learning communities an
d positive behaviors interventions and supports. 
Emory teachers have numerous opportunities to participate in professional development. Prior to the school year starting, 
teachers have two days built in to their schedule. Throughout the year, 35 minimum da
ys and 1.5 hours per week are 
scheduled for professional development. Additionally, professional development is offered during school holidays, after 
school and on weekends. Staff participate in conferences within and outside the District, book clubs, and 
interactive 
lectures. District supported Teachers on Special Assignment and principal coach mentor during and outside the school 
day.
