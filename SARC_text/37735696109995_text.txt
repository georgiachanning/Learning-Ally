About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

School Safety Plan
 
School custodians ensure a clean and safe campus on a daily basis
 
and work collaboratively with district personnel to address site needs. We conduct 
monthly inspections of the playground.  Staff reviews emergency procedures at the beginning of each school year and engage in
 
practice drills with 
students each month.  The
 
campus is secured during the school day, and there is access only through the front office during school hours. The school 

 
 
We provid
e campus supervision before school, at recess and lunch. We also employ crossing guards before and after school.  Ongoing col
laboration with 
local police agencies supports with developing safe ingress and egress process.
 
 
We revise the Safe School Plan eve
ry spring and review it throughout the year with staff and parents. Our main goals are to continue training and 
practicing for crisis response and to ensure that the campus is secure. We also provide training for staff on bullying and co
nflict management. 
 
We use 
strategies found in the Second Step program, class meetings, and counseling services to support social
-
emotional development.  We work with families 
to connect them with outside resources to provide support for a variety of different needs if/when 
necessary.
 
 
School plans are reviewed by community, students, and staff in January to enhance clarity.
