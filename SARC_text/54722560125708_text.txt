By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Shannon Ranch Elementary School takes great efforts to ensure a safe, clean, and functional physical environment for 
students, staff, and volunteers. Sufficient 
space is provided for students and staff to support teaching and learning. This 
includes space provided by classrooms, playgrounds, and staff work rooms. To assist our school in this effort, the district 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the S
tate of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of 
this survey are available at the district office. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may b
e 
obtained by speaking with the school principal.

Maintena
nce and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
To date, there have been no major maintenance or repair projects at Shannon Ranch Elementary School.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
In addition to custodial staff on duty during the school day, a team of maintenance specialists
 
come in after hours for daily 
cleaning. District and school maintenance staff work cooperatively with administrators to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Program
 
The district participates in the State Scho
ol Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a 
dollar for dollar basis to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school build
ing 
components.  Typically, this includes roofing, plumbi
ng, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. The deferred maintenance program ensures that all class¬¨rooms and facilities are maintained 
to a degree of adequacy that allows for a good learning environ
ment.
 
 
Facilities Improvements
 
During winter break 2018, a gate in the front office was installed.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides 
the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for 
students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the admini
stration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successf
ully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

book fair, Cookies with Grinch, Art Night, Science Night, Literacy Night, Coffee 
with the Principal) attending school 
functions, participating in parent
-
teacher conferences, volunteering in classrooms, and chaperoning field trips.. Parents 
may also serve on advisory committees (School Site Council [SSC] and English Learners Advisory Co
mmittee [ELAC]) and 
leadership teams, including, but not limited to Positive Behavior Intervention and Support [PBIS] and with our PTA.  
Additional opportunities for parental involvement also exist at the district level.

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Shannon Ranch Elementary School. Campus
-
wide supervision ensures 
students are safe on school grounds before, during, and after school. Each aide on campus wears an orange vest so 
they 
are easily identified and carries a two
-
way radio. Entrances to school grounds are secured or monitored during the school 
day. All visitors must sign in at the office and wear appropriate identification while on campus.  Teachers have telephones 
in cl
assrooms as well as two
-
way radios as well.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is designed to assist in maintaining a safe school environment and preparing for 
emergencies. The plan requires identification of security needs, development of prevention an
d intervention techniques, 
evaluation of physical facilities, and communication with staff and students. The safety plan is reviewed annually 
(October), reviewed with the staff annually (October), updated as needed, and fully compliant with federal and sta
te 
regulations. An updated copy is available to the public at the school office.
 
 

preparedness drills are conducted regularly and the 
school staff is appropriately trained.  Fire drills are held monthly and 
lockdown drills are held quarterly.

chall
enge and in compliance with the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, Visalia Unified offers a robust 
support and training system for these novice educators including differentiated professional development and continuous 
professional growth oppo
rtunities.  The professional learning system begins with the New Certificated Staff Summer 
Institute which is a five
-
day interactive training offered in August one week before school begins.  This training covers 
classroom management, classroom culture, cu
rriculum frameworks, and lesson design. In addition, a four
-
day workshop 
on student engagement and cooperative learning is offered during winter break so that teachers may implement new 
structures and strategies during the spring semester.  All novice teac
hers receive ongoing support and individualized 
training throughout the year via weekly meetings with their assigned mentor at their respective school sites.  Mentors 
and district teachers
-
on

assignment support implementation of new knowledge by providing 
in
-
class coaching, 
collaborating on lesson design, accompanying novice teachers on classroom tours, and assisting with student data analysis 
to drive instructional decisions.  In addition, novice teachers and their mentors attend monthly after school train
ing in 
action research and are provided time to reflect on their instructional practice.   Mentors and teachers on assignment are 
carefully selected experienced educators trained in how to facilitate the individualized professional growth of novice 
teacher
s.  Novice teachers who have preliminary credentials participate in the VUSD Teacher Induction Clear Credential 
Program which is accredited by the Commission and is offered at no cost to the candidate.
 
 
Support for Veteran Teachers:  Veteran teachers in ne
ed of classroom management assistance also have access to one

one mentor support as may be needed in the case of a new grade level assignment or challenging class.  Visalia Unified 
also offers a Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) program which is a formal
 
system of mentoring and accountability.
