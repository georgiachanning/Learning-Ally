By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Poplar Avenue Elementary works diligently to ensure that our campus is clean, safe, and functional. District maintenance 
staff and site custodial staff ensure that the repairs necessary to keep the s
chool in good condition and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority. The principal works closely with the custodial staff to ensure t
hat all school facilities are kept 
clean and free of safety hazards. The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which 
provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist the school district with expenditur
es for major repair 
or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air 
conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. In the summer of 2018, a new playground 
system was purchased and installed. In September 2019, the Butte County Office of Education conducted a Williams Act 
Inspection of the school campus. Our facilities received an "Good" rating, and any deficiencies were immediately fixed.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There is a Thermalito District
-
wide Comprehensive School Safety Plan that is updated annually, pursuant to Education 
Code 32280 

 
32289. Our vision is to empower all stakeholders in order to 
create a safe and challenging environment 
where all students and staff can be safe and grow academically, socially, and emotionally. We will provide an environment 
which allows for the development of attitudes that promote healthful physical, social, acade
mic, and mental habits. This 
will be accomplished by encouraging pride in self achievement, respect and responsibility toward self and others, 
recognition of students and staff, and positive relationships with young people.
 
 
The key elements of the Safe Sc
hool Plan are the district Crisis Response Plan and a Safe School Section Plan. The action 
plan addresses two questions: 1) how can we improve our efforts in creating a caring and connected school climate and 
2) how can we improve our efforts in creating a
 
physical environment that communicates respect for learning and for 
individuals? The key elements of the District Crisis Response Plan are evacuation procedures, hostage crisis responses, 
loss of power and water, fallen aircraft, air quality alerts, chemi
cal spills, civil defense/disorder, drive
-
by shootings, bomb 
threats, fire emergency, imminent danger procedures (lock downs), and earthquakes. A copy of these procedures is 
available in the school office for your viewing. Student discipline is seen as opp
ortunities to learn new, more appropriate 
behaviors. When student misbehavior is a concern, staff works with students in making good choices, implementing 
appropriate consequences, and/or removing the student from a potential volatile situation. Positive r
ewards are given to 
students making good choices on a regular basis, including positive affirmations, special treats after lunch, class rewards, 
and "Pizza with the Principal".

Poplar 
A
venue School and the Thermalito Elementary Union School District are committed to providing supplemental 
services to our 
English Learners and other students falling below grade level in reading and math. We have several 
programs in place to support our students in order for them to be successful (funded by Title I and LCFF): Based on 
performance data in reading/language arts
 
and math, our Reading intervention teacher (along with classroom teachers) 
selects students for targeted intervention groups that meet daily for focused instruction. These groups are flexible, and 
change periodically according to assessment data and stude
nt needs. Small group instruction takes place throughout the 
school day. The Accelerated Reader Program (AR) 

we use this supplemental program encouraging independent 
reading at increasingly higher instructional levels using quizzes to assess comprehension
 
and vocabulary development. 
In addition to classroom teachers providing 'First Tap' of ELD Instruction to EL students, our EL Intervention teacher 
offers an English language support class for EL students performing at ELPAC levels 1

In 2017

2018 Poplar staff refined our Mission, Vision, Goals, and Collective Commitments to better tailor our professional 
development opportunities to our present and future needs. Our site has developed a guiding coalition of 
teachers to lead 
our development as we move forward in implementing a professional learning community model.  In 2017
-
2018, our 
district has added district wide Grade Level collaboration days to help develop and implement math and ELA common 
pacing and pla
nning guides as well as common formative assessments.  Those District wide days have continued into 2018
-
2019 and 2019
-
2020.  Based upon our newly revised goals and commitments, our site has also developed a plan for weekly 
professional learning community 
(PLC) collaboration time to target specific data and improve instructional practices.  Our 
Guiding Coalition pursued training in Trauma responsive Systems of Support to lead our site (and our district) into 
becoming more aware and more responsive to the ro
le trauma plays in both students and staff.
 
 
In 2018
-
19 TUESD hired a District Reading Specialist who is providing training to both classified (paraprofessionals) and 
certificated staff in the areas of dyslexia and dyslexia screening, guided reading techni
ques, Systematic Instruction in 
Phonics (SIPPS) and phonic/phonemic awareness instruction. The District Reading Specialist has also provided coaching 
support and developed targeted instructional practices to improve student achievement.  Poplar also contin
ued to provide 
regular weekly (PLC) collaboration time.  In the 2019
-
2020 school year Poplar added a full
-
time counselor to our staff, 
helping to support the social
-
emotional development of all our students and to help guide the Student Study Team process 
for struggling students.  Grade level teams continue their weekly PLC collaboration time, and have now committed to 
providing twice
-
weekly grade level interventions based upon the data reviewed at those weekly PLC meetings.  Our 
Student Social Supports tea
m is working closely with consultant Matt Reddam to help us target our next steps in becoming 
trauma responsive as well as how to measure our progress in this area.
 
 
The TUESD schedule provides 36 minimum days in order to provide teachers the time to colla
borate for the purpose of 
analyzing student assessment data, designing intervention groups, and planning for future instruction. Opportunities for 
peer support is built in to the grade level planning meetings as well as support from the principal via instr
uctional feedback 
and tailored professional development provided at staff meetings. Our guiding coalition examines best practices in utilizing 
this collaboration time and our student social supports team looks at how to best support the development of a sy
stematic 
social
-
emotional learning (SEL) curriculum.
