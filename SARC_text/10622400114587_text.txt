Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
 
Island Community Day School Vision:
 
Island Community Day School will serve as a pathway to empower students who have experienced some form of school 
challenge (academic, attendance, behavior, or social) in the general education setting.  We 
strive to provide the skills and 
supports students lack in an effort to successfully transitions them back to the general education seated program.
 
 
School Mission:
 
Island Community Day School will prepare students to successfully enter a traditional schoo
l setting and achieve their 
goals.
 
 
Island Community Day School has students from the Kingsburg Elementary Charter School District.  Island Community Day 
School faculty and staff believe in each of our student's potential to succeed!  We believe earning an
 
education is both 
their right and their responsibility.  Each student must do their part, as a student at Island Community Day School, to make 
this a reality.  Students are enrolled at Community Day School after a parent/student conference where alternati
ve 
education options are considered.  Referrals to Island Community Day School are the result of California Educational Code 
violations, late enrollment to the district without prior school attendance, or attendance problems at their home school.  
The leng
th of placement at CDS can range from 45 to 180 school days or as determined by the site administration.
 
 
Goals
 
1.
 
The Island Community Day School staff will continue to create a safe and warm environment for our students.
 
2.
 
The PBIS model school 
framework will be implemented to ensure our students are in a safe learning environment.
 
3.
 
Island Community Day School will be properly maintained to create a safe and warm learning environment.

Students visit a library on campus that houses hundreds of books to further enrich their 
academic experience.
 
 
Each student has a chromebook with internet capabilities.  Computer skills and concepts integrated throughout standard 
curriculum prepare students for technological growth and opportunities. Students are trained on google tools, 
keybo
arding programs as well as additional on

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Yea
r)
 
 
Island Community Day School was originally constructed in 1994. The campus is currently comprised of one classroom and 
a small office space.
 
 
Cleaning Process: The principal works with the custodial staff to ensure that the cleaning of the school is maintained to 
provide for a clean and safe school. The District Governing Board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the 
District. A su
mmary of these standards is available at the District Office for review.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and work orders are completed in a timely manner.
 
 
A work orde
r process (School Dude) is used to ensure efficient service and the highest priority are given to emergency 
repairs.
 
 
The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides State
-
matching funds on a 
dollar 
-
for
-
dollar ba
sis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school 
building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or 
exterior painting, and floor sy
stems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

meet as a team with the administrator, parent, student, teacher, and school staff from their prior placement.  During this 
meeting we go over our behavior contract, handbook, expectations, i
ncentives, and all other pertinent items.  Parents are 
welcome to come and participate and observe our classes.  In addition, a quarterly newsletter is sent home with 
information regarding academics, pbis, upcoming events, and opportunities.  Our staff est
ablishes strong connections with 
our families. They often text, call, email, and have face to face conversations.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Island Community Day School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. Safety of students 
and staff is a primary concern of Island Community Day School . The school is always in com
pliance with the laws, rules, 
and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and State earthquake standards. At the beginning of the year, the 
District Leadership team meets to review safety issues and administration does a safety walk each month. Key e
lements 
of the safety plan include identifying the level of threat, protective options, staff initial action/ response, incident 
coordinator, and incident management team.
 
 
Students are supervised throughout the day by teachers and paraproffessionals. King
sburg Elementary Charter School 
District encourages volunteers in the classroom, field trips, and with special projects. All school volunteers in direct cont
act 
with students are required to complete a District application form, provide evidence of a clear
 
tuberculosis (TB) screening, 

record check. Volunteers working more than 10 days per month will need to fill out additional forms and 
submit to 
fingerprinting.
