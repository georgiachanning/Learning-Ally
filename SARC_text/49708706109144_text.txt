By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Schaefer Charter School is a culturally diverse school that serves 340 kindergarten through sixth grad
e students. 75% 
percent of Schaefer Charter School students reside within the Piner
-
Olivet Union School District.  29% of students are 
English Language Learners, 60% Socio Economically Disadvantaged, and 1% Students with Disabilities.
 
 
Schaefer Charter Sch
ool has fifteen full classrooms, a STEAM lab, a music room, a multi
-
purpose room, a library, a field 
and a blacktop with play structures for student use. The kindergarten classrooms have their own separate, enclosed 
playground and eating area.
 
 
The staff a
t Schaefer includes a full time principal, a full time office manager, fifteen full
-
time teachers, and two custodians. 
All teachers are fully credentialed and highly qualified. Part
-
time staff includes 6 program assistants, a PE Technician, and 
a credentia
led music teacher. Nurse services are regularly available. Special programs include the Resource Specialist 
Program and Speech and Language Program (services provided through the Piner
-
Olivet Union School District) and the 
English Language Development (ELD
) and Intervention Program for students not meeting grade level standards (provided 
by the classroom teachers and program assistants). All students with intervention needs in English Language Arts and 
Math are served throughout the day in a Learning Center
 
as well as within their regular education classroom.
 
 
Curriculum is standards based and designed to be engaging. Teachers received professional development in the Common 
Core State Standards (CCSS) and utilize the CCSS as the basis for their classroom ins
truction. Technology is used to enhance 
instruction and increase student engagement. Classrooms are equipped with Chrome books and iPads. The technology in 
grades K
-
1 is at a  2:1 ratio, and in grades 2
-
6 at a 1:1 ratio.
 
 
Schaefer students demonstrate crea
tivity, initiative, leadership and innovation through their engagement with learning, 
interactions with staff, community, and each other. The Schaefer Student Leadership Council meets regularly to plan 
events and school
-
wide improvement efforts. Parents ar
e an integral part of Schaefer Charter School. We welcome 
volunteers to help in classrooms, on field trips, for special school activities, with planning student community service 
activities, and for other special tasks. Back to School Night, Open House, Mo
vie Nights, and special family events are well 
attended by our families.
 
 
Schaefer Charter School Mission:
 
We pride our school community on promoting a learning environment that empowers all students to reach their fullest 
potential. We are committed to 
creating a nurturing and caring environment that supports children in  their academic, 
emotional, social and creative growth.
 
 
Across the school community, adults and children behave in ways that demonstrate respect, safety and responsibility. 
These standa
rds for behavior are the basis of the norms that have been established for collaborative working relationships 
amongst staff and parents as well as classroom interactions between teachers and students. Everyone in the school 
community plays a vital role in
 
creating a caring and supportive learning environment for each student.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Safety, cleanliness and maintenance of facilities is a high priority at 
our school.  Classrooms are cleaned every other day, 
the Multi Purpose Room is cleaned every week.  Picnic tables where students eat lunch are cleaned daily.  Heavy cleaning 
of high traffic areas and classrooms occurs during school breaks.  A custodian is 
available throughout the school day to 
attend to emergency cleaning or repair issues.  Restrooms are cleaned on a daily basis.  We have one night custodian at 
the school.
 
 
The school is in good repair.  There are no gas leaks, all heating and air condition
ing systems are functioning at present.  
Ventilation is available in classrooms by opening windows or using the heating/air conditioning system and fan.  There are 
rarely power failures, and if there are, they are city
-
wide and corrected within 2
-
3 hours. 
 
There have never been any 
sewer line stoppages.
 
 
Over the past two years, Schaefer Charter School has been upgrading its heating/air conditioning units as well as re
-
roofing 
all of its main structures including classrooms, the multipurpose room and the of
fice. Two years ago, Schaefer installed a 
new solar system to reduce electricity costs.
 
 
There are no broken windows or exterior doors or gates that will not lock.  No hazardous materials are on the school site. 
Any structural damage is repaired in a timel
y fashion.
 
 
The school and district are in the process of addressing needs described in a facilities assessment completed early 2020.

Currently, the primary focus for professional development 
at Schaefer Charter School centers around Common Core 
English Language Arts and Math standards, and 21st century teaching, learning and assessment. The other area of school
-
wide focus has to do with developing a safe and positive school climate. All teache
rs and classified personnel have 
participated in Toolbox professional development and we are beginning a focus on Restorative Justice Practices. 
Professional development is delivered after school on early release days, during non
-
student workdays, during d
edicated 
days during summer, and by full and half day release days. Much professional development takes place in grade level team 
meetings. Teachers are supported by site and district administrators, district coaches, consultants, and district Director of
 
Innovative Learning. Teachers have professional development opportunities while attending STEAM Labs (NGSS) with their 
students and participating in poetry workshops delivered by California Poets in the Schools (CCSS ELA). Schaefer teachers 
attend grade sp
an and/or grade level meetings to assess and analyze student data and collaborate to plan instruction and 
intervention as well as determine needs for staff development. 
 
 
The district provides training based on identified goals for district staff which inc
lude:
 

 
Training to support adopted instructional materials (currently Bridges Math K
-
5 and Carnegie Math grade 6, 
Lucy Calkins Units of Study Writing grades K
-
6, Fountas and Pinnell Guided Reading)
 

 
Training to provide teachers with certification and skills 
necessary to work with English Language Learners
 

 
Teachers participate in regular district and grade level meetings
 

 
New teachers participate in the induction program through North Coast School of Education
 

 
Response to Intervention (RtI) and Multi
-
Tiered 
System of Supports (MTSS)
 

 
All teachers are participating in Bridges mathematics curriculum (K
-
5) and Carnegie Math (6)
 

 
Toolbox and Restorative Justice Practices Trainings
 

 
All teachers participate in Momentum in Teaching writing and balanced literacy coachi
ng and professional 
development program
 
Other professional development opportunities are considered on an individual basis or related to school / district priorities
 
and goals.
