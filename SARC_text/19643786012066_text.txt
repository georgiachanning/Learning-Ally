Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Cedargrove Elementary School is the largest elementary school in the Charter Oak Unified School District and is centrally 
located in the District. Current enrollment is 721 students. The school has twenty
-
six regular classrooms, two special day 
classrooms,
 
two special education pre
-
school classrooms, an ASD classroom, a library/media center, and four fully 
integrated GATE classrooms. In addition, Cedargrove has an intervention program where certificated teachers work with 
small groups of students within the
 
school day to improve their academic achievement. Cedargrove houses a district day 
care facility which offers before and after school child care on campus.
 
 
The majority of the school has undergone extensive modernization.  Classrooms, student restrooms, 
the administrative 
office, and library were modernized first. All classrooms, the administration offices, the library, and the multi
-
purpose 
room have HVAC systems installed.  The primary grade and Kindergarten playgrounds had new swings and rubberized pla
y 
surfaces installed.  The grounds are kept clean and in good repair. The only updating needed at this time is the upper 
grade restrooms. Future upgrades may include a multi
-
purpose media center and increased fencing which surrounds the 
campus.
 
 
Cedargrove
 
has remodeled and converted the existing computer lab into an Innovation Lab which will feature hands on 
collaborative building stations, application to classroom based coding instruction through robotics programming and 3D 
printing among other things.  I
n addition to this, a new computer lab is being fitted which will enable use for up to 40 
students.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud
y.

Cedargrove has a very active volunteer program. We have over 100 volunteers helping on our campus. Volunteers work 
in all classrooms from TK through sixth grade, and help is appreciated at each and every level. Volunteers play an important 
role at Cedargro
ve Elementary School. They provide needed services to individual children and small groups. They assist 
in preparing instructional materials and in the performance of routine duties. Our volunteers also provide enrichment of 
the school curriculum in areas 
requiring special talents, skills, or abilities (i.e., arts, crafts, music, technology, etc.). 

Our School Site Council and English L
earner Advisory Committee for second language families meets regularly. Community

n 

Committee meets regularly and makes safety inspections of facilities. 
The school disaster preparedness plan and safety procedures are reviewed with school staff at the start of every school 
year, and we participate annually in The Great California Shakeout
. Student safety is a priority, and we promote this in a 
variety of ways.
 
 
The Cedargrove School playground perimeter is securely fenced. The custodial crew examines the fence regularly and 
repairs any holes or breaks. Our principal and teachers include ag

-
appropriate instruction for every class, stressing things 
such as: 1)walking and riding bikes along roads in a safe manner; 2) being aware of situations involving strangers and 
having a proper response plan; 3)recognizing poison labels; and 4) saying NO 
to drugs and alcohol. Cleaning solvents and 
other toxic materials on this campus are kept in securely locked facilities when not in use.
