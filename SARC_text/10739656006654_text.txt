School Description
 
Herndon
-
Barstow Elementary School's Vision and Mission is aligned with the Central Unified School 
District's Guiding Principles.
 
 
Belief:  Every student can learn
 
Vision:  Every student is prepared for success in college, career, and community
 
Mission:  Every student will engage in rigorous, relevant, standards
-
based instruction in every 
classroom, eve
ry day, to ensure student learning
 
Core Values:  Character, leadership, innovation, and continuous Improvement
 
 
Herndon
-
Barstow (HB) Elementary School is located west of Highway 99 in northwest Fresno. It is 
part of the Central Unified School 
District. The school's population is currently 680 students, 52% 
of whom are socio
-
economically disadvantaged. Herndon
-
Barstow Elementary School houses many 
special populations. Fresno County Office of Education operates a severely emotionally disturbed 
cl
assroom and an autism classroom. These students range in age from kindergarten through sixth 
grade. The County also operates the Circles program for autistic students from kindergarten to 2nd 
grade. Central Unified has one State preschool program on the ca
mpus for four
-
year
-
olds, which 
serves two groups of twenty
-
four students. Herndon Barstow also houses Central Unified's 
Elementary Opportunity Program.
 
 
The School Plan for Student Achievement was created with the input of SSC, School Site Leadership, 
ELAC
, staff members, Student Council, and various other stakeholders. This input was extremely 
important as the categorical budget was formed to expend all of HB's funds: Title I Part A:  
Allocation; LCFF; and ASES funds. The current budget for Herndon
-
Barstow
 
Elementary School is 
very healthy and will be expended for the purpose of improving student achievement, building 
teacher capacity and providing support for our beliefs and behaviors to ensure that "every student 
is prepared for success in college, career
, and community" by ensuring that "every student will 
engage in rigorous, relevant, standards
-
based instruction in every classroom every day to ensure 
student learning". The goals identified in the School Plan were established after reviewing multiple 
meas
ures (ie. District Benchmarks, Fountas and Pinnell, Acadience, STAR and ST Math data). The 
data reflects the students' current performance levels, the current instructional practices of the 
teachers, and the beliefs and behaviors of our population and comm
unity. An in
-
depth analysis was 
made by reviewing various multiple measures to review the progress of the results of the significant 
subgroups, focusing specifically on the English Learner (EL), Foster Youth (FY), and Socio
-
Economically Disadvantaged (SED)
 
subgroup results in English Language Arts (ELA), and, 
Mathematics.  Herndon
-
Barstow continues to work hard to ensure that all targets are met to ensure 
academic improvement.
 
 
Our primary focus on staff development and professional growth is geared 
toward implementing 
"best first instruction." Instructional strategies include, but are not limited to, Common Core State 
Standards (CCSS) student engagement strategies, the 21st Century Skills, the 8 Math practices, 
Guided Reading, engaging students in ri
gorous, relevant, standards
-
based instruction, checking for 
understanding, using academic vocabulary, and the infusion of student technology. This will be 
accomplished using core materials and assessing students periodically for mastery.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of e
ach year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula
 
(LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local p
riorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, paren
ts/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Central Unified Schools maintain current and standards
-
aligned instructional materials in good rep
air, for all students. Materials are locally adopted and 
reflect programs currently approved by the State Board of Education. All materials currently adopted reflect the most recent 
SBE adoptions and support 
the current California Frameworks.
 
 
Every studen
t, including English Learners, Special Education, and other special populations have their own textbook. In the case of class
 
sets, those sets 
augment individual texts that have been issued to individual students. These class sets are made based on a commi
tment of the district administration 
and the governing board and are not the product of any state requirement.
 
 
All instructional materials are subject to a school and district review process. Materials may be piloted and all materials t
hat are 
selected and 
recommended for local adoption are reviewed by teachers, administration, and any parents who wish to review the materials. Th
e Central Unified Board 
of Trustees reviews and adopt based on the recommendation of the district adoption committees 
and Educational Services.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (Scho
ol Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parent volunteers are encouraged to be on campus or help from home as much as possible. Parents are cleared through the distr
ict
-
wide Raptor system 
and are fingerprinted when they volunteer for more than 20 hours in one year. The administr
ation encourages on
-
going communication with parents. 
The Parent Square platform is used by teachers and administrators to convey messages to the community, as well as weekly clas
sroom newsletters or 
Bloomz App, parent/teacher conferences, telephone contac
t, and Parent Portal to provide contact with the home. The school also utilizes flyers and 
notices to make important reminders via Peach jar on the site website and Xeroxed copies that are sent home. Parents particip

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension
 
rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The Site Emergency Response Plan has been prepared in compliance with Central Unified School District Governing Board Policy 
and California 
Administrati
ve Code, Title 5, California Education Section 560, which requires all public schools, kindergarten through community college
, to have written 
emergency response plans which will be reviewed at least annually by the local governing board.
 
 
The plan is devo
ted to the welfare and safety of the students of Herndon
-
Barstow Elementary School during school and after school program hours. It 
includes a procedure whereby the school could be used, under disaster conditions,  as a community resource for the care of p
eople.
 
 
The major objectives of emergency response procedures are to save lives and protect property in the event of a disaster. This
 
plan has been developed 
with these objectives in mind.  Drills are held on a regular basis.  Two
-
way radios and surveillan
ce cameras have been provided.
 
 
The plan is updated each year.  Revisions were completed in August 2019 and shared with the staff.  The plan includes all of 
the components required by 
the local, State and Federal Agencies in cooperation with Homeland Secur
ity and law enforcement.  In addition, items will be more comprehensive than 
in previous years.  Parents are made aware of the Site Emergency Response Plan during School Site Council, English Learner Ad
visory Council, Parent 
Teacher Association, staff meet
ings, and Parent Square.  A copy is on file for all to view in the front office of the school site.

meet multiple 
categories receive services as needed.
 
 
English Learners:
 
Students who are determined to be English learners are serviced in a pullout/push

the regular classroom utilizing the Universal Access materials.
 
 
A
