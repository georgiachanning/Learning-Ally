School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
El Camino Creek Elementary School provides a safe, clean 
environment for all students, staff and volunteers. The school 
facilities were built in 2000 and currently include the library, multi
-
purpose room, staff lounge, science lab, thirty
-
nine 
permanent classrooms, four portable classrooms, and two playgrounds. 
Improvements made in 2011
-
12: Replaced worn 
ramps to kindergarten cottages, all doors in the office building received new safety locks so as to be able to secure doors 
in an intruder incident, rooms 202 and 215 and the 500 building classrooms received safe
ty bars on doors, and the ECC 
garden area underwent a complete revitalization as a part of our Green Team work in 2012

13. In 2014, the garden area 
was expanded further, to include new shaded areas for studying and to allow for further experimentation beds
 
and 
planting.  In 2017, all classrooms, offie and MPR received new carpeting.
 
 
District maintenance supervisors are proactive and conduct inspections at school sites on a continual basis. Repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working ord
er are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. District maintenance has 
indicated that 100% of all toilets on school grounds are in working order.
 
 
Al
l schools within the Encinitas Union School District will have various site upgrades during the next 3
-
5 years based on 
the Capital Facilities and Technology Plan submitted as a component of Proposition P that was passed by the voters in 
November 2010.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-

Maintaining a safe and orderly environment is essential to learning. The Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP) is 
developed by El Camino Creek Elementary in consultation with local law enforcement/Emergency Preparedness staff, 
School Site Council (SSC) a
nd Administrative Services in order to comply with Senate Bill 187. It was most recently updated 
and reviewed in September 2019 and accepted by the Board of Trustees in November 2019.
 
 
The CSSP includes elements such as emergency plans and procedures, incl
uding the Run, Hide, Fight Model, the School 
Protection Evacuation Plan for Wildfire, school rules and school dress codes. Fire drills are conducted monthly, earthquake 
drills are held four times a year, and two lockdown exercise drills are practiced each 
year. All schools in the district are 
closed campuses, and visitors must immediately register in the school office before entering the campus. School access is 
monitored by administrators, teachers and other school staff.
