By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
 
MISSION STATEMENT
 
Skycrest participated in a comprehensive strategic planning process during the winter and spring of 2011. A diverse group 
of staff, parents, and community members developed the following mission statement that was 
formally adopted by 
Skycrest Site Council in May of 2011. In October 2013, the Strategic Planning Team reconvened to review the progress of 
the School Strategic Plan. Recommendations for change were made with Action Teams reconvening in January 2014 to 
rev
iew the tactics. The Strategic Planning team and Skycrest staff reviewed the data from the Action Teams in May 2014 
and information was brought to the School Site Council in September 2014.
 
 
The mission of Skycrest Elementary School, valuing academic excel
lence, positive character development, and diversity, 
is to inspire every student to responsibly contribute to an ever
-
changing world by engaging in an innovative curriculum 

t in partnership with families, school, 
and community.
 
 
SCHOOL PROFILE
 
Skycrest Elementary is one of 41 elementary/K
-
8 schools in the San Juan Unified School District. The curriculum provided 
is aligned to the Common Core State Standards. Staff at Skycrest
 
implement the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) in 
their teaching and in designing and establishing their daily lessons. The school supports cultural awareness on a daily basis
 
through its diverse literature selections and other school activities. Throug
h our character education program, Skycrest 
places a heavy focus on establishing students with strong, positive character traits. Grade levels present at each assembly, 
focusing on one of the specific traits. Monthly character assemblies are held with stud
ents recognized for demonstrating 
these traits every day.
 
 
Skycrest has a BRIDGES After
-
School program that is funded by the 21st Century Grant and ASSETS. This program provides 
after school enrichment, homework completion time, structured physical educati
on games, and parent activities. The 
BRIDGES program is offered at low cost to families. 
 
 
To support our English Learner students, Designated English Language Development (D
-
ELD) is planned daily, with 
students receiving support in their designated groups: expanding, emerging, bridging and enriching. All teachers within 
each grade level provide
 
D
-
ELD and integrated ELD strategies in all core content areas throughout the day. 
 
 
The focus for our professional learning cycle this school year will be focused around Math 
-
 
critical thinking and problem 
solving. We will also work to support writing th
at is aligned with student's text level of reading.

An emphasis of incorporating grade level standards and increasing of the Depth of Knowledge (DOK) rigor that is presented 
within each class and throughout the grade level will be included as work around
 
these areas. Designated English Language 
Development (ELD) is scheduled for all grade levels with English Learners (ELs) placed in groups to support them at their 
English Language level. Further collaboration days around Writing and Math are planned to su
pport students in writing 
throughout the day and throughout all curricula areas and to support students in both a conceptual and procedural 
understanding of math. Data release days are scheduled around guided reading, running records, text levels, and writ
ing 
with a focus around common understanding and norms throughout each grade level. Release days are scheduled around 
math that will include coaching and learning about specific targeted areas in math. The California Assessment of Student 
Performance and P
rogress (CAASPP) data shows that focus on increased language development is necessary for all 
students
--
both English Learners (ELs) and English Only (EO) students. With approximately 45% of our students population 
being English Learners, it is our top prio
rity to increase vocabulary acquisition and oral language for all students. Continued 
professional development will be presented to support teachers in using strategies and techniques that will support all 
students in the area writing and math.

Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current availa
ble. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at t
he district office prior 
to adoption. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the quality, currency, and availability of

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Skycrest Elementary was modernized during the 1999
-
2000 school year. The scope included 
roof/repair or replacement, 
interior and exterior painting, window system replacement, energy
-
efficient lighting, heating and cooling system upgrade, 
new doors with handicapped accessible hardware, restroom restoration, electrical infrastructure upgrade to
 
provide for 
internet, cable, telephone, new fire, intrusion and intercom system throughout the school. Classrooms were carpeted at 
that time and were upgraded again for the 2004
-
2005 school year. In 2006 Skycrest had an additional wing built. This 
allowed
 
Skycrest to replace portable classrooms with 8 new classrooms. In summer 2008 the parking lot and hard
-
court 
was overlaid, ADA sidewalk and Safe Route upgrades and a complete landscape & irrigation project were completed 
funded through Measure
-
J Bond.  Du
ring the spring of 2009 Skycrest's exterior was repainted. Summer 2011 our parking 
lot was made safer for students with the addition of a sidewalk around the perimeter of the front parking lot. This allows 
us to control pedestrian traffic so no one has to 
cross through traffic to walk to the front of our school.
 
 
During the spring of 2011 Skycrest received a grant and  became one of the only schools in Northern California with a 
diverse fruit orchard. Our Community Orchard was planted with 27 fruit trees th
at offer a wide variety of fruit that will 
ripen during the school year. These trees are watered through an automated system installed using the grant funds. In 
addition to the fruit orchard, the Sacramento Tree Foundation sponsored a tree planting day on 
campus. 55 additional 
shade trees were planted throughout the campus.
 
 
The Board of Education and the Superintendent's policy is to ensure that all students are provided with a safe and well
-
maintained learning environment. The board approved resolutions i
n 1998 and 2002 to adequately fund maintenance 
activities and preserve the repairs and improvements funded by two facility bond measures. The school buildings, 
classrooms and grounds are safe, clean and functional. An inspection of the facility was conduct
ed in August 2019 and 
determined that there were no unsafe conditions that required emergency repairs. District maintenance staff ensures 
that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
com
puter automated work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs and health and 
safety repairs are given the highest priority. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards and custodial staffing 
requirements for al
l schools in the district. This school meets the Board's standards for custodial staffing and cleanliness. 
The school's custodians are trained in the proper use of cleaning chemicals and Integrated Pest Management techniques. 
They are managed day to day by
 
the Principal with assistance from the district's maintenance department. The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, with funding allocated for major repair or replacement 
of existing school building components. Typically,
 
this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.Annually the district budgets $2 million dollars for deferred 
maintenance activities.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., 
California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/
literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California St
ate University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) and the School Parental Involvement Policy to en
sure that academic needs for all students 
are met and that parents and the community have an opportunity to voice their concerns. School Site Council meeting 
will be held five times during the school year to modify the School Plan for Student Achievement i

a Community Safety Specialist assigned to this school within a geographic zone that includes nearby schools. In addition, 
via a part


school. The Deputy Sherif
fs are assigned to patrol a geographic zone either on the east side of the district or the west side 
of the district. They are assigned specific schools within their assigned zone and respond to this school, or others, as safe
ty 
needs dictate. The two CHPD
 
Police Officers are School Resource Officers (SRO) who work identified schools within the 
City of Citrus Heights and respond as safety needs dictate. The two law enforcement agencies will overlap response when 

fficers are dispatched to critical incidents via the Safe Schools Dispatcher, 
a law enforcement dispatcher or via a direct report from a school staff member, school visitor or other person. This school 
has a school safety team which reviews safety matters 
that may affect the campus. Our school safety team meets regularly 
to discuss safety issues, update our site emergency plan, and to take steps to be proactive in preventing various types of 
school
-
related safety issues. Community Safety Specialists and law
 
enforcement provides speakers to address students, 
staff and community groups on matters of school safety. Our safety team receives training, when requested, from Safe 
Schools or law enforcement. This school is responsible for updating our Comprehensive S
chool Safety Plan (CSSP) by March 
1st of every year per the Education Code. As part of the update, this school meets at least once per year with a law 
enforcement officer to review the CSSP, has the local fire department review the CSSP and we hold a commu
nity meeting 
to review the CSSP. The CSSP must be approved by the School Site Council before being submitted to the district safe 

site sp
ecific crisis response procedures and a district standardized emergency flip chart. This school conducts and keeps a 
record of all fire drills, lockdown drills, shelter in place drills and/or earthquake drills up to or in excess of what is re
quired 
by the 
Education Code.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and 
Continuous Improvement

Professional development is a key part of the continuous improvement process for educators. The goal of our quality 
professional development is to support the learning of teachers and paraprofessionals to positively impact student 
achievement.  Annually, t
eachers and site administrators participate in professional development in a variety of 
opportunities.  Seventy
-
five minutes per week are dedicated to staff collaboration and training planned by site leadership 
teams. The District also provides a cycle of 
continuous professional development for Administrators through Principal 
Networks as well as Leadership Academies.
 
 
The District provides professional development opportunities for teachers and administrators that support the 
implementation of Common Core 
State Standards in English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and the 
ELA/ELD Framework.  Specific professional development initiatives include: Culturally Responsive Practices, Critical 
Literacy, TK
-
2 Reading, Supporting Independence and
 
Engagement through Reading and Writing, Math to the Core, 
Expository Reading and Writing Course, and ELD Foundations.  District departments, Center for Teacher Support, grant
-

ing opportunities.  Professional 
development opportunities are voluntary for teachers and are provided throughout the year in a variety of formats: during 
the school day, after school, on Saturdays, and during summer and vacation breaks. Many teachers and 
administrators 
also take advantage of opportunities with Sacramento County Office of Education, California Department of Education, 
the college/university programs, state/national education organizations, and private educational institutes.
 
 
What grounds t
he professional development in the district is the District Strategic Plan and the Local Control 
Accountability Plan. Professional Development is further determined using one or more of the following: (a) student 
achievement data, (b) staff survey data, an
d (c) district
-
identified goals.  Professional development addresses the Common 
Core State Standards, teaching strategies, curriculum, assessment, technology, classroom management, safety, and 
leadership. Administrator training accompanies professional dev
elopment in district focus areas, providing 
implementation support for teachers on site.  Content
-
area coaches are available at some schools.  Additional classroom 
support is provided to new and struggling teachers by consulting teachers from the Center fo
r Teacher Support.
 
 
Paraprofessionals are encouraged to participate in professional development at the district and site level.  Specifically 
designed training is also offered to non
-
instructional support staff such as clerical and custodial staff that inc
ludes both 
operational and instructional topics.
