School Description
 
North Ridge Elementary School is a TK
-
5 magnet elementary school that was recognized in 2010 as 
a California Distinguished School for our outstanding efforts in increasing student achievement and 
in closing the achievement gap. North Ridge was also awarded
 
the distinction of being an Honor 
Roll School by the California Business for Education Coalition.
 
 
High expectations, a commitment to faithfully teaching the Common Core State Standards and 
exemplary parent support provide a strong base for our instructio
nal program. Our parent groups; 
Booster Club, AAPAC, and ELAC assist in providing assemblies, field trips, and family activities that 
help connect students to their learning that goes beyond the classroom.
 
 
Our Vision for North Ridge Elementary School is t
o work cooperatively as staff, students, parents, 
and community to provide a safe and positive environment; recognizing the uniqueness of all. Our 
commitment is to provide a challenging STEAM curriculum while encouraging continuous learning 
and developing 
responsible citizens for the 21st Century through career and college readiness.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is 
not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated
 
using only students who received scores.

Our ability to be successful as a school is directly related to our strong school and community partnership. As the basis for
 
this strength, North Ridge 
Elementary School has incorporated the 3R's Compact, which e
mphasizes rights, responsibilities, and respect for the individual. Our Compact is founded 
on the premise that all of the adults of the greater school community must commit to model personal behavior appropriate in a
 
diverse society. In 
addition, the Six P
illars of Character 
-
 
Be A Person of Character is a consistent focus throughout the campus and are infused into the school's discipline 
plan. Parents enrich and enhance our instructional program through the School Site Council (SSC), Booster Club, AAPAC (A
frican American Parent Advisory 
Council) and ELAC (English Language Advisory Committee).
 
 
The School Site Council (SSC) and Local Control Accountability Plan Review Team (LCAP) strengthens parent participation by pr
oviding a forum for input 
on matters affe
cting aspects of the instructional program such as curriculum, budget, support programs, special services, and needs.
 
 
A strong Booster Club supports our efforts to strengthen the areas of math, science, technology, and school community by prov
iding additi
onal funding, 
parent in
-
services, and special family events such as Grandparents Day, Red Ribbon Week, School Spirit Assemblies, Harvest Festival and
 
Jump to Junior 
High. They also provide equipment for special projects. Community involvement is further ev
idenced by support from area businesses and civic 
organizations in academic programs and student recognition activities.
 
 
Our English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) and African American Parent Advisory Council (AAPAC) provides a forum for ongo
ing commu
nication 
with parents representing our multi
-
lingual and multi
-
ethnic community. Their advice and support helps to strengthen our English Learner program and 
bring cultural aspects to our school community.
 
 
North Ridge Elementary has community partnerships
 
with several local businesses: Shakey's Pizza, Morning Optimist Club of Moreno Valley, Horace 
Mann Insurance Company, Taylor Martial Arts, and Altura Credit Union.These community partnerships promote: academic achieveme
nt, attendance and 
positive behavior
