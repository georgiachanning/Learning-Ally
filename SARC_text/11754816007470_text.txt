By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

teachers and 1 full
-
time ELD coordinator, one library, one music room, and one cafeteria/multi
-
purpose room. In the 2018
-
2019 school year, we became a 1:1 school, with all students having access to a state of the art Chromebook.  In addition, 
a 3rd g
rade Dual Immersion class was implemented for the 2019
-
2020 school year, with plans to continue the DI program 
over the next couple of school years to have DI classes in grades 3
-
5 at Fariview.  Due to our high population of Spanish 
speaking families, we h
ave on staff a dedicated bilingual services aide to assist with written and verbal translation.  All of 
the staff at Fairview Elementary School are highly qualified and have a diverse range of training and experience to work 
with our student population.  W
e strive to create an educational environment that is both safe and stimulating while 
reaching to help our students achieve personal and academic success. We are working to improve our communication 
and collaboration with our families to create a well

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
October 2019
 
 
Panels of scholars have decided what 
California students should learn and be able to do. Their decisions are known as the 
Common Core State Standards and they apply to all public schools in the state. The textbooks we use and the tests we 
give are based on these content standards and we expec
t our teachers to be firmly focused on them. Policy experts, 
researchers, and educators consider our state's standards to be among the most rigorous and challenging in the nation. 
You can find the content standards for each subject at each grade level on t
he web site of the California Department of 
Education (CDE).
 
 
Reading and Writing
 

-
length books and to use a dictionary and encycloped
ia when they write. By fifth grade, students should be able to write 
poems, plays, true
-
life adventures, and personal journals. You can read the California Common Core State Standards for 
English/language arts for first grade, second grade, third grade, fo

adopted a new State approved curriculum called Benchmark Advanced.  All teachers have had training in the 
implementation of the program and eight teachers have attended Trainer of Trainers training in t
he program to help 
support the school.
 
 
Math
 
Because the math standards have become
 
more rigorous, our goal now is to prepare our elementary school graduates to 
have a deeper knowledge of math concepts.  We have adopted the Go Math program. Teachers have been trained on the 
how the programs works so we can work meet Common Core Math Stan
dards.   Common Core Math is a whole new way 
of teaching and learning that helps students to find their personal strengths in math and then using those strengths to 
their greatest advantage.  You can read the math standards for first grade, second grade, t
hird grade, fourth grade, and 

 
 
Science
 
Students learn the Next Generation Science Standards starting in kindergarten. The curriculum covers physical, earth, and 
life sciences. The scientific method of experimentation and 
investigation is woven through all of our science courses. Read 

Web site.  The new State Science Test was fully operational in the 2018
-
2019 school year for 5th grade students.
 
 
Social Science
 
Students learn about citizenship starting in first grade. In second grade, we explore the lives of people who affect our 

e theme in third grade is continuity and 
change. California is the subject of our studies in fourth grade, and American history is our focus in fifth grade. Our stude
nts 
also learn about geography. They learn to research topics on their own, develop their 
own point of view, and interpret 
history. To read more about the social studies standards for first grade, second grade, third grade, fourth grade, and fifth 

 
 
Textbooks
 
We choose our textbooks from the most recent list of sta
ndards
-
based materials adopted by the SBE.  Teams of teacher 
and administrators meet to research and recommend the best choice for our community of learners.  Our local school 
board makes the final textbook decisions based on input from teachers, administr
ators, and community members.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
District maintenance staff keeps the grounds and facilities in excellent condition.  Site custodians clean both classrooms 
and bathrooms daily.  Fairview Elementary recently reconfigured it's office space creating a new entrance.  This new 
configuration ma
kes it so any visitors must enter the school through one main entrance thus providing a safe watch on 
who is coming and going during the school day.  We are hoping that soon the school will be repainted which is needed.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the 
California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parent Involvement
 
Our 
School Site Plan and all categorical budget approvals are made by our SSC, which always includes parent members. In 
addition, we have an English Language Advisory Committee to help parents of students learning English feel welcome at 
our school and keep th
em informed of vital information of our school direction and activities. The ELAC meets four times 
a year and dates can be attained by calling the school.  Our Parent Club meets the first Wednesday of the month at 7 pm 
at Round Table Pizza.  They support t
he school and students by raising  funds for student activities by coordinating Western 
Night, Santa's' Workshop, Spring Fiesta, book fairs, picture days, staff appreciation events, in
-
class support, and school 
assemblies.  Fairview holds an annual Title 1
 
meeting at the beginning of the school year as a part of Back To School Night, 
to inform parents of services provided to children participating in the Title 1 programs, which include reading, language, 
and math intervention groups.  Parents are also kept 
up to date of events and activities, and encouraged to participate, 
through our weekly bulletin, marquee, website, social media, and an auto
-
dialer.  Coffee with the Principal is held four 
times throughout the year as an opportunity for parents to connect 
with the principal on an informal level and network 
with other parents.
 
 
Please contact the school office at (530) 865
-
1235 if you are interested in becoming involved at our school.
 
 
Homework
 
Teachers at our site include homework as a part of the learning 
process.  We ask that all parents read information from 
teachers about individual classroom homework policies and expectations and then work with the classroom teacher to 
ensure that this important part of the process has help both from school and from hom
e.  Our fall open house is an 
important time for parents to find out about their child's classroom and how they can best support the educational 
process.  In addition, most of our teachers require students to read for at least 20 to 30 minutes each evening
. We also 
ask parents to read with or to their child and to sign a reading log and return it weekly.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The school safety plan has been reviewed on an ongoing basis and finalized by the School Site Council.  It was last revised 
in May of 2019. Elements of this plan has been an agenda item of discussion at the first 
staff meeting of the year and a 
finalized copy of the plan is placed in each staff member's staff binder. Revised sections are also replaced in the emergency
 
flip charts that are located in each room near the door. Our site has a monthly fire drill, with a
n earthquake and intruder 
drill twice a year.  The plan will be communicated to parents through the student handbook and an annual school survey 
will be done looking for potential hazards.  We currently have a plan in place for fire, earthquake, intruder, 
bomb threat, 
chemical/toxic spill and a post
-
death intervention plan.  All plans, including an evacuation plan, will be distributed and 
displayed in all classrooms in a highly visible area.
 
 
School Climate: We have a school
-
wide program that is based on Po
sitive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) 
framework. Staff, parents, students, administrators, and board members have worked closely together to support and 
advocate for PBIS in all Orland Unified School District schools. This handbook was develope
d, so its contents match the 
principles of PBIS in a way that fits the goals, mission, and culture of Fairview School.
 
 
School
-
wide PBIS is a research
-
based framework that has been proven to improve school climate, reduce problem 
behavior, and increase aca
demic instructional time in schools (for additional information go to www.pbis.org). Two 
primary areas of emphasis in PBIS are prevention and instruction of social behavior. PBIS is based on the idea that when 
students are taught clearly defined behavioral
 
expectations and provided with predictable responses to their behavior, 
both positive and corrective, all students are more likely to meet those expectations.
 
 
Collaboratively, our staff and students have developed school
-
wide procedures to accomplish a p
ositive and safe 
environment.
 
 
Additionally, in 2019
-
2020, OUSD has systematized and upgraded its two
-
way radio communications to include a district 
and city
-
wide scan so that all school employees and administration with a two
-
way radio can 
communicate on a secured 
network.

The District provides two optional Professional 
Development Days for all teachers outside of the instructional student 
days, one mandatory day and 3
-
4 Banking days a year.  Topics for professional development have been around high
-
quality 
instruction and second language learners.  These areas have been 
determined by the District with input from teachers 
based on student data.
 
 
2017
-
18 Professional Development offerings were set to continue our learning in high
-
quality instruction, supporting our 
English Learners and effective use of technology in the cla
ssroom.  Teachers could attend a full day training about the new 
ELPAC and the skills needed to perform well on that test, they could attend a full day training on technology (teachers 
could pick from over twenty 1.5 hr workshops), and Tk
-
5 teachers could 
attend a full day training on Benchmark Advance 
while secondary focused on Long
-
term English Learners.  Banking Days for the year are focusing on more technology 
sessions and Long
-
Term English Learners supports.
 
 
2018
-
19 Staff development time was spent fo
cusing on English Learner needs and strategies, increasing technology use in 
the in the classroom, along with core curriculum supports.  All teachers had the opportunity to participate in a District 
Wide Technology day where they could choose between sever
al offering every two hours.  This allowed them to get 
specific supports in what they were looking for. Secondary teachers worked two days with Storm Writing and focused on 
LTEL needs and strategies for improving writing and vocabulary development. There w
as a follow
-
up session in December 
for those interested and time during our District Banking day to further their knowledge on DOK questions.  Our 
elementary teachers had time to work with their core materials in math and ELA.  In addition to this, they co
uld get support 
in GLAD strategies and STEM.  District Banking Days were spent looking at EL data and looking at vocabulary development.
 
Additional PD was offered, during the school year, to some teachers in math, science, Illuminate and CAASPP instruction
al 
resources.

UP Days.  During this 
professional development time teachers could choose sessions based on their need, interest and subject. Breakout session 
foc
used on increasing student academic talk, English Learner needs and strategies, increasing technology use in the 
classroom, learning more about Social Emotional Learning and supports we can provide in the classroom, along with core 
content supports.  Profe
ssional Development days were set up to focus on iReady training and math through Chico State 
with Katy Early.  The first iReady training was in October and focused on looking at the 1st diagnostic results and 
understanding the data.  Another round of trai
ning is set for after the 2nd diagnostic around the end of the 2nd trimester.  
The focus will be to look at student data and determine the use and effectiveness for Growth Monitoring, Teacher Toolbox, 
and Instructional Minutes.  In addition to this, as a D
istrict, we have contracted with outside resources to support our 
math teachers. Each site has 3
-
4 release days this year to work as a site with consultants to increase their math strategies 
tool box, deepen their understanding of common core math, and cha
llenge their mind set around math to better relate 
to the hurdles their students are facing daily. The math PD is set up in 3 sets of dates, which allows a full day and 2 half 
days for each grade level.  Teachers have input on what they will focus on based
 
on current pacing and grade level essential 
standards.  In addition to iReady and the math PD days, teachers used their Banking Days to focus on SEL strategies and 
best practices, as well as STAR Reading levels/data and iReady usage.  Some of the days hav
e also been used to develop 
math and EL strategies and lessons based on current benchmark assessments, iReady data, and STAR data.  We also have 
different focus team groups in the district and many of them are attending conferences to deepen their knowledg
e and 
gain more usefully strategies to share with their school sites.   Some of these conferences are Restorative Justice training,
 
2020 California Student Mental Wellness Conference, 2020 CABE and Illuminate.
