School 
Description
 
Mission Statement:  Bay View School is a safe and welcoming community where everyone is 
respected, and learning is valued. Our school is a dynamic learning environment where everyone is 
engaged and inspired to do their personal best. Our rich a
cademic curriculum includes the arts, 
field trips, library, Life Lab, nutrition, and music. Diversity is embraced; it enriches our learning 
community. Students, families and staff work together as a team to ensure academic success and 
social responsibility
 
for everyone.
 
At Bay View School, Everybody is Somebody.
 
 
A Message from the Principal
 
 
At Bay View Elementary School, we provide a safe and nurturing environment that fosters life
-
long 
learning. Bay View is dedicated to academic excellence. We value pare
nts and community members 
as partners in education.
 
By continually supporting social
-
emotional learning, through Second Step Curriculum and explicitly 
teaching Bay View Life Skills, we prepare students to become responsible citizens in our diverse 
society.

achievements, and accomplishments. We continue to offer an excellent early exit bilingual 
Spanish/English program, called Puentes, for students in kindergarten through third grade. A rich 
mixture of languages and backgrounds among 
our community allows us to build on our diversity.
 
 
Significant Achievements
 
Bay View staff is committed to monitoring student progress by analyzing and responding to reading 
and math scores on assessments, such as, Fountas and Pinnell Reading Inventory, N
WEA district 
math and literacy benchmark assessments, and teacher developed formative assessments.  In 
2018
-
2019 we were in our eighth year of implementation of a school
-
wide Walk to Read program, 
in which students were grouped with peers for reading instr
uction four times a week. We offered 
high
-
quality researched
-
based small group reading intervention instruction to support students 
who were below grade level and high
-
quality enrichment and extension activities for those who 
were at or above. Our literacy
 
intervention program includes explicit phonics instruction using 
Systematic Instruction in Phonological Awareness, Phonics, and Sight Words (SIPPS) and Reading 
Intervention for Students to Excel (RISE) based on Jan Richardson's guided reading framework.
 
 
 
Focus on Improvements
 
Improvement goals based on staff input and data analysis. The 2018
-
19 goals include the following:
 
1.  Improve reading comprehension for all kinder through fifth
-
grade students. Reading 
comprehension is being measured by NWEA distric
t benchmark assessments (K
-
5) and Fountas and 
Pinnell Reading Inventory.
 
2.  Have 80 percent of all kinder through fifth graders score at grade
-
level in reading, as measured 

 
3.  Have 80 percent of all kinder through fifth grade score at grade
-
level in math, as measured by 
the district's math assessment.

Language 
Development. Teachers continue to collaborate in their Professional Learning Communities.
 
5. Continue to implement Second Step, a universal social skills curriculum, to be taught in the classroom and supported by ou
r elementary 
counselor and staff.
 
6.  Imp
rove School Climate and Student engagement with the implementation of Playworks, a recess coaching, and student leadership 
program.
 
7. Continue implementation of PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention Support), our school
-
wide positive behavior system.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the cond
ition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
ann
ual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the Cal
ifornia 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Bay View Elementary campus sits on a 5 acre lot and is located at the intersection of Bay Street and Mission Street (HWY 1). 
The school was built in the 
1940s and expanded until present. All classrooms
 
are spacious and well lit. In addition to 27 classrooms, we have an art room, a music room, a life lab, 
and a large library media center. The play structure was resurfaced with new soft padding using funds provided by money from 
bond money. Additional 
imp
rovements that are expected to be completed using bond money include replacing portable classrooms with permanant buildings, 
upgrading 
technological infrastructure, improving the play area, modernizing classrooms, and constructing a new multi

School Safety Plan
 
Our School Safety Plan is updated annually. Our school and grounds are very safe. We recently resurfaced the flo
or in the play structure area.  We have 
lockable fencing in all four entrances, and those gates are locked during school hours. School Site Council (SSC) and staff u
pdate and approve our plan 
annually. Parents are informed about emergency procedures, and a
 
list of procedures is visible in every classroom. Emergency procedures provide 
detailed directions and maps for fire, earthquake, and evacuation drills, and stranger

on
-
campus lockdown procedures.  This year the staff received a 
Code Red training from the
 
Santa Cruz Police Department.
 
The staff receives monthly five

minute safety  meetings. The staff also received in
-
depth training in emergency response procedures, mandate reporting, 
harassment and discrimination, and FERPA (Family Educational Rights and P
rivacy Act).  The school safety team meets regularly to review and update 
the site safety plan.

At Bay View Elementary School, we believe that Professional Learning opportunities are essential to ensure that every student
 
has teachers who are 
prepared to teach to the rigor and depth required by the CA Common Core Standards.  This year our school will
 
focus on closing the opportunity gap for 
underserved students in English Language Arts (ELA) by concentrating on improving designated and integrated English Language 
Development (ELD) 
instruction.
 
Research shows a strong correlation between Collective Tea
cher Efficacy and Student Success.  At Bay View Elementary, we see a pattern of stagnant 
academic achievement when looking at overall school achievement in ELA.  Sadly, in 2017
-
2018, only 45% of Bay View students in Grades 3
-
5 tested in 
the met or exceeded
 
grade level proficiency range on the CAASPP ELA exam.  As such, more than half of our students are not reading at grade level
.  
When analyzing student cohort groups over time we see significant decline in student achievement in ELA.   We also see a huge

English Language Learner (ELL) students and English proficient students with almost no ELLs achieving grade level proficiency

ELL students and develop action research plans to address their unique learning needs.  Our 2018
-

expanding our existing dist

-
wide Professional Learning Communities (PLC) model and fine tuning our site Response to Intervention (RTI) system.
 
Our meeting structures are as follows:
 
We will use the monthly district
-
wide English Language Development (ELD) Professional development
 
sessions (early release days) to inform our site 
work by introducing staff to data analysis protocols developed by the National Equity Project and spending time unpacking ELA
 
and ELD standards and 
determining the implications for instruction.
 
We will meet
 
three times a year for full day (sub
-
release) Student Learning Team (SLT) meetings to identify priority ELA and ELD standards and develop 
student goals.  We will refine our progress monitoring system by determining which common summative and formative ass
essments will be used to 
evaluate student progress.  We will analyze our most current ELA/ELD student achievement data and create a comprehensive acti
on plan to address the 
needs of students at each proficiency band.
 
We will meet bi
-
monthly in grade level 
PLCs to analyze student work collected using common formative assessments to determine which instructional 
practices are yielding the best results.
 
We meet twice a month for staff meetings which include teachers and all certificated support staff.  Here we
 
engage in school
-
wide data analysis and 
engage in cross
-
grade level collaboration around grade level action plans.  We are striving to build more vertical alignment.
 
We augmented our professional learning capacity by providing additional training to teach
er leaders at our school.   We provided sub
-
release training 
days during the school year and provided summer training opportunities to teacher leaders willing to share their learnings wi
th peers.  Additional training 
included:  sending several teacher lead
ers to Columbia Teachers College Summer Writing Institute, Balanced Literacy Training provided by Momentum, 
Lawrence Hall of Science Next Generation Science Standards/English Language Development (NGSS/ELD) training, and Silicon Vall
ey Math Initiative 
(SVM
I) training.
 
The site principal will share a summary of our professional development progress with our parent community at various communi
ty meetings including:
