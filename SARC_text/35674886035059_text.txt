School Description  2019
-
2020
 
Jefferson El
ementary, the only school in the Jefferson School District, is located in Paicines, 
California near Pinnacles National Park.  There are no businesses or services in this small, rural and 
somewhat remote district with the nearest city, Hollister, located 35
 
miles away. The school 
consists of two buildings one of which contains a large K
-
8 classroom and office, while the second 
building, a multipurpose room, doubles as a community center after school hours. Six students in 
grades K
-
8 are currently enrolled at
 
Jefferson. Enrollment fluctuates only slightly year to year with 
many of the students starting in kindergarten and remaining through eighth grade 83% of Jefferson 
students are Hispanic and 17% are White. 33% of students are English Learners, and 17% recei
ve 
Special Education services. One full time credentialed teacher and one full time teaching assistant 
work collaboratively to provide instruction to the students. The teacher also serves as the principal 
and superintendent.
 
 
 
The Educational 
Program, 2019
-
2020
 
Though the school is small, the instructional program is rigorous, engaging, and focused on student 
growth and academic achievement. California Core State standards are taught in all subjects and a 
variety of data is utilized to set goal
s, drive instruction, gauge student progress, and measure 
program effectiveness. Assessments include formative and ongoing assessment through STAR 360, 
annual tests such as ELPAC and CAASPP, as well ongoing assessment utilized within lessons each 
day. Base
d on that data, instruction is highly differentiated for every student throughout the school 
day within small group, whole group, and one
-
on
-
one instruction from the teacher and 


Fountas and Pinnell guided reading intervention, Envision math, and Houghton Mifflin ELA. Every 
student has a new laptop and technology is integrated in teaching and learning on a daily basis. 
Finally, the students receive a broad curricular e
xperience through science and social studies 
instruction, experiments, field trips, STEAM activities, art projects, and musical performances. 
Jefferson Elementary truly provides an enriching and safe experience for all students.

About the SAR
C
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the 
Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities
 
to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional inform
ation about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The school facility is inspected on a routine and ongoing basis by the school 
staff and independent inspectors.  The teacher/principal conducts formal 
monthly inspections of the facility and grounds using a district
-
developed inspection tool; and she performs informal inspections daily .  Keenan and 
Associates formally inspect the s
chool facility and grounds annually and submit a report on findings.  Once each year, the teacher/principal inspects the 
facility using the State Facility Inspection Tool (FIT). The FIT provides a guide and criteria for evaluating the condition o
f school f
acilities resulting in ratings 



are maintained in good repair with isolated, non
-
critical deficiencies that are in the 
process of being mitigated and one major repair noted and funding approved.  Facility improvements and repairs in the last tw
o years include the 
following:  April 2017 t
he school air conditioning system was replaced; December 2017 the district replaced all inside and outside lighting with more
 
energy efficient equipment.  In 2018, removal of trees posing a potential safety risk was initiated and the initial planning/
resea
rch began for the 
replacement of the school blacktop and perimeter fencing. Funding for a new blacktop was approved in November 2019 and the wo
rk is scheduled to be 
completed before August 2020.

Jefferson district is governed by a 5
-
member school board comprised of parent and comm
unity members elected by voters.  The school board holds 
monthly meetings during which parent and community members have the opportunity to give input to school board decisions.  A c
alendar of meetings 
is sent out to parents and monthly agendas are posted 
to encourage parent/community involvement in governance issues.  The School Site Council (SSC) 
is a formal committee made up of elected parents, community and staff. The SSC meets to discuss and make recommendations to t
he board for school 
improvement and 
it plays a critical role in development of the LCAP.  By participating in annual surveys and interviews and attending School 
Site Council 
and Board meetings, parents can affect important decisions related to school improvement.
 
 
The school continues to see
k to involve the whole community. Announcements pertaining to school events and organized opportunities for 
parent/community involvement are posted outside the school, sent home to parents, and transmitted online. With the improved b
andwidth and access 
to 
technology, the school staff is implementing ways to develop ways to share more information online through Class Dojo, Google
 
Classroom, and an 
updated website is in production.   Parents continue to participate in biannual parent/teacher goal
-
setting conf
erences, and family participation events 
such as the school/community winter play, field trips, STEAM activities, Spelling Bees, the science fair, and many more.
