By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our Mission Statement:  Mark Twain staff members, students, and parents are committed to ensuring a safe and positive 
learning environment for all students.  We work collaboratively to provide students with carefully desig
ned instruction, 
interventions and challenging and engaging activities that are aligned with Common Core Standards. With the additional 
support of  technology, options for choices in learning, and a focus on learner engagement, we endeavor to empower our 
s
tudents with knowledge and enriching experiences that will contribute to our students' preparation to become college, 
career and world ready.  Indicators of the progress of students are monitored through state, district and site assessments, 
and the ELPAC.
  
Some of the assessments include district universal screening tools in language arts and mathematics, 
progress monitoring tools such as Interim Assessments Block in English language arts and mathematics , DIBELS for 
reading, Eureka Unit Assessments, Distr
ict writing assessments and state comprehensive testing on the Common Core 
Content Standards.  At the school level, teachers employ a wide variety of formative and summative assessments in both 
language arts and mathematics allowing them to adjust instruct
ion and provide intervention or advanced study.
 
 
Active involvement of our students, staff members, and Twain families are the essential keys to our successful educational 
program.  Mark Twain enjoys the benefit of many classroom, PTA and Twain Dads volunt
eers.  Parents are provided the 
opportunity to meet with site administrators during monthly Coffee with Administration meetings on the first Friday of 
every month.  We provide various forms of close communication, including our "green" paperless school web
site, weekly 
newsletters, flyers, auto
-
dialed phone messages, and marquee displays.  Our teams of teachers regularly send home 
communications and use digital messaging applications which serve to inform parents about current lessons, activities, 
and studen
ts' progress at Twain.  Please visit the RUSD website at http://twain.riversideunified.org/ for more information 
about Mark Twain Elementary School.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
o
f study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Our Parent Teacher 
Association (PTA) is involved in many activities at Twain.  PTA benefits students and staff members 
through various fund
-
raising events that support our students' field trips, instructional materials, equipment, site 
improvement and educational assemblies.
  
Our PTA is actively engaged in providing programs to promote family fun and 
involvement beyond the regular school day.  Twain Dads is a recent addition to our school community.  A group of fathers 
have come together to plan community wide school events a
nd provide support to PTA activities and events.  The Twain 
Dads organization is a subset of our PTA and hold monthly meetings.  Parents attend monthly Parent Teacher Association 
(PTA), and English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) meetings. Each year we 
provide our parents and volunteers with 
training workshops that inform our parents of state and district requirements for volunteering in public schools. 
Participants will leave this workshop with experience using our equipment and materials. By working to
gether, we believe 
that we positively build relationships which lead to increasing our students' learning. We train our volunteers to use 
effective instructional strategies with students as they volunteer in classrooms. This year, Twain parents will have t
he 
opportunity to participate in the School Smarts program. School Smarts is a seven week Parent Engagement Program 
supported by the California State PTA.  Our Parent Advisory Council is comprised of parents, teachers and classified staff.  
The Parent Advi
sory Council meets a minimum of 5 times per year to review student achievement data, the school plan, 
LCAP, school safety plan, and share in planning the next year's school plan and budget.  The support our parents provide 
students and teachers through the
ir active involvement in all of our school
-
related events and programs is priceless. The 
Mark Twain Community promotes positive interactions and responsibility in all aspects of the curriculum and in social 
interactions.  All Twain meetings are designed to
 
provide information and learning opportunities to those in attendance. 
It is no wonder that our parent involvement surpasses normal expectations of a typical elementary school. For more 
information about parent involvement and Twain's programs, please con

The School Advisory Committee or the Site Safety Committee is responsible for the development and updating of the 
school's Comprehensive Safety Plan. A Site Comprehensive Safety Plan Checklist is provided by the P
upil Services 
Department to give guidance on what should be included in the School's Safety Plan. The Safety Plan is discussed with 
staff, evaluated, amended/reviewed/updated by January 31 of each year. The school's safety committee makes monthly 
safety in
spections. A school Disaster Preparedness Plan that deals with a wide variety of emergency situations is 
incorporated into the School Safety Plan.  Earthquakes, fire, lockdown, and active shooter/intruder drills are conducted 
as required. The key elements 
of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan include an assessment of current status of school 
crime; provisions of any schoolwide dress code including the definition of "gang related apparel"; safe movement of pupils, 
parents and school employees to and from s
chool; strategies in maintaining a safe and orderly school environment; visitors 
on campus; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to 
suspensions, expulsion or mandatory expulsion and other school des
ignated serious acts which would lead to suspension 
or expulsion, notification to teachers, anti
-
bullying policy, discrimination/harassment, and school discipline rules and 
procedures pursuant to EC 35291 and EC 35291.5. The school also has an assigned Sch
ool Resource Officer (SRO).

Teachers  at Mark Twain Elementary work collaboratively in teams to support standards
-
based instructional planning and 
cycles of instructional inquiry.  In order to Increase student learning, it is essential that we evaluate, identify, analyze,
 
synthesize,
 
apply, and assess student performance in each curricular areas.  Through collaborative planning meetings and 
staff meetings, staff members work together to design high quality lessons and activities.   Aligning content standards with 
daily lessons and act
ivities is key to meeting student performance goals.  Lessons are also designed to provide for 
differentiated instruction in order to meet our students' individual needs. Technology  plays a very important role in 
student learning.  Our technology program 
motivates students to engage in learning opportunities and includes the use 
of Promethean devices, computers, and educational websites and instructional software.  Home/School technology 
connections are provided as well.  Twain's certificated and classifie
d staff members are committed to increasing their 
knowledge through professional growth opportunities sponsored by our school, RUSD Instructional Services, and other 
RUSD departments. Our  administrators, teachers and classified staff members attend profes
sional development 
workshops which serve to increase their understanding and implementation of best instructional practices.
 
During the 2017
-
2018 school year, teachers and administrators will continue focus in the area of mathematics now 
concentrating in t
he category of skills relating to concepts and procedures in mathematics.  Achievement data from the 
previous school year indicate that while growth in our overall mathematics achievement occurred, the subset of 
knowledge and skills in concepts and procedu
res is our current area of greatest need.  During this school year, we will add 
reading comprehension as an area for instructional emphasis.  Teachers and staff will receive professional development 
in each of these areas of academic achievement from distr
ict instructional support staff, through the processes of 
instructional inquiry, through district
-
provided conferences and through professional research and collaboration.  Adding 
to work begun in the 2016
-
17 school year, Mark Twain teachers and staff will
 
once again focus on student engagement as 
a school
-
wide goal.  Our sixth grade team will join our fifth grade team in full participation in Strengths Academy for 
students.  Training and follow
-
up will be provided by consultants and administration.  All te
achers will participate in 
assessment of and planning for students engagement.  Based on the success of our implementation of Positive Behavior 
and Intervention Support (PBIS) during the 2016
-
17 school year, PBIS will continue at Mark Twain for the 2017
-
18
 
school 
year.  Teachers, staff, and students will continue to receive training in the area of positive behavior.
 
During the 2018
-
19 school year, all teachers received training on Year One of the Danielson Framework for Teaching (FfT).  
This training create
s a coherent, pedagogical focus throughout the district using a common instructional framework that 
is aligned with our Guide for Instructional Direction.  It is an important investment in the professional development of the 
entire teaching faculty in RUSD
, as it will provide everyone with a common language to talk about teaching and elevate 
the instructional practice across our district.  Teachers at all grades received training in core mathematics teaching 
strategies through the Eureka math adoption.  Eac
h grade level attended training to enhance the delivery of math 
instruction in alignment with the Common Core Content Standards.  These training opportunities were provided by district 
staff development specialists who provide additional support throughout
 
the school year in the forms of coaching and 
collaborative planning.  As a staff, Twain teachers will participate in additional training focused on unpacking the Common 
Core Content Standards to enhance their standards
-
based instruction and understanding 
of the Threshold Achievement 
Level Descriptors for each grade level.  Twain staff will also begin training on the implementation of the Multi
-
Tiered 
Systems of Support to support the academic and social emotional needs of our students.  Depending on the gr
ade level, 
subject or school focus, teachers will participate in 3 

 
10 days of professional development.

During the 2019
-
2020 school year, our entire certificated and classified staff, participated in Arbinger Outward Mindset 
training.  The training was f
ocused on the strategies necessary to create a collaborative culture and outward mindset for 
Twain staff.  All teachers received training on Year Two of the Danielson Framework for Teaching. (This training creates a 
coherent, pedagogical focus throughout t
he district using a common instructional framework that is aligned with our 
revised Guide for Instructional Direction 2.0. The training supports the newly adopted Teacher Evaluation System that is 
now aligned to the Danielson Framework for Teaching.  The a
nalysis of multiple years achievement data demonstrated 
that Mark Twain English Learner students, Students with Disabilities (SWD)  and Socio
-
Economically Disadvantaged (SED) 
students are not making adequate progress in the area of English Language Arts an
d Math.  Many of our English Learners 
are also part of the SWD and SED sub
-
groups.  Therefore, we will provide training to our teachers on strategies that will 
best support the instruction for our English Learner students, the recently adopted English Lear
ner Road Map, and the 
acquisition of language. Members of the Behavior Committee will attend Level I PBIS training, with an expectation of 
implementing the program in the latter part of the 2019
-
2020 school year and beyond.  Our goal is to reduce the numbe
r 
of in school and out of school suspensions, number of office referrals and increase student engagement and school 
attendance.  Through sustained and regular leadership and grade level team meetings focusing on lesson study, teachers 
continue to adjust in
structional strategies to meet the academic needs of all students. Administrators provided support 
through planning with individual teachers and teams of teachers by using the analysis of current student data and 
classroom observations.
