School Description
 
Welcome to Upland Elementary! Our school opened in 1939, making it the oldest school in the 
Upland Unified School District. This gives it the distinction of being one of the most historic buildings 
in Upland. Upland Elementary is home to eighteen regular e
ducation classes, two Specialized 
Academic Classes, and a Literacy Lab facilitated by a credentialed Reading Specialist. We also have 
seven instructional aides who offer support in the Literacy Lab, Special Education Program and 
English Language Developmen
t and Support.  The teachers at Upland Elementary collaborate with 
our Health Tech, Psychologist and Speech Pathologist to ensure our students have their academic, 
social, emotional and physical needs met. Our enrollment of 456 students, from transitional 
kinder 
through grade 6, represents a diverse student population including more than 50% English language 
learners. We offer rigorous instruction that addresses the needs of students in meeting or 
exceeding the Common Core State Standards. All teachers inve
st time weekly in professional 
collaboration in order to analyze data and respond to the instructional needs of each student.
 
 
The staff at Upland Elementary believes that every child at our school has the potential to excel 
and accomplish great 
things. In addition to a challenging curriculum, our students have access to 
up to date technology, music, and PE. We are excited that Upland Elementary School participates 
in Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS). PBIS is a system for improv
ing student 
behavior. It is used with all students across all environments in school (classroom, lunchroom, 
restroom, playground, library, auditorium and hallways) to help create a safe and effective learning 
environment. Here at Upland Elementary, we are 
committed to teach, reinforce, and acknowledge 
appropriate student behaviors.
 
 
Upland Elementary's mission, in partnership with its children, parents, caregivers, and community 
is to provide an engaging, rigorous, academic education. All students will have
 
the ability to think 
critically, articulate thoughts  and collaborate with others. We will foster the emotional and social 
development of our children so that they demonstrate positive attributes such as self
-
control, 
tolerance, empathy, integrity, respon
sibility, and respect. Students at Upland Elementary will feel 
valued, supported and cared for as they prepare to be productive citizens in a global society.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accou
ntability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
a
nd Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reporte
d in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority:

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible st
udents 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
