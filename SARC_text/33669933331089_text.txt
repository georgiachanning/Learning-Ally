Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Three Rings Ranch Elementary was originally constructed in 2002 and is comprised of 37 classrooms, a multipurpose 
room/cafeteria, a library, a staff lounge, a computer lab, and 2 
playgrounds. Recent remodeling included upgraded 
playground equipment and upgraded fall zones. Cleaning Process: The principal works daily with the custodial staff of 1

-
time, and 1 part
-
time evening custodians to ensure that
 
the cleaning of the school is 
maintained to provide for a clean and safe school. The District's Board of Trustees has adopted cleaning standards for all 
schools in the District. A summary of these standards are available at the Educational Support Facilit
y for review. 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and work orders are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest 
pri
ority are given to emergency repairs. While reviewing this report, please note that even minor discrepancies are 
reported in the inspection process. The items noted in the table have been corrected or are in the process of remediation.
 
 
Deferred Maintenanc
e Budget:   The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which 
provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or 
replacement of existing school building com
ponents. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, 
interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades th
ree 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the mo
st significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education seq
uences or programs 
of study.
