By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card 
(SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan
 
(LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For mo
re information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP
, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
princip
al or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our vision for our students is bold and bright. La Tercera graduates will be independent and collaborative solution seekers 
who are resilient, respectful, academically successful and responsible cit
izens of the world. We are the first elementary 
STEM school in Sonoma County. As a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) focused school, we are creating the 

-

energy, engagement, perseverance and ownership of learning, our La Tercera students will prepare for the future using 
out
-
of
-
the
-
box thinking. We accomplish this mission because we have committed professionals, from teachers to ca
mpus 
aides, who are passionate about their calling. School is not just a place where we work, it is a place to change the world 
by impacting the lives of the children in our care. We provide your student a fully dedicated science lab with a certificated
 
te
acher and a true makerspace where students engineer answers to units of study using saws and  hand
-
tools under the 
capable guidance of their classroom teacher and science teacher. Other programs offered include music, PE, English 
language support, library,
 
computer software and hardware instruction, in
-
class  intervention groups and after school 
enrichment. At La Tercera we strive for educational excellence and equity for all students.
 
 
At La Tercera, we value the close bond we have with parents. We underst
and that home and school relationships are 
essential to student success. Parents supporting in the classroom, on field trips, as members parent organizations, is very 
important to us.  The community and the children know parents are active collaborators in
 
their learning, creating that 
home
-
school bond that helps La Tercera be successful.
 
 
La Tercera is a family
-
friendly school, of approximately 330 students, located in a park like setting in Petaluma. Ongoing 
school improvement is a major emphasis as we pr
epare students for life in the 21st century. Our vision for our students is 
that they will be independent and collaborative solution seekers who are resilient, respectful, flexible and academically 
successful citizens of the world. Though we value high tes
t scores, the major thrust at La Tercera is to provide students a 
well
-
rounded education. As the first STEM elementary school in Sonoma County, we offer an integrated focus in Science, 
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM.) We have a fully dedicat
ed Science Lab with a certificated science 
teacher who works collaboratively with classroom teachers to provide in
-
class, hands
-
on instruction in an authentic setting 
as well as a state of the art Makerspace. We focus on opportunities for students to take 
real life experiences and make 
connections to new information. Our teachers focus on developing lifelong learners whose sense of pride in achievement 
is intrinsically motivated by an enjoyment and appreciation of learning. We began a program called Mentor 
Me Petaluma 

connection to school and the community. We have a very active Student Council that puts on regular student led events 
throughout t
he school year. As our second
-
language population increases, we continually work on methods and strategies 
to close the achievement gap while simultaneously using our diversity as a way to strengthen the La Tercera community. 
To meet the needs of the 21st 
Century workforce, we emphasize Science, Technology,
 
Engineering, and Math (STEM) learning.
 
 
La Tercera Mission Statement: By providing quality education, La Tercera will empower individuals to become caring, 
competent, responsible citizens who value educa
tion as a lifelong process.

parents to participate in the life of our school, and the school depends on parents to 
keep many of our programs running smoothly. Parents can join our LCAP, which works with administration to help make 
financial decisions. Meetings are once a month in our
 
staff room. If you wish to join us please contact our Office Manager 
at 707

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Staff and/or parent volunteers monitor the school grounds for 20 minutes before and 
after school as well as at all recesses 
and at lunch time. Teachers regularly review the rules for safe, respectful, responsible, kind, and problem solver behavior 
in school and on the playground. Visitors must sign in at the office, where they receive a v
isitor sticker which they must 
keep visible throughout their stay. Our overall School Safety Plan and emergency drill schedule is reviewed at the 
beginning of each school year in staff meetings and with our safety committee which is a committee made up of 
school 
stakeholders. In addition, portions of the School Safety Plan are reviewed at staff meetings are (e.g., discipline, bullying,
 
dismissal procedures, emergency planning). We set aside two to four Wednesday afternoons (Staff Development/Early 
Release A
fternoons) to review specific jobs/expectations for our emergency response plan. Our PTA has helped finance 
the purchase of emergency response supplies/materials. We conduct monthly emergency drills.
 
 
As part of our safety plan, we have a school wide socio
-
emotional program known as the Toolbox program. This program 
provides students tools for conflict resolution as well as self
-
monitoring which creates a safe, peaceful school environment 
for all students TK
-
6th.  A parent night is provided in the Fall to e
ncourage the use of the tools at home. Parent newsletters 
go home and are shared on our website. Our student council highlights monthly skills through skits during assemblies and 
a weekly webcast with the principal that all students view via our website an
d in class technology.
 
 
We are working as a PBIS school and have a three year plan for full implementation.  We regularly visit school
-
wide 
expectations.  We have a school
-
wide positive reinforcement program that is used by all adults to "catch" students u
sing 
their toolbox skills as well as demonstrate school rules that result in an "eagle feather" that translates into a positive no
te 
home and an opportunity for a raffle prize.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-

In our RTI model, students  K
-
6th grade receive daily support from RTI 
assistants and classroom teachers at their academic 
level to support growth. Our model is a combination push
-
in and small group pull
-
out model with three instructional 
assistants (of which one assistant works just with our EL population), one intervention 
specialist and intervention head 
working closely together to analyze data and progress monitor on a weekly basis. With the exception of newcomers to 
our school, all English learners receive intervention support within the classroom structure and in a small
 
group setting in 
our EL classroom to provide a least restricted environment and support student engagement with access for all students 
to classroom curriculum.  We also have Schools of Hope that assist 1st graders with pointed reading intervention during
 
the school day, two days per week. Types of programs include to assist our struggling readers in the lower grades include 
Barton. Upper
-
grade students 4
-
6th work with our intervention head in small groups in a pull
-
out setting to target 
homogeneously grou
ped students using a balanced literacy approach. Programs used for our upper grade RTI include 
Daybooks for critical reading and writing (grades 3,5,6) and Treasures Triumphs for grade 4.  We are implementing Fountas 
and Pinel LLI as an intervention system
 
in Kinder through 3rd grade.  We are in the midst of developing an afterschool 
tutoring program for our students.  The Treasures Language Arts Program also includes leveled materials to support all 
learners. Students also use STAR reading and math and IXL
 
ELA and Math in the classroom on computers as well as various 
computer programs in the classroom to provide pointed support. The Accelerated Reader Program that is a district 
program provides students reading comprehension practice and skill work, at thei
r level.

Five full days per school year have been dedicated to professional development. In addition to the full staff development 
days, teachers are released from classrooms for 
several more full professional development days. After school PD sessions 
are also conducted at least once per month.  Professional development work has and continues to be focused on the 
implementation of new Math and Writing curriculum, NGSS, technology,
 
student engagement, equity, and data analysis. 
Each school site has also dedicated professional development to support each school's unique school
-
wide theme or 
charter focus. La Tercera has a Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) theme.
 
 
The d
istrict focuses on professional development using common district
-
wide assessments including:
 

 
Four benchmarks for STAR Reading and Math in grades 1st to 6th
 

 
Three  benchmarks and progress monitoring using DIBELS NEXT in grades Kindergarten to 2nd
 

 
Smarter B
alanced Assessments in ELA and Math in grades 3rd to 6th
 

 
CELDT and Pearson TELL for diagnostic data in ELA for all English Language learners; New ELPAC to be conducted 
in the Spring of 2018 and then Fall and Spring thereafter
 

 
Three district writing genres 
(Narrative, Opinion/Argument, Informational) benchmarks
 
 
Teachers are supported through a network of district level leadership positions including a Curriculum Director, and a 
District Curriculum Leadership Committee, as well as leadership teams at each si
te. Teachers meet weekly for 
collaboration and assessment of student data with their grade level peers in PLC groups. Teachers also have after
-
school 
collaboration early
-
release days at least twice a month.
 
 
Beginning teachers are supported in the North Coa
