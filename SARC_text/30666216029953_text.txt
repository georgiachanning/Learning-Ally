By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Sycamore Elementary is a Title I school located in the city of Orange, California just east of the Santa Ana River. It is one
 
of 40 schools in Orange Unified School District that serves over 29,000 students. Sycamo
re is an inclusive neighborhood 

ability. It is home to approximately 450 students in Pre
-
Kindergarten through sixth grade. Students com
e from a variety 
of ethnic backgrounds and speak many different languages. The student population is comprised of 86% Hispanic students, 
79.7% socioeconomically disadvantaged students, and 48.7% English learners. In addition, we have a variety of students 
with disabilities, including a Special Day Class where students come from both within and outside of the school boundaries 
and Inclusive Learning classrooms in grades K
-
5. At Sycamore, our diverse population is embraced, different cultural 
backgrounds are 
appreciated, and character development is encouraged.
 
 
The Sycamore staff and families are committed to creating a community of learners prepared with the skills they need to 
be successful in the 21st Century. High quality classroom instruction, students w
ho are engaged and motivated to learn, 
a warm and caring learning environment, and strong parent partnerships make Sycamore a wonderful place to learn and 
work. It is our goal that all students will leave Sycamore with the ability to communicate, collabora
te, think critically, and 
use creativity to build knowledge and innovatively apply it to improve the world in which they live. To ensure this success, 
the Sycamore community is dedicated to providing a variety of opportunities for students to learn through
 
the use of 
differentiated instruction that meets individual student learning needs. We have a modernized campus with technology 
in each classroom such as interactive SMARTBoards, large monitor displays, projectors, desktop computers and wireless 
Internet 
access. In addition, the number of iPads and Chromebooks accessible to students throughout the school is at a 
1:1 ratio, which will further enhance instruction. Teachers carefully design 21st Century standards
-
based lessons and units 
that are enhanced with
 
technology, increasing student engagement and academic achievement by connecting students 
with information and resources far beyond the limits of the classroom walls.
 
 
Sycamore Elementary is a collaborative learning community where school staff continually reflecting on instructional 
practices to improve student achievement. The following beliefs drive the actions of Sycamore staff:
 

 
We are committed to continuous improve
ment through a safe and supportive learning environment.
 

 
We promote continuous achievement for all students through collaboration focused on academic standards 
and based on assessment measures.
 

 
Students receive and use feedback to improve their learning.
 

 
All stakeholders (staff, family and community) are an integral part of the vision and mission of Sycamore 
Elementary.
 
One of the most important components of an exceptional school like Sycamore is our partnership with parents and the 
community. Sycamore ha
s a strong tradition of supportive, hard
-
working families, and we believe that parents are valuable 

funding, data and assessment so that t
hey are able to share in the leadership decisions impacting our instructional 
program. Throughout the year parents have the opportunity to develop this partnership in a wide variety of ways. Families 
can join the Parent Teacher Association (PTA), volunteer
 
in classrooms, help in the office, serve on the School Site Council 
(SSC) and English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), and celebrate community at our monthly family lunches.

In recent years, Sycamore Elementary hosted the Parent Institute for Quality E
ducation, a nine week parenting class with 
topics such as the road to university, state standards, and how to effectively partner with the school. Approximately two 
hundred parents proudly graduated from the institute at a special ceremony. Many of these p
arents are now key members 

as Strengthening Families parenting classes, nutrition classes, Family Science Night, Family Math Night, Famil
y Reading 
Night, School Safety, and English college classes for parents on our campus. For the fifth year, we will again offer the 
"Strengthening Families" program in conjunction with the Phoenix House. This program addresses communication, 
relationships, 
bonding, and connection between parents and their children. In order to keep all families apprised of school 
happenings, the principal makes weekly phone calls, which coincide with a Wednesday folder being brought home. This 
folder typically includes a mon
thly newsletter from the principal or PTA, flyers, permission slips, student work, etc. All 
written communication goes home in both English and Spanish. Additionally, the principal posts all school announcements 
on the Class Dojo app, which has over 500 Sy
camore parent users. Sycamore employs a full time Community Liaison to 
interpret at parent meetings as necessary to ensure language is not a barrier to parent involvement.

heating, LCD projectors mounted in the ceiling, Teaching Walls with storage, water fountains and sinks and the school 
purchased SMART Boards for 
each classroom.  As some of this technology is becoming outdated, the school is in process 
of replacing SMART boards and projectors with 65 inch HD monitors. Currently, 4 have been installed, with 4 more planned 
for this year. The school still houses five 
portables which are used for various purposes; such as Visual and Performing Arts 
classrooms and the After School program classrooms. There is a lunch area in the playground area covered by a shelter in 
which students eat breakfast and lunch. Sycamore Elem
entary is maintained by one full time custodian and one half
-
time 
custodian. Each quarter a site inspection report of the school grounds, including restroom facilities, is completed followed 
by work orders if needed. Inspection reports are kept on file, in
 
order to check on completion and progress of projects. 
District maintenance crews maintain the gardening of Sycamore on a weekly basis.
 
 
The campus is kept in good repair with work orders made and completed in a timely manner as concerns arise 
during 
inspections. Our most recent Facilities Inspection (FIT) report rated our campus in "Good" condition. Work orders for all 
concerns noted on the report have been submitted and/or completed.

Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Sycamore there are three major parent/community involvement groups that bring parents, staff, teachers, and 
community members together to plan and monitor school programs. The English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) is 
a representation of the staff a
nd parents of English learners at Sycamore. The work done by this committee is focused on 
monitoring and reflecting on school programs (academic, social emotional) for EL students. Through participation on this 
committee, parents are able to educate themse
lves about instruction and services offered to their English learning 
students. They provide input regarding the implementation of instructional programs. The School Site Council (SSC) brings 
together teachers, staff, parents and interested community membe
rs to advise, plan, and approve the school plan and 
budget expenditures. This council works together using various forms of data to monitor progress in meeting grade level 
outcomes and proficiency targets. The Parent Teacher Association (PTA) also plays an
 
important role in supporting the 
academic and social emotional goals of Sycamore.  They provide input regarding the school plan and help support the 
academic instructional program.
 
 
Parents, school staff, and community members are provided multiple opport
unities through these committee 
opportunities to provide feedback about our state and district priorities and how to implement them at Sycamore 
Elementary School. They are provided with an LCFF Survey and this feedback is used to evaluate the needs of our 
school. 
The School Site Council then uses this information to ensure that these priorities are included in our school plan. A school 
climate survey is also provided to parents and students. This information is used to determine ways to improve our school 
c
limate to create a learning environment that is safe and nurturing. In an effort to support parent engagement at 
Sycamore, school to home communications are in English and Spanish. A school community liaison regularly makes phone 
calls to parents and acts 
as a bridge between school and home.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 


 
32289, a Comprehensive 
Safe School Plan particular to their site. Each school site is required annually, by March 1st, to have reviewed, and if 
necessary, updat
ed their Safe School Plan. Each school forwards its Safe School Plan to the district through the office of 
Child Welfare and Attendance. The office of Child Welfare and Attendance provides plan development assistance to the 
schools and maintains a file of 
individual school plans available for inspection by the public.
 
 
Fire drills are conducted monthly, and earthquake and lock down drills are conducted quarterly. Procedures and 
expectations are discussed with the staff and student population. Each staff mem
ber is provided with information each 
year which includes information on the rainy day weather schedule, procedures for fire drills, procedure for lock downs 
and the comprehensive school safety plan. The comprehensive school safety plan includes general in
formation on 
earthquake procedures, specific responsibilities and members of each school safety team, the contents of the disaster 
preparedness backpacks, and copies of the student accountability report and injury report. School safety teams include: 
the c
ommand center, search and rescue team, site security team, first aid team, supervision and assembly team, and 
student release team. At the beginning of each school year, all staff members meet to discuss the responsibilities of the 
team.  At meetings throu
ghout the year, teams reenact the procedures in the event of a real disaster. At the beginning of 
the school year, students are trained from doing a simple duck and cover to reenacting a disaster simulation in which 
teacher teams act out their responsibili
ties while students wait for direction or release. Teachers have taken an active part 
in planning and coordinating disaster procedures. Each year, a team of volunteer teachers review the disaster plan, plan 
informational meetings, and assist all staff memb
ers with reenactments. Our most recent Safety Leadership Team meeting 
was held in October 2019.
 
 
We have implemented increased parking lot support to address the safety needs of children arriving and leaving our 
school.  The principal collaborated with sta
ff and parents to create a flow map of the parking lot procedures, which was 
sent home in the first day packet. Additionally, there is a Campus Supervisor at drop off every morning, stopping cars and 
crossing students safely onto campus from the parking lo
t. Additionally, we have parent volunteers, trained by the GRIP 
program, who act as greeters each morning, providing an extra level of safety, along with a welcoming environment. The 
principal has communicated frequently with families the importance of saf
ety in our parking lot. We also incorporated 
new boundaries and entrance procedures for our kindergarten students, which allowed for greater safety and security for 
all students.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
Through categorical funding, Sycamore has been able to add a Reading Resource Teacher. The Reading Resource Teacher 
supports students who are performing below grade level by providing an additional support time which is aligned to the 
learning level of the
 
students. The Reading Resource Teacher also organizes SBAC testing, organizes the English Language 
Proficiency for California Test, assists teachers with interpreting ELPAC data, assists teachers with organizing ELD groups, 
and assists teachers with imple
menting the ELD curriculum. The Reading Resource teacher also collects data on all ELD 
students and meets with grade level teams to analyze data for reflection on ELD strategies and student interventions.
 
 
Categorical funding also allows Sycamore Elementar
y to provide a Community Liaison for the parent community. Our 
Community Liaison provides community resources to our parent community, interprets for parent conferences, and 
actively seeks out members for the English Language Advisory Council.
 
 
Categorical
 
funding also provides funding for tutoring outside of the school day. With assessment analysis, students are 
placed in tutoring programs in order to support these students in achieving grade level standards.

Practice, which has included a focus on Math since 2017. Additionally, professional development has been focused in 
reading, specifically the
 
new reading curriculum that was adopted in 2017. Student achievement data will continue to 
drive our professional development to ensure that we are implementing instructional strategies that enhance student 
learning and increase instructional rigor and cr
itical thinking in our students. Our Instructional Specialist, Resource 
Teacher, and Instructional Leadership Team will continue to provide our staff with focused professional development. Site 
Professional Development occurs approximately once per month f
or 90 minutes, with an additional district Professional 
development session for another 90 minutes per month, approximately. Reflection, in alignment with the Collaborative 
Cycle of Effective Instruction, will be a driving principle in our school wide cult
ure of learning. Teachers will analyze data 
and set goals, develop expertise, align curriculum, design instruction, implement and reflect on lessons.
 
 
Teachers will participate in Professional Development on 19 different dates throughout the school year in
 
the form of Site 
PD, District PD, and PD follow
-
up meetings in which teachers reflect on implementation of previous PD and share ideas 
for further implementation. Additionally, teachers have been offered further professional development opportunities in 
t
he area of AVID instruction, and attendance at conferences in the areas of math, reading, and social
-
emotional health.
 
 
At Sycamore we have a full
-
time Instructional Specialist, one reading resource teacher, and an instructional leadership 
team to offer as
sistance to teachers on a daily basis. The primary responsibilities of the Instructional Specialist include: 
demonstrate effective 21st Century instructional strategies, support teachers in using data to identify small groups of 
students with common areas 
of need, identify appropriate interventions that address the specific skill needs, model 
effective interventions for teachers to use with struggling students, co
-
teach and plan 21st Century lessons that include 
strategies such as close reading, assessment 
and analysis of student performance data, provide staff development for 
teachers, provide parent workshops on elements of 21st Century curriculum, instruction, and assessment, and support 
teachers in designing 21st Century skills based lessons. The primary
 
role of the Resource Teacher is to provide student 
support and intervention in the areas of ELA and ELD. The Resource Teacher provides teachers with additional strategies 
to support struggling students through supplemental lessons, GLAD strategies, and Th
inking Maps.
