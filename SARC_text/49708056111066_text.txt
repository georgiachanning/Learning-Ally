School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School Vision and Mission
 
 
The mission of John B. Riebli School is to prepare and support students in the 21st century learning within a global 
community built on relationships, relevance and
 
rigor. Riebli offers a comprehensive elementary school program including 
rigorous academic instruction in all core subject areas. Project
-
Based learning, in which students are engaged in learning 
through integrated thematic units is a strong focus as a ch
arter elementary school. Students gain knowledge and skills by 
working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to a complex question, problem, or challenge. The core 
instructional program is supplemented with computer classes for all 3rd
-
6th graders, an Art Docent program, Garden 
program, STEM Program, a weekly fitness program, a music program, field trips, assemblies and special events. Support 
for the programs come from district funds, our resourceful Parent
-
Teacher Association, and the 
Mark West Ed Foundation. 
We offer English Language Development and academic intervention for struggling learners as a response to intervention 
(RtI). Riebli School is dedicated to the development of the whole child.
 
 
We believe that all students will succe
ed in the safe, nurturing school culture, based on strong character development 
and a positive discipline approach. Riebli has adopted the BEST (Building Effective Schools Together) framework for school
-
wide behavior expectations and positive discipline. O
ur campus is orderly and students are rewarded with "BEST" behavior 
at monthly award assemblies. We use the Second Step and "Toolbox" (social and emotional learning) programs to promote 
tolerance and empathy school
-
wide. The district supported Counseling P
rogram allows for social skills learning 
opportunities in small groups and individual sessions.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Riebli School has exceptional parent and community participation. Parent volunteers are welcomed and 
encouraged to be a part of the Riebli community. They are active in classrooms, serving on School Site Council, English 
Language Learner's Advisory Committ
ee (ELAC) and as PTA general and board members. They volunteer in the library, 
computer lab, with Student Council, for academic support, and after school sports. We highly value the time and 
commitment from parents at Riebli. On a daily basis, classes will
 
consistently have two or three parents running small 
group activities and helping our with clerical tasks. Parents make field trips possible, allowing classrooms to visit local a
nd 
Bay Area locations.
 
 
The Riebli School PTA is an active group of parents t
hat organize school events, fundraisers, and coordinate additional 
instructional programs. An example of a school event is our annual Fall Walk
-
a
-
Thon. This special community event is w 
ell attended by parents, provides a fitness
-
focused morning of walking
, while also earning funds through individual and 
business sponsorship. The funds from this event and others provide additional programs, such as weekly PE and fitness 
classes, Zumba, science in the garden, art docent, assemblies and special events. Opport
unities to be involved can be 
found at www.rieblipta.org. The Mark West Education Foundation supports Music and Arts, funding a portion of the music 
program K
-
8th, Zumba K
-
4th, and supports the Art Docent programs at each site. More information is availabl
e at 
www.mwef.org.
 
 
The business community of Larkfield regularly supports the school community through donations to fundraisers and 
special programs. Recent local scholarships have funded curriculum for our Reading Intervention library, and have 
supported
 
leadership projects of the student council. Business
-
school partnerships are vital to 21st
-
century education and 
preparing all students to find their potential for college and careers.

Riebli School has a comprehensive school safety plan that follows SIMS and NEMS guidelines. It is in line with the Mark 
West District Safety Plan. The plan is reviewed at the beginning of each school year with the entire staff. Safety inspection
s 
are done 
routinely by the maintenance department, especially prior to school opening.

The staff roles in case of an emergency are outlined in the comprehensive plan. A "flip
-
book" of emergency responses for 
various situations and drill procedures are kept in an ob
vious location in each classroom. Classrooms and all common 
areas (library, computer lab, and MPR, for example) are equipped with a red emergency bag containing first aid supplies.
 
 
Fire, earthquake and shelter

in

place drills are practiced routinely.
 
 
In 
the fall the Riebli School Site Council reviews the District Safety and Wellness plans and policy at the same time they 
review the Riebli School BEST Plan. The Riebli School BEST Plan is the behavior expectation and discipline plan for Riebli 
Elementary sc
hool. BEST is an acronym for Building Effective Schools Together. It is a system, which gives staff, students, 
and community a structure to support strong character development, expected behaviors, and have fair discipline 
consequences. We look at discipli
ne data, target areas for student training, and celebrate student successes. BEST is 
research
-

 
 
School personnel will support appropriate student behavior to nurture a safe, caring, compassionate, and collaborative 
learning environment. Student choices and consequences for not following school behavior expectations will follow school 
and district pol
icy.
 
 
Positive Discipline is based on the following principles: mutual respect (I respect myself and I respect you), all people str
ive 
for belonging and significance, mistakes are opportunities to learn, logical and natural consequences that are reasonable
, 
related, and respectful help people ow  and grow from mistakes, and children will develop competencies when we provide 
them with responsibilities and support. Violations of expectations will be addressed in a positive, respectful, reasonable 
and related 
manner. Keeping in mind that mistakes are opportunities to learn and grow, consequences will be issued on 
a severity continuum and can include a conference with the teacher, phone call to the parent, written reflection or 
apology, conflict mediation, behav
ior plan, loss of privileges, suspension, or expulsion.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
Supplemental services are provided for students who need extra support to access the core curriculum or are functioning 
above the range of the class. These services are provided during the school day. Students may be regrouped for additional 
support with r
eading, language arts skills or English Language Development. Students may also be regrouped to extend 
the curriculum. Students with the most severe learning needs are provided with special education services.
 
 
Riebli School utilizes a Response to Interven
tion approach in providing services to support student learning that we call 
"Blended Services". Four days a week, students at each grade level are grouped by their student need for 30 minutes of 
language arts. Services are provided through the support of 
a part
-
time Reading Specialist, Resource Specialist teacher, 
Resource paraprofessional, and EL paraprofessional support. A Gifted and Talented Education, or GATE teacher, provides 
a weekly 90
-
minute block of time for students in grades 4
-
6, to explore exte
nded learning and participate in the county 
student programs.
 
 
The district partners with Extended Child Care Coalition of Sonoma County (ECC) and Boys & Girls Club of America, to 
provide after
-
school child care, which also supports students academically i
n homework support and social development.

The district continues to provide counseling services for students who are having school adjustment difficulties or to 
provide support in time of family crisis. The district counselor provides direct services at 
each site, and supervises interns. 
As a result, Riebli School has an on
-
site school counselor minimally four of five days. The district provides a part
-
time 
school nurse to primarily conduct all state and federal screening, and provide consulting service.
