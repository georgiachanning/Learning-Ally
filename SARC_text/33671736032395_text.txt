About the SARC
 
By Febru
ary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fundi
ng Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state a
nd local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the 
school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
At Cahuilla Elementary, we provide accessibility and opportunities for parents with limited English proficiency, parents with
 
disabilities, and parents of 
migratory students to participate in our school and the develo
pment of Cahuilla's parent involvement policy by: providing translation for parents at all 
parent meetings and for all written correspondence. Cahuilla also meets the federal and state requirements for access for per
sons with disabilities. In 
addition all 
parents are invited to become members of the Parent Teacher Organization which provides opportunities for them to support our
 
students 
through: volunteering in the classrooms, library, picture day, student store, book fairs, field trips, annual carnival, a
nd fundraisers. The PTO also hosts a 
parents and pastries annual event to encourage parents to get involved with the PTO as well as enjoy breakfast with their chi
ld at school. A copy of the 
Parent Involvement policy distributed on a yearly basis, is on fil
e in the office, and copies can be provided, free of charge, to all parents upon request.
 
 
Annually, Palm Springs Unified School District and Cahuilla host a Back to School Night in the fall to visit classrooms and l
earn about grade level standards 
as well
 
as celebrate the work that students have produced. Throughout the year Cahuilla teachers organize family nights including Fam
ily Reading Night 
and Science Night. In addition, we we are very proud of our arts program, with two productions throughout the ye
ar, our Talent Show and Winter Musical 
are always favorites with the students and parents.
 
 
At Cahuilla Elementary, parents have the opportunity to participate in traditional parent teacher conferences during the desi
gnated times of the school 
year. In add
ition, SSC meets on a regular basis to support families and students. Parents and/or teachers are able to call conferences at
 
any time either 
party feel necessary.
 
 
Parents are encouraged to be a part of the following committees: School Site Council and En
glish Language Advisory Council. The parents on these 
committees play a pivotal role in assisting the school in the development of the school plan, allocation of resources, its im
plementation, and the annual 
review of the school plan. The parents on the sc
hool site council also help the staff to develop the school's parent engagement policy which is distributed 
to all parents at the beginning of each school year. In addition, they help identify staff education needs around valuing and
 
supporting parent educ
ation. 
In addition, Cahuilla hosts 7 Habits of Highly Effective Famlies training during the year, as well as "make and take" events 
sponsored by teachers in 
content areas.

ears safety vests during recess, lunch, and after school duty, which make them highly visible while supervising students. 
Additional drills are conducted when recent events warrant an emphasis of a particular aspect of school safety.
 
 
The school wide 
discipline plan will reflect the expectation that all students adhere to the Self
-
Manager expectations, and is aligned to the Pillars of 
Character. The school community will be treated with fairness and respect. Students will be given Caught Being Good Tic
kets for treating others 
respectfully and fairly. Students who earn Self
-
Manager status earn additional recess time as a reward for making good choices. Cahuilla has implemented 
a Social
-
Emotional Learning Curriculum called Second Steps, in order to ensure
 
students are being taught these essential skills.
 
 
The staff at Cahuilla makes every effort to keep students safe on school grounds before, during, and after the school day. Th
e school day begins at 8:40 
a.m. and dismisses at 3:30 p.m. Students are allowe
d on campus beginning at 8:15 a.m. for breakfast and the playground opens at 8:20 at which time 
supervision is provided. All staff members supervise all students at the bus loading zone and the student pick up zone at the
 
end of the school day. All 
gates t
o the school are locked during the school day. Any volunteer must first sign a volunteer form, are screened through the Megan
's Law web site, 
meet with the principal, and are fingerprinted if volunteering more than 4 hours. Visitors are required to report 
to the office to sign in via Raptor before 
being allowed on campus. All visitors must wear a visitor badge when visiting the school campus. In addition, Cahuilla added 
the Raptor Visitor 
Management system that scans the ID's of all visitors to a registry o
f sex offenders.  Volunteers who wish to contribute services in an on
-
going manner, 
must have a face
-
to
-
face meeting with the principal before beginning their service. Finally, Cahuilla Elementary is a closed campus, which means 
only 
visitors with appointm
ents are allowed to sign
-
in via Raptor and enter campus. All volunteers, supervisory or non
-
supervisory, must register as a volunteer 
using the PSUSD Policy.
 
 
Internal emergency procedures are in place and will be adhered to in the event of a catastrophic 
disaster. Monthly fire and disaster drills take place to 
ensure all students and staff is prepared for a safe evacuation in the event of an emergency. Finally, a multi
-
tiered Crisis Response plan is in place as well. 
We fully comply with a variety of emerg
ency preparedness drills including: Active Shooter/Lock
-
Down/Shelter In Place, Fire Drills, & Earthquake Drills. 
We utilize the H.E.R.O. Curriculum to prepare students as well. The School Safety Plan was reviewed with the entire staff on 
August 7, 2019 at 
our annual 
back
-
to
-
school meeting. The plan was reviewed again by the Safety Committee on November 19, 2019.

Each year we have designed professional learning based on student achievement data, research of best practices and discussion
s with teachers and 
principals. The specific approaches vary by content area. For ELA, in 2017
-
18, the focus was on aligning instru
ction to Smarter Balanced Assessments, 
depth of knowledge, and deeper understanding of the Reading Targets in Claim 1. In 2018
-
19 the focus was on the gradual release model, and 2019
-
20 
was an extension of the previous two years, as well as an addition of 
training around Claim 2 (Writing). The professional development in these areas was 
provided by the Schoolhouse Project. In 2018
-
19 the teachers began working with High Impact Math consultants. This professional development centers 

 
conceptual understanding. The training will take place over the course of three years.  During Year 1 (2018
-
19) the focus was 
on developing strategies to support number sense by implementing mental math routines and highlight the landscape of learning
 
in 
mathematics. During 
Year 2 (2019
-
20) the focus is on strengthening mental math routines, identifying the math goal of a lesson, and planning for and implement
ing a three
-
part lesson (Launch, Explore, Summarize). This professional development also supports 
teachers with the implementation of the district
-
adopted math 
program (Bridges in Mathematics and Number Corner).
 
The numbers in the chart above represent 12 days of ELA training in 2017
-
18 and for the 2018
-
19 and 2019
-
20 years there are 6 full days for EL
A and the 
remaining days are full days of professional learning for math.

escalation, supervision and communication materials, substitute costs associated with Student Success Team meetings, as well 
as
 
curricular 
planning. This year, we added a Teacher On Special Assignment to support PLC/Data Analysis teams. Data analysis team meetings
 
focus on creating action 
plans to support underachieving students in mastering standards while using technology. Also,
 
funds are used to ensure Cahuilla students have access 
to technology as a daily part of their learning environment. In addition, underachieving students are supported through categ
orical funds by purchasing 
supplemental standards
-
based instructional mater
ials for intervention classes within the school day and providing after school intervention classes. An 
increased focus on Social
-
Emotional Learning is also evident in the SPSA.
 
 
All students receive a Tier I approach to learning using Best First Instructi
on including access to recent adopted curriculum, teacher designed and targeted 
instruction, guided reading, small group instruction/intervention, and tutoring. Students demonstrating a need for additional
 
support receive it in a Tier 
II programs that incl
ude teacher tutoring and SES tutoring. The SST process is used to meet the needs of students who are demonstrating struggles 
in 
learning. PLC's are utilized as a part of the Pre
-
SST process to ensure a tiered support system for students is in place to prom
ote early detection and 
prevention.
 
 
Cahuilla also provides categorical funds to support enrichment for Gifted and Talented Education students through purchasing 
supplemental instructional 
materials as well as providing enrichment classes after school. Spe
cials Education students are supported through categorical funding by providing 
teacher training, instructional materials, and intervention classes after school.
