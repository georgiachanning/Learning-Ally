Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

-

th only 200 students 
in grades Pre School
-
5 and 10 highly qualified teachers (including a Resource Teacher, a Reading Intervention Teacher and 
a Music Teacher), we are able to offer each individual student our attention and support. Our programs reflect th
e 
diversity of our student population and the beauty and wonder of the Anza Borrego Desert that surrounds us. We strive 
to meet the individual needs of our students through the use of ongoing assessments and small group instruction with 
appropriate interve
ntions. We monitor our students' academic growth through the administration of MAP assessments 
(Measures of Academic Progress) and other local assessments 3 times a year. These results are used for planning for 
student needs within our MTSS framework (Mult
i Tiered Systems of Support). 
 
 
Our goal is that every child will be prepared and motivated to pursue a post
-
high school education. Staff shares a relentless 
focus on student achievement with no excuses on the part of teachers, students or parents. Our tea
chers participate in 
weekly collaboration and goal setting to modify instruction based on the results of assessments. Our character education 
program involves teaching 5 Elements of Borrego PRIDE: Perseverance, Respect, Integrity, Discipline, and Empathy. 
We 
also implement PBIS (Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports) school
-
wide to assist our students in learning about 
and managing their emotions and behavior.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan provides students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning 
environment. Our plan includes the following requirements of SB 187: current status of school crime; child abuse reporting 
procedures,
 
disaster procedures, routine and emergency procedures, policies related to suspension and expulsion; 
notification to teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, 
parents, and school employee
s; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures. Students and staff 
have rehearsed routines for the possibility of earthquakes or fire, and we also prepare for a possible "shooter on campus" 
or as we call it, "bees on campus".  In s
uch cases, staff and students know how to immediately return to the nearest 
building for shelter.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and updates the plan as needed. The plan was updated and reviewed with school 
staff in September of 2017. A copy of th
e plan is available for public review at the school office.

The dual foci for Professional Learning at Borrego Springs Elementary are Student Talk & Formative Assessment.  
Professional learning opportunities are offered in two main pedagogical areas:  providing frequent opportunities 
for 
student discourse (student talk) for teachers to collect evidence of student understanding, and then giving effective 
feedback to students so they can take ownership of their learning and increase their understanding.  Teachers and staff 
also attend pr
ofessional development in content areas, as needed. We selected Student Talk & Formative Assessment as 
our primary instructional emphases because we aim to offer more than a year's growth for each year a student attends 
class here, and the use of Formative
 
Assessment strategies is cited by John Hattie as having a much larger than average 
effect size.
 
 
Professional learning takes place every week during our Early Release time (students are dismissed 75 min early each 
Monday), our twice yearly non
-
student PD 
work days, and our monthly District
-
wide Minimum Days.  We also offer release 
time for teachers to observe their peers, attend professional learning opportunities off
-
site, and to consult with coaches 
from the County Office of Education who work with us to
 
improve our instructional program.  Our most recent Book Study 
focused on the four components of Reading:  Read
-
Aloud, Shared Reading, Guided Reading & Independent Reading.  Our 
book was "Who's Doing the Work 
-
 
How Teachers Can Say Less so Students Can Do
 
More".  This year we're focusing on 
PBIS strategies (Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports) and we're also learning a lot about how to help students 
with Dyslexia or other reading difficulties.
