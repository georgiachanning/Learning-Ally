Reported Using Data from the 2018
-

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Bishop Elementary School is located in Sunnyvale, California in the hea
rt of Silicon Valley. Our 450 students in transitional 
kindergarten through fifth grade represent several ethnic backgrounds including Hispanic, Caucasian, Filipino, and Asian. 
Our families come from a variety of occupations, educational levels, and socioe
conomic backgrounds, making Bishop a 
diverse community.
 
 
Our instructional program provides students with in
-
depth knowledge in the core subject areas. Teachers use the Common 
Core Standards and state adopted curriculum to offer students engaging and meani
ngful learning opportunities. Teachers 
collaborate weekly to look at student progress and then design and adjust instruction to meet the needs of all students. 
Other programs include iReady Math, Contexts for Learning, Headsprout, Raz
-
Kids, Reading Partner
s, Kids Learning After 
School (KLAS), GirlStart, Physical Education, as well as arts instruction in music, theater, visual arts, and dance.
 
 
Our Positive Behavioral Intervention Support (PBIS) Program strengthens our safe, respectful and responsible learni
ng 
environment for all of our students. Our partnership with PlayWorks provides students with structured play through 
classroom lessons and organized games on the playground.
 
 
Finally, as a Leader in Me school, students, parents, teachers, and staff learn 
how to be responsible, show initiative, be 
creative, set goals and meet them, get along with people of various backgrounds and cultures, and resolve conflicts and 
solve problems.  Everyone learns how to apply the 7 Habits to their work and personal lives. 
 
Through ongoing professional 
development and coaching, we have deeply learned the 7 Habits to enhance the safe, respectful and responsible Bishop 
school culture.  Leadership roles and events take place throughout the school year for our entire community. 
 
We apply 
what we learn more deeply to academics through goal setting, data tracking, and student
-
led conferences.  Together, we 
recognize and celebrate the greatness of each child and provide students with multiple opportunities to develop their full 
pote
ntial.
 
 
School Mission Statement
 
We empower everyone to have a voice and the confidence to persevere as learners and leaders who will inspire change 
in themselves and in the world.
 
 
School Motto
 
Lead Together and Inspire Change

vement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for 
entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

Professional development for the Bishop staff occurs through many opportunities. At Bishop, we value collaboration and 
incorporate it into all that we do. Continuous progress 
monitoring using common assessments provides our staff with data 
that is analyzed through Professional Learning Communities.  The principal, assistant principal and instructional coaches 
attend grade level meetings to offer input and guidance around data a
nalysis and instructional best practices.
 
 
Our state and local school data are used to determine growth areas and site professional development is planned 
accordingly. Teachers participate in three full days of professional development during the school ye
ar. In addition, 
monthly teacher learning days, when students are released early, provide additional time for focused professional 
development. All teachers participate in district
-
wide professional development three times a year and ongoing coaching 
at th
e site level.
 
 
Recent professional development topics include:
 

 
Leader in Me
 

 
Common Core Standards in all Academic Areas
 

 
Next Generation Science Standards
 

 
English Language Development
