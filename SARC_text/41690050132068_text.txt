School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The S
ARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for 
Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At KIPP, constant communication between the school and home are encouraged and facilitated. Parents are involved in 
planned parent nights as well as parent/teacher conferences where they will learn about their c

strategies to support their child at home. By staying committed to open communication with the parents, it helps provide 
the proper support that KIPP students need in order for them to be successful.
 
 
In an effort to develop the best 
possible relationships with the community that we serve, we supply all of our teachers 
with cellular phones in order to maintain open communication with families. On the first day of school, parents will be 
given the cellular phone number of all staff memb
ers and will be encouraged to use it whenever they need clarification 

 
 
Parents participate in family meetings to receive training on how to support the development of
 

writing and mathematical skills at home, as well as financial planning sessions. Parents are engaged annually regarding 

lity Plan. 
Other opportunities for parent involvement include newsletters, local field trips and end of year trips, and fun events such 
as picnics and dances.

At KIPP, the School Leader sets the tone and develop the conditions under which staff members become the keepers of 

a positive campu
s culture, sharing the best instructional practices, and encouraging individual teacher growth.
 
 
Beginning in staff orientation before school begins, the School Leader ensures that teachers fully understand and support 

c values, emphasizing a rigorous, standards
-
based college preparatory program. This 
orientation involves specific activities designed to align the staff and foster teamwork and constant learning while allowing
 
staff to understand the detailed intricacies o
f the school culture. As part of the learning and team
-
building process, staff 

 
includes workshops around data
-
driven instruction, 
backwards planning model, and building positive relationships with 
students. In addition, staff is trained in various teaching strategies to ensure that all students are provided with multiple
 
avenues to access the curriculum.
 
 
During the school year, staf
f development continues through 5 professional development days, weekly staff meetings, 
and department and grade
-
level team meetings. KIPP teachers participate in two weeks of inservice during which they are 
trained to function effectively within the param
eters of the school and to meet the goals outlined in the accountability 
agreement. Teachers observe each other and other excellent teachers in the community, and receive regular feedback on 
their performance, goals, and growth from the School Leader. Teac
hers consistently exchange best practices with each 
other and teachers at similar schools. Teachers also have the opportunity to attend subject
-
matter conferences with other 
KIPP teachers around the country as well as an annual gathering of over 2,000 KIPP
 
teachers for a week
-
long conference 
of learning best practices.
