By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Barbara Benson Elementary is an outstanding California Gold Ribbon and Title I Academic Achievement school that focuses 
on the educational achievement of all students th
rough rigorous standards and engaging instructional strategies. As a Title 
I School with 49% socio economically disadvantaged students (SED) and 21% English Language Learners (ELL), many

initiative provides students opportunities to use technology to enhance their learning opportunities and prepare our 
students with 21st century learning skills. Additionally, the 1:1 technology learning 
environment increases student 
engagement and minimizes negative behaviors for all students including the unique population of Special Education 
students.
 
 
Benson Elementary seeks to increase the overall reading achievement of all students through balanced 
literacy instruction 
with an emphasis on conferring during ELA and Math instructional blocks. Teachers are supported with Connect Coaches 
(Teacher On Special Assignment) who directly support teachers through coaching and modeling of best teaching practices
. 
These intensive, grade level specific, lab

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Tustin Unified School District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist 
in 
this effort, the District uses a facility survey instru
ment developed by the State of California Office of Public School 
Construction (OPSC). The results of this survey are available at the school office, the District office, or on the Internet a
t 
https://tinyurl.com/TUSD

Facility
-
Inspection
-
Tool. The District
 
maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to 
keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to 
ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Barbara Benson Elementary School is a beautifully maintained school built in 1960. It closed for a period of time, and re
-
opened in 1991. The school was refurbished in 2006 with Measure G monies. Recently, an extended parking lot was added 
to the school. 
 
This allowed for more staff to park on site improving traffic flow.  Landscape was updated to enhance curb 
appeal.  Benson also received three portables which were painted and created a beautiful new look for the school campus. 
Carpet was replaced in all 
classrooms and school buildings during the summer of 2019. Hand painted murals surround the 
campus. Our grounds are maintained by District staff.  Visitors who walk on campus are welcomed by pleasant staff 
members and safe, happy students, who are surround
ed by beautiful flowers and a clean campus.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

to attend parent education opportunities that are offered to educate parents on topics such as homework, responsibility, 
and positive discipline.  Events and
 
workshops that the principal and community liaison prepare include, but are not 
limited to, "Supporting Your At
-
Risk Reader" presented by our intervention teacher, "Academic Parent Teacher Team" 
meetings presented by teachers, and Parents in Action active
 
lunch time organized game play with supplemental evening 
activities to engage the whole family.  In addition, Benson's Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) works hard to raise funds 
to pay for enrichment programs that support the curriculum.  For more inform

Tustin Unified School District provides dedicated time for professional development for all staff.  Schools often provide 
additional professional development time based on specific school
-
site scheduling and budgetary decisions.  The District 
provides inte

and enhanced skills for the upcoming year.  Staff development opportunities are also offered after school and by release 
time throughout the school year. 
 
Additionally, professional development is provided one non

one afternoon per month after school.  New teachers are provided an extensive new teacher training program throughout 
the year to support their implementation of effect
ive instruction.In regards to our educational programs and instruction, 
our dedicated teachers engage in collaborative planning two Wednesdays each month. The principal provides staff 
professional development meetings that focus on the processes of Balance
d Literacy, English Language Development, 
Cognitively Guided Instruction in Math (CGI), differentiating instruction, data interpretation and analysis and best first 
instruction.  For the 2017
-
18 and 2018
-
19 school years, we contracted with Momentum consult
ants to provide 
professional development in the area of Reading and Writing Workshop.  For the 2019
-
20 school year, professional 
development is offered in the area of mathematical mindsets through Stanford's online YouCubed program.

practices. The school Leadership Team meets monthly to discuss school
-
wide timelines, data, and systems to support 
student learning.  Teachers are also supported 
by instructional coaches.  The coaches plan and work with teachers to 
improve instruction in English Language Arts, Math, and Social Emotional Learning curriculum to ensure success for all 
students. All new teachers participate in the district's induction 
program.  Non
