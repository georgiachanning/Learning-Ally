About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by 
state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are re
quired to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is
 
to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For mo
re information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact th
e school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, A
vailability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Arvin Union School District held a Public Hearing on September 10, 2019 and determined that each school within the district h
ad sufficient and good 
quality textbooks, instructional 
materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, 
including English Language Learners (ELL), are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks to instructional materials, or both,
 
in core subjects 
for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed b
y the California 
Department of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available.
 
 
Ar
vin Union School District staff members are actively involved in the selection process of materials and textbooks. The select
ion process involves 
teachers, administrators, district support personnel, and parents. The district follows the State of Californi
a's Textbook Adoption Cycle.  100% of students 
had required textbooks as evidenced during the most recent August 2019 Williams review.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
El Camino Real Elementary School is comprised of 38 classrooms, 2 computer labs, a multipurpose room/cafeteria, library, 
staff lounge, two playgrounds 
and an administrative office. The facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample classroom and playground
 
space, and a staff resource

The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for a
ll schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available upon request from 
the district MOT office. The principal works closely with the Lead Maintenance person and custodians assigned to the site to 
develop cleaning schedules 
to ensure a clea
n and safe school. El Camino Real has one daytime custodian and one grounds person. In addition, there are two night custodia
ns assigned 
to the site.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and worki
ng order are completed in a timely manner. An 
online work order process is used to ensure efficient service and the emergency repairs are given the highest priority. A Sol
ar Panel Project was completed 
in 2017 and is fully operational, Also, the elementary
 
playground received the following updating: artificial turf was installed and an addition to the 
permanent playground structure was added in the fall of 2018. Two shade structures were added in 2019.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of 
study

oving instructional 
programs to support academic achievement, improving student attendance, training staff to support in building r
espectful and positive relationships,

the school site included action steps for extended learning sessions
, library books, intervention staff  and intervention computer programs, nurses,
