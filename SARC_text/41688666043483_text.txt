School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Age of Buildings:
 
 

and administrative offices. The main buildings were constructed in 1954 and modernized in 2003. Prior to the opening of 
the 2013
-
2014 
school year, Ralston completed a two
-
phase modernization program. During the first phase that took place 
over the 2012 summer, 4 brand new science classrooms and 4 classrooms devoted to the elective program were added. 
 
 
During the 2012
-
2013 school year, t
he construction of the library and the new administrative offices were completed. 
Over the summer of 2013, the main building was renovated with many new upgrades. Four additional classrooms were 
added to the main building as well as an additional computer 
lab. The building was renovated with new flooring, lighting, 
and storage, which gives the building a much
-
needed update. The lockers were removed from the main hallway, which 
also provided students with a much easier passing period between classes. 
 
 
Durin
g the 2014
-
2015 school year, an additional classroom structure was planned and constructed. This two
-
story building 
opened prior to the start of the 2015
-
2016 school year. 
 
 
Cleaning Standards: The District has adopted cleaning standards for each school, a
nd a copy of these is available in the 
administrative offices. The Ralston Administration works daily with the custodial staff to develop and implement cleaning 
practices that ensure a clean and safe school campus.

Maintenance and Repair: 
 
 
District main
tenance staff, assisted as necessary by outside contractors, keeps the school in good repair. Work orders are 
completed in a timely manner and tracked on a computerized system of record
-
keeping, which also allows priority to be 
assigned to emergency repair
s. 
 
 
Complaints and Reports of Conditions Requiring Remedy: 
 
 
Each classroom contains a notice regarding the availability of complaints or reports of unsafe condition forms, which can 

int Process (per Board Policy) in responding to all 
filed complaints. 
 
 
Specialized classrooms are available for science, computer labs, animation, culinary arts, and music. In addition, there are 
two science buildings that house labs for 6th, 7th and 8th 
grades, and a large school gymnasium. Every classroom has at 
least one computer connected to the Internet. Three classrooms are equipped as multimedia classrooms. The PTA and 
district have purchased interactive SMARTBoards, LCD projectors, Large Monitors, 
document cameras, and teacher 
laptops for all the classrooms. Both PTA and School Force have enabled Ralston to purchase technology for the classrooms 
such as 32 iMac computers for our lab, 43 chrome book carts, and three iPad carts. 
 
 
As of December, 2019
, the following have been done to address the "fair" and "poor" ratings on the FIT:
 

 
The school's fire alarm system has been repaired and tested.
 

 
All safety
-
related issues have been repaired.
 

 
District has increased the frequency of pest inspections for rodents.
 

 
Gymnasium HVAC and roof have been repaired and appear functional.
 

 
General restroom repairs and aesthetic issues are being addressed on an ongoing basis.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupi
l Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Californi
a Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate ac
hievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entra
nce to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
In order to provide students with a safe school that maintains a positive climate for learning, Ralston Middle School staff 
has a multifaceted approach to safety. The Board of Trustees Board Policy requires the school to maintain an updated 
Emergency Prepa
redness plan, which covers emergencies such as earthquakes, fire, bomb threats, or other disturbances. 
The plan includes emergency phone numbers, roles for staff members, and procedures to ensure student safety. Ralston 
staff members participate in the Bel
mont Safe Schools program and our School Safety Committee, attend meetings and 
take part in simulations to develop and to keep our safety plans current. A School Resource Officer from the Belmont 
Police Department works with the school's administration to 
maintain a safe and secure campus. Emergency Response 
lists and Emergency phone trees are updated yearly. The school holds emergency drills monthly to prepare students and 
staff for a range of situations. At staff meetings following the drills, administrat
ion and staff debrief on improving the 
safety on campus for students and staff.
 
 
Students are advised of the policies regarding Sexual Harassment, bullying and cyberbullying. Staff members regularly 
address issues of concern about school safety and are pro
active in addressing all types of bullying. Staff was given the 
school's safety plan on August 29, 2019. Updates were initially made in early August and are ongoing as needed. Every 
year the PTA supports programs to support positive school climate and safe
ty.
 
 
School safety also encompasses the health and well
-
being of students on campus and addresses school climate issues such 
as anti
-
bullying programs, supporting positive behavior and encouraging healthy habits. Other school safety
-
related 
programs includ
e the Positive Behavior Support Program which instructs students on positive and appropriate behaviors 
and actions. Ralston continues to develop data gathering systems so that we can react in a timely way to school
-
wide 
safety concerns.
