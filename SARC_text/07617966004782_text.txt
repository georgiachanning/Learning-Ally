By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or
 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
pr
incipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school us
es 
the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessa
ry to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The school personnel also works 
daily with the cust
odial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment 
of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mat
hematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCS
S] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or car
eer technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of the School Site Safety Plan is to provide a unified template for school sites to respond and recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the disruption of normal school operations.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan guides a coordin
ated school staff response to an emergency, disaster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over time
 
and those that may occur without warning.
 
 
The objectives of the School Site Safety Plan are as follows:
 
1.
 
Protect the safety and welfare of students, school staff, and visitors.
 
2.
 
Provide for a safe and coordinated response to emergencies.
 
3.
 

 
4.
 
Enable the District to restore normal conditions with minimal confusion in the shortest time possible.
 
5.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between sites and the District Emergency Operations Center 
(DEOC).
 
6.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between the District EOC and the Cities of Richmond, El Cerrito, San 
Pablo, Pinole, Hercules, and Contra Costa County Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
 
7.
 
Provide for the orderly conversion of pre
-
designated
 
District sites to mass care sites, when necessary.

Quality instruction and instructional leadership are at the heart of our efforts. To ensure this, teachers, administrators, 
and other personnel engage in ongoing professional development focused on improving teaching and learning. Training 
includes data us
e and sharing, which guides teaching, learning, and goal setting. The principal and trained teacher leads, 
in turn, provide support to teachers through a variety of professional learning communities, opportunities for collaborative 
study and planning, and 
individual coaching based on ongoing classroom observations. Teachers and other staff are 
provided with both on and off
-
site professional development in common core state standards. State and District 
assessment data drives the current professional develop
ment focus on writing using Columbia University's Teachers 
College Units of Study for Writing and Reading, math writing and multiple methods for concept mastery, differentiated 
instruction, and educational technology. A primary goal of the professional dev
elopment program is ensuring that all 
students are served by skilled, highly qualified teachers and that teachers are supported by strong, knowledgeable 
instructional leaders.
