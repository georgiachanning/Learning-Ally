By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School Vision:
 
Carl Hankey K
-
8  strives to develop inquirin
g, knowledgeable and caring young people.   We will be a connected 
community, from the school to the local city, and beyond to world
-
wide partnerships. Our students will thrive from 
exposure to global issues and real life challenges.  Academic success will
 
be fostered through our rigorous IB programmes 
aligned to the Common Core Standards, enabling our students to become critical
-
thinking adults who will participate with 
confidence in an ever
-
evolving world.
 
 
 
School Mission:
 
Carl Hankey K
-
8 International B
accalaureate School develops active, compassionate, internationally
-
minded, life
-
long 
learners.
 
 
 
Our Mission Is Learning
 
There are many things that make Carl Hankey K
-
8 school so special. Hankey is known for its warm, neighborhood 
atmosphere, its deeply r
ooted sense of community and its configuration as a K
-
8 school, which provides parents with an 
alternative to the traditional elementary K
-
5 to middle school 6
-
8 matriculation pathway. There is another thing, however, 
which sets our school apart, distingui
shing it as a unique educational setting.  We are proud to be the ONLY public 
International Baccalaureate (IB) World School in Orange County offering both the Primary and Middle Year IB programs, 


mandates, woven into a rich instructional tapestry.
 
 
What is different about an IB school?  At Hankey we strive to develop inquiring, knowledgeable and caring youth who help 
create a better and more pea
ceful world through intercultural understanding and respect. Our curriculum embraces an 
inquiry
-
based instructional program promoting critical thinking and problem solving. Traditional subjects such as math, 
science, history, languages, literature, and the
 
arts are integrated and intertwined, rather than compartmentalized neatly 
into prescribed time slots. For example, rather than learning about math, then closing the text book and completing an 
art project, IB students learn mathematic principles through c
reative art assignments. Or, they might solve a social 


 
 
Students in our The 
Primary Year Program (PYP
-
 
K
-
5th grade) embark on a yearlong academic journey framed by six 
transdisciplinary themes: Who we Are, Where we Are in Place and Time, How we Express Ourselves, How the World 
Works, How we Organize Ourselves, and Sharing the Plan
et. Each theme takes 5
-
6 weeks to cover and concludes with a 
performance
-
based assessment project that allows students to demonstrate what they have learned about their world 
through that particular theme.
 
 
Additional enrichment activities integrated into 
the PYP curriculum including weekly Language B (Spanish) instruction; 
additional P.E.; an intensive Art Masters program tied to the transdisciplinary themes,  a semester of Primary Music for 
grades K
-
3; and 80 minutes per week of instrumental and choral mu
sic for grades 4
-
5.

Standards to excel. We use a variety of instructional strategies to intertwine the CCSS in ELA and math, with hig
her
-
level 
thinking and problem
-
solving skills to ensure that all learners can attain the rigorous thinking demanded by our 
interdisciplinary IB curriculum.  Students who struggle are supported with intervention, while students who are ready to 
accelerate a
nd move beyond are provided with opportunities to extend their thinking.
 
 
Carl Hankey provides a disciplined, safe and nurturing student environment through its positive behavior system featuring 
the IB Learner Profiles, which celebrate the attributes of a
 
successful scholar and form the foundation of our Essential 
Agreements, agreed upon norms for student behavior. Each month teachers in all grades select one student from their 
class who has demonstrated exemplary application of one of these attributes, an
d these students are honored at the 
Student of the Month celebration. Students who observe our Essential Agreements earn Hawk Pride tickets which can be 
redeemed during the biweekly Treasure Chest lunches.. ASB, Water Bottle Wednesday, our school recycling
 
program, 
Afterschool Drama Hawks, assemblies and field trips are other programs that further support the development of the 
whole child and offer an impressively extensive educational program.
 
 
 
Hankey K
-
8 is a small neighborhood school with a huge heart 
and  tremendous spirit.  We are proud of our 
accomplishments; implementing the IB program, being named a California Department of Education Distinguished School, 
a California Gold Ribbon School,  and a California Business for Education Excellence (CBEE) St
ar School, all of which create 
a small school, making a big difference.

Carl Hankey K

8 School has 32 
classrooms, a multipurpose room, library, 1 computer lab, a CTE lab for middle schoolers, 
and an administration building. The main campus (14 classrooms) was built in 1978. Portable classrooms were added as 
needed to accommodate our growing community. A mi
ddle school side of the campus was added beginning in 2007 and 
completed in 2009. These new classrooms dedicated to the middle school included a music room, a PE room and 2 new 
science labs. We also expanded our cafeteria and additional lunch seating and s
hade structures were  set up to meet the 
needs of our expanding enrollment. During this process, new elementary classrooms were also completed which now 
accommodate our 4th and 5th grade classes, Speech, elementary Spanish, a Mommy and Me class and a presc
hool.
 
 
In the past few years, the school has had new air conditioning units installed, library renovations,  internet wiring 
throughout the school, a new phone/PA system, new lunch table shaded structures, and new playground equipment. In 
2012 we updated b
oth the elementary and middle school computer labs, phasing out older computers and improving the 
internet connectivity. The media center in the main building houses our library (for both middle and elementary) and the 
elementary computer lab.  Last summer
 
the middle school computer lab was repurposed into a innovative CTE Lab, 
providing our middle school students with advanced technology incorporated into 12 work stations. This year we added 
a school garden, providing students with the opportunity to watch
 
plants grow, learn about gardening and composting, 
and  experience tasting new vegetables.

-

At our school large 
numbers of parents volunteer. Parents volunteering in our classrooms assist individuals or small groups 
of students, help with Art Masters, and do clerical work for classroom teachers. Each month a parent volunteer who has 
demonstrated exemplary caring (on
e of the IB Learner Profile attributes) is recognized at our K
-
8 Student of the Month 
assembly. Hankey has twice hosted PIQE, a weekly parent workshop focused on supporting non
-
English speaking parents 
with strategies for negotiating the educational system
 
and helping their students at home. This year we are excited to be 
working with Kid Healthy to bring their Parents in Action (Padres en Accion) program to our school.  Through this parent
-
led active recess and health education program, Hankey parents lear
n about school wellness policies, the importance of 
a balanced, healthy lifestyle, and are coached on facilitating structured recess activities.
 
 
Hankey hosts a PTSA (Parent Teacher STUDENT Association).  Our very supportive PTSA provides essential financi
al and 
human resources that enrich all student learning (field trips, the Art Masters program and primary music instruction K
-
3rd).
 
 
A second parent group, the ELAC committee, meets to address the concerns and needs of our English Language Learners 
(ELAC c
ommittee members are often a part of the PTSA).
 
 
Hankey is also extremely lucky to be supported by our school based foundation
-
Carl Hankey International Education 
Foundation (CHIEF).  Lead by the CHIEF board, this parent group is tasked with funding the sc
hool's International 
Baccalaureate Program. All members of the Hankey parent community are invited to support CHIEF through direct 
donations, volunteering at the CHIEF sponsored events, or heading the various committees working under the CHIEF 
umbrella. Fo

Capistrano Unified School District places great value on the role of professional learning, and utilizes systems
-
wide 
structures and strategies to promote continuous 
learning of adults that result in increased learning for students.  The 
ongoing focus for professional learning is to support the district's Wildly Important Goal for Teaching and Learning.  It is 
the district goal to engage students in meaningful, challen
ging, and innovative educational experiences to increase post
-
secondary options for all students.
 
 
It is the goal of  Capistrano Unified School District to ensure all students receive Great First Instruction (GFI).  The visi
on 
for GFI is that all 
learning environments include Lesson Preparation, Interaction, Strategies, and Review and Assessment 
as defined by the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP).  By design, the model for providing professional 
learning is multi
-
tiered, and ranges 
from large
-
scale, district
-
wide learning opportunities focused on priority areas to site
-
specific, embedded professional learning (including coaching) that supports teachers in the transfer of that learning to the 
classroom. In addition, professional learn

school hours to further support district initiatives and teacher needs for ongoing professional learning. The outcome of all 
CUSD professional learning is to improve educator effecti
veness in order to increase student learning. In support of this 
outcome, administrators participate in professional learning to increase their knowledge of quality practices, California 
Content Standards, and strategies for instructional leadership.

Sinc
e 2004, all schools provide specific release time for embedded professional learning using late start or early release 
days.  In grades K
-
8, this time is known as ACE time (Articulation and Collaboration for Excellence).  The purpose of this 
time is for ed
ucators to examine the impact of their practice on student learning, with a focus on continuous improvement.  
Schools work to identify key areas of learning based on an analysis of student data, upon which they place their focus for 
professional learning a
nd set annual measurable goals based upon those identified areas of need. These areas are 
determined through the analysis of student learning data from multiple sources, including, but not limited to high stakes 
testing. The action plan developed to accomp
lish these goals outlines priorities for teacher training and implementation.
 
 
Throughout the year, the structure of collaboration typically involves teacher teams engaging in ongoing examination of 
standards
-
based curriculum, the examination of meaningful
 
formative and summative assessment data, and powerful 
teaching strategies that get results in student learning. In 2017 the District developed the CUSD Professional Learning 

ll collaborative teams utilize Common 
Goals, Relational Trust, Focus on Learning, Shared Responsibility, Action
-
Oriented, Data Driven, and Systems and 
Structures for Support  to ensure all students are learning at high levels.  These embedded professional 
learning activities 
help prepare teams to provide a differentiated instructional program that meets the needs of all students.
 
 
Beginning teachers receive systematic training and support during their first two years of teaching within the CUSD 
Induction Pr
ogram. This program assists new teachers as they build upon the skills they already possess upon entering the 
field of teaching, and provides them with support from a veteran teacher. The program is approved by the California State 
Commission on Teacher Cr

to those activities previously described, all teachers may receive support, assistance, and opportunities to grow 
professionally through their participation in sc
hool site learning teams, student study teams, from district resource 
teachers, and the Peer Assistance and Review Program.
