By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Centr

contractors, routine facilities maintenance projects, special projects, and school inspections. The most recent facilities 
inspection at Cen
tral School was conducted during the month of August (2019). Central School provides a safe, clean 
environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance and campus supervision. Ongoing maintenance ensures 
school facilities are kept safe and in goo
d working condition and continue to provide adequate space for students and 
staff. 
 
 

playgrounds, classrooms, and campus grounds are well
-
maintained and kept very clean, safe and functioning for students, 
staff, visitors and community 
organizations that frequently use the campus facilities. One full
-
time day custodian and a 
team of evening custodians are assigned to the school and work closely with the principal for routine maintenance, daily 
custodial duties, and special events. The ev
ening team of custodians is responsible for daily cleaning of both Central School 
and Stratford School. The principal and day custodian communicate daily regarding school facilities and maintenance 
issues. 
 
 
The custodian inspects facilities every day for 
safety hazards or other conditions that need attention prior to students and 
staff entering school grounds. During the school day, all staff members survey grounds as a part of their daily routines to 
keep facilities safe and secure. The custodian performs
 
routine room
-
by
-
room inspections to identify conditions that 
require correction. Any graffiti or signs of vandalism are removed prior to students

District has received a grant under the 
Drinking Water for Schools Program, and will be purchasing and replacing drinking 
fountains throughout the school, as well as installing point of use filtration systems as an interim solution for the water 
quality issues. The District continues to work wit
h the State Water Resources Control Board for a long term solution for 
the water quality issues.
 
 
In the interim, the District continues to provide clean, potable drinking water for all students and staff, as there is the 
utmost desire for safety of our co

(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CA
As items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and

The parents of Central School students support their children, the school, and the community by helping their children at 
home with their school work, providing a caring environment, and by attending conferences, programs, and athletic
/ 
academic events. The many parent volunteers at school serve as classroom helpers, assist with fundraisers, and organize 
school activities. Parents may serve on decision
-
making committees such as the School Site Council (SSC), District Advisory 
Council (D
AC), District English Learner Advisory Council (DELAC), Migrant Committee, and Indian Education Committee 
(IEC). The Parent
-
Teacher Club provides funds and support for assemblies, uniforms, playground equipment, and many 
other extra benefits for the school
 
and its students.
 
 
 
Central School established a School Advisory Council in accordance with Economic Impact Aid funding requirements. This 
governing body is comprised of elected parents and school staff members. Council members are responsible for providi

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan was developed for Central School in collaboration with local 
agencies and 
District administration to fulfill Senate Bill 187 requirements. Components of this plan include child abuse reporting 
procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe arrival 
an
d department from school, sexual harassment policy, dress code policy, and bully prevention policy. The most current 
school site safety plan was reviewed, updated, and shared with school staff in August 2019 at a staff meeting. Components 
of the safety pla
n are regularly reviewed at weekly plant meetings, instructional aide meetings and faculty meetings.  An 
updated copy of the school site safety plan is available to the public at the Central Union School District office and the 
school site.
 
In addition, ex
ercises or drills (i.e. fire drills, lockdown drills, earthquake drills, etc.) are also reviewed and held 
during the school year.

Central Union School District and its four school sites combine efforts to provide training and curriculum development 
based on the California Standards and are aligned with the content of the curriculum frameworks for grades kindergarten 
through eight. Te
achers within the District align classroom curriculum to ensure that all students either meet or exceed 
state proficiency levels. 
 
 


to focus on the 
Professional Learning Communities (PLC). Grade Level Teams have work to identify Essential Standards 
Districtwide to ensure that all students are achieving. The District continues to partner with Solution Tree to support our 
learning community process thro
ugh training and coaching for our educators. 
 
 
A Multi
-
Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) Leadership Team was developed in 2017
-
18. This team did extensive research 
and received training through participation in a successful grant application. This group beg
an with a focus on the Social
-
Emotional and Behavioral needs of students. Based on their findings, they provided training on Connectedness to 
administrators and staff. An ongoing needs assessment was conducted at each site to provide information for next s
teps. 
Over time, we can expect to see continued improvement in school culture as well as student achievement as a result of 
this research
-
based practice.
