About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC
). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCA
P), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more i
nformation about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority
: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district make
s to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Fallbrook Homeschool Academy is committed to working with our parents to extend and enrich the school expe
rience for all students. We believe in 
providing parents and families with regular communication through our school website, Peachjar flyers, "all calls," social me
dia feeds, and our weekly 
communication folders. As a home school program parents are an int
egral part of the school, as they are responsible for instruction at home.  We 
welcome parents on our campus as well as frequent parent
-
teacher
-
student conferences, Coffee and Conversation with the Principal, and other 
scheduled family
-
home connected event
s.  We offer opportunities for parents to volunteer, participate in parent workshops, and engage at our site. We 
encourage parents and community members to join the Parent Teacher Association (PTA).  For more information regarding parent 
involvement 
opport
unities please contact the site administration or your child's teacher.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Each Fallbrook Union Elementary School District site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan* (CSSP), including a disast
er preparedness plan 
annually. School administrators work closely 
with local law enforcement, fire department and/or the Provost Marshall's Office on Camp Pendleton who 
review the plans and also participate in emergency drills, provide feedback, attend site and district safety meetings and col
laboratively help to improve
 
overall campus safety, climate, and security.  Copies of the Comprehensive School Safety Plans are available for review at ea
ch school office. The plan 
includes emergency procedures for school safety, natural disasters, and campus intruders. It also conta
ins appropriate strategies and programs that will 

d to school safety. Students, 
teachers, and staff are trained to prepare for a wi
de range of emergency situations, and frequent drills help to refine emergency skills, policies, and 
procedures at all school sites. Following each drill, specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to co
ntinually improve emergency 
pr
ocedures, and improve campus safety.

Finally, school and district administrators immediately investigate threats of harm. Teachers and administrators seek to fost
er lines of open 
communication so students and parents feel comfortable reporting inappropria
te activity including bullying, harassment, or threats. All FUESD staff take 
a strong stand against threatening behavior or bullying and investigate complaint matters fully. Many positive programs exist
 
districtwide to enhance 
and continually improve schoo
l culture and climate, including Positive Behavior Intervention and Support, Restorative Practices, Suicide Prevention, Anti
-
Vaping Education and Trauma
-
Informed Practices.
 
 
*The Fallbrook Homeschool Academy students and staff are included in the La Paloma
 
Elementary CSSP and work collaboratively to meet student safety 
needs.
