About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Lakeside Middle School has a rich history in our community. It was opened in 1917 as a high school with the oldest building, 
bui
lt in 1937, still standing. 
Despite the age, the building is in fine condition and is well maintained by our maintenance department. Other buildings were
 
added through the decades 
including physical education rooms, a complete woodshop, a multipurpose room
, a band room, and a library. The cooking classroom has been converted 
to a choral music and dance classroom.
 
 
Beginning in April 2011, Lakeside Middle School received six million dollars in upgrades from a bond initiative that was pass
ed by voters.  The r
emodeling 
was completed in January, 2012.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cog
nitive disabilities); and

Parents are valued members of the LMS school community and actively work with Lakeside Middle School staff to create a safe, 
positive climate for 
student achievement. They serve as members of PTSA, School Site Council, English
 
Learner Advisory Committee, District English Learner Advisory 
Committee, District Advisory Committees, Schools of the Future Committee and the District Safety Committee.
 
 
Our Dynamic PTSA leaders advocate for student achievement, school safety, and parent
 
involvement. Goals include supporting the health, safety, and 
well
-
being of students through programs and materials, increasing parent involvement, and volunteerism by providing monthly family
 
events that 
encourage parent
-
child interaction and supporting 
arts and science enrichment that sets Lakeside Middle School above other campuses.
 
 
Parent involvement and support of student performances in dance, art, theater, band, orchestra, FFA, and athletics programs a

school lea
ders to ensure that all school sites from kindergarten through 12th grade communicate using consistent procedures. We conduct
 
monthly fire, earthquake, lockdown, and campus security procedures and discuss safety procedures in classes and assemblies. U
pdate
d safety procedures 
are posted near each office phone and in each classroom.
 
 
Teaching staff and administration move about the campus, checking student passes, monitoring restrooms, directing campus visi
tors and alerting the 
office of potential concerns. Administrators are visible during high
-
density periods and remain on campus in 
the evening following dismissal to ensure 
that each student has exited the campus safely or arrived at their afterschool program. Cameras installed throughout the camp
us add to the safe campus 
atmosphere. The double lunch schedule has reduced crowding at l
unch, increased the ratio of supervisors to students, and enhanced safety.
 
 
The LMS PTSA will help support all LMS students by providing programs, assemblies, and the proper items and materials that re

school shooting. This powerful program is continuing through peer training to inspire, equip, and empower students to make a 
difference in their world 
through leadership and social
-
emotional skill training. Both programs are further woven into
 
school culture by trained Peer Ambassador Leaders (PALS), 
who are guided and trained by our school counselor and work with fellow students to help with problem
-
solving and positive role modeling. These school 
and community resources have lead to a peacefu

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. 

of time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional developmen
t.
 
 
Across the District:
 
SCIENCE 

 
 
The primary areas of focus for staff and administrator development have been related to the adoption of the Next Generation S
cience Standards (NGSS) 
and moving teachers and administrators into implementation.  Focus area
s include: 1) Building leadership capacity, 2) Scaling up Professional Learning 
and Support to include all district teachers, 3) Planning instruction aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards, 4) Co
llaborative planning tools for 
instruction, and 5) 
Addressing supplemental instructional materials.
 
 
Professional development needs were determined via district
-
wide Needs Assessment Surveys, LUSD Core Leadership Team/California Next Generation 
Science Standards Early Implementation Initiative, and feedbac
k data collected via prior professional learning events in the district.

Professional Learning for the 2018
-
2019 school year will address all levels/cohorts of teachers and administrators in the district through continued 
leadership, pedagogy, and content
 
training.  This will occur primarily through science lesson study for all TK
-
8 teachers of science to include MS ELA 
teachers, an intensive summer institute, district Professional Development days, and a review of publisher materials.
 
 
Core Leadership Tea
m and established Teacher Leaders will continue to receive training in the areas of Leadership, Facilitation of Professional 
Learning 
for their peers, and deepening understanding of NGSS innovations, planning, and pedagogy via the NGSS Early Implementation
 
Initiative Program.  

Teacher Leader peers through 
the established lesson study model, Summer Institute opportunities, and district
 
PD days.
 
Other opportunities for science professional learning include supplemental material/planning work supported by a CA Regional 
Environmental Education 
Community (CREEC) partnership, and instructional material evaluation.
 
 
Administrator professional
 
learning will address NGSS innovations, strategies to identify and support high quality science instruction (observations and
 
feedback) and sustainability.  This support will occur both on site and through district management meetings via the Early Im
plem
enter Initiative.

MATH 

 
 
LUSD
 
focused on mathematics as a professional development goal in response to low performance scores on the CAASPP and to support 
teachers in the 
Common Core Standards for Mathematics.
 
 
Professional development in mathematics is delivered in three primary ways
:  1) Workshops (after school, on professional growth days, and during 
teacher release time), 2) Individual and small group site
-
based coaching/mentoring, and 3) Conference attendance.
 
 
Teachers are supported in refining their mathematics instruction and u
se of curriculum materials through: 1) Workshops focused on the content and 
pedagogy relevant to the math content they teach, vertical progression of content, and the Common Core content and practice s
tandards 2) 
Workshops/guided collaboration focused on u
nit and lesson design with their curriculum materials (within school and cross
-
school), 3) In
-
class coaching 
both in one
-
on
-
one and small groups, and 4) Lesson Study in grade
-
level groups.  Additionally, principals attend all teacher professional learning 
activities 
and receive additional training from a leadership perspective.
 
 
 
Social/Emotional/Behavioral Support 
-
 
 
Social
-
emotional learning and support and behavioral support are focus areas in the 18
-
19 school year.
 
PBIS remains in place at all sites. School Counselors continue the work of supporting the social and emotional needs of stude
nts.   Two Behavior Speciali
sts 
and two Behavior Intervention Aides are also available to support students with the most intensive behavioral needs.  Two MTS
S Teachers on Special 
Assignment (TOSAs) were added to support the development of social/emotional/behavioral intervention syst
ems at four of our Elementary sites.
 
 
Professional Development and Coaching have focused on Conscious Classroom Management strategies.  Conscious Classroom Teachin
g provides teachers 
with professional development and coaching on Tier I and II behavioral st
rategies.  MTSS TOSAs are also available to coach on classroom management 
strategies and student behavior plans.
 
 
Leadership 
-
 
 
Lakeside Union School District continues to support principal growth through Professional Development and has deepened our su
ppo
rt of teacher leaders 
in the 2018
-
2019 school year. Teacher leaders (Facilitators) from each site received training in mentoring and coaching as well as conten
t support in 
mathematics and 21st Century Learning. The Facilitators, in turn, provide on
-
site co
aching to their respective staffs.

Types of Services Funded
 
LCFF funds are used in a variety of ways at Lakeside Middle School. In addition to classroom budgets, funds are used to suppo
rt after
-
school tutoring and 
to support arts programs. A portion of the funds go to staff development to keep teachers abreast of t
he latest innovations in education. A variety of 
specific programs, such as College and Career Readiness and Project Lead the Way are also funded with these resources. Variou
s technology programs 
such as Aleks Math, Jupitergrades, Vocabulary.com, Learning 
Upgrade, and Flocabulary are also funded. A portion of the funds are set aside for special 
events such as Science Week, Project Lead the Way, our River Park investigations and a variety of field trips.
 
 
To make comparisons possible across schools and distr
icts of varying sizes, we first report our overall spending per student. We base our calculations on
