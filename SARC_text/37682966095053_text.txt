By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the scho
ol, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., tes
t data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (dep
ending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Poway Unified 
School District ensures that students attend clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each of its schools 
is maintained in good repair.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained.  Playg
rounds and fields are ample and well maintained.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A night custodial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms and offices daily.  
The district has adopted cleaning standards for all schools.  A
 
summary of these standards is available at the district offices.

Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.

-
wide Positive Behavior Expectations:
 
 
We maintain a sa
fe and orderly environment through the implementation of our school
-
wide Positive Behavior Support 
Plan.
 
 
Our staff provides explicit instruction to each student on the behavioral expectations. As a school site we have three 
guiding rules that support our 
students and staff in all that they do: Respect Yourself, Respect Others, and Respect the 
Environment.
 
 
Character Counts pillars are aligned with behavior expectations and students, staff, and parents focus on 
positive values and behaviors for all stakehol
ders. A site Character Counts Committee, support from PTA (and a PTA Board 
position), and our elected Student Council Officers actively support Character Counts tenets.
 
 
 
Cheetah Catch:
 
 
Catch of the Day
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
certificates given to students doing 
their best.
 
 
5 certificates collected and the student is eligible to select from the treasure box in the office.
 
 
Cheetah drawings are held every three weeks 
-
 
Student names are announced over the intercom and come to the office 
to be awarded a prize.
 
 
Cla
ssroom Interventions:
 
 
All teachers utilize both classroom and individualized positive behavior systems. These are based on current behavioral 
research and involve the teacher, student, and follow through at home by the parent. When these classroom interve
ntions 
are not sufficient, the student receives a written office referral which is then addressed by the principal.
 
 
Office Interventions:
 
 
Office interventions begin with a written referral from a teacher or support staff member and include individual cou
nseling 
and mediation by the principal. This intervention is followed by a consequence for the student and parent notification of 
the infraction.
 
 
Student Success Strategies Team:
 
 
When behavior concerns are not sufficiently addressed through classroom or 
office interventions, a referral to the Student 
Success Strategies Team (SSS), is initiated. The classroom teacher meets with fellow members of their grade level team 
prior to the SSS to discuss and implement interventions. The SSS then reviews all interve
ntions and assessments and 
brainstorms classroom interventions for the teacher to try and benchmark goals for the student to work towards. Referrals 
can be made to the Student Services Program.
 
 
Programs and Assemblies:
 
 
 
"Too Good for Drugs" is provided f
or students in grades K
-
5. 
 
The Second Step curriculum is used to support our students' 
social
-
emotional growth and development and all students TK
-
 
5 receive instruction in this program. 
 
In addition, all of our 
students receive instruction in bullying pr
evention through the delivery of five additional Second Step lessons focused on 
the topic. 
 
Our PTA pays for assemblies with positive messages during Red Ribbon Week and helps to support Kindness 
Week and the Kindness Challenge.
 
We have a partnership with 
our local high school and once a month the Titan 
Ambassadors, students who serve as positive peer mentors, join our students during lunch to model and promote positive 
character.

Research supports the positive effects professional development has on increasing student learning. All teaching staff is 
afforded the opportunity to participate in district and site sponsored professional development in the California State 
Standards. 
Teachers engage in three full days and two half days of district supported professional learning each year.
 
 
In addition, our site 
engages in whole staff professional learning for two hours each month.
 
 
This time is focused on learning that supports our si
te goals and 
initiatives.
These workshops are presented in a semester or year
-
long series and support a wide variety of professional 
development. The area of focus for professional learning is guided by District and site initiatives which are determined by 
student assessment data and staff input and feedback captured through a yearly staff survey.
 
 
Survey data is analyzed by 
the site's Professional Learning Community Leadership Team and recommendations for the following year's professional 
development sessio
ns are generated.
 
 
The staff then engages in a shared decision making progress whereby the staff 
comes to a consensus on the site focus for the following year.
 
 
Topics include the use of effective instructional strategies, 
implementing the use of technolog
y in teaching and learning, critical reading, writing, mathematics, physical education 
and science strategies, effective use of assessments, positive behavior support in
-
services, and multicultural training. 
Teachers and administrators are actively involve
d in professional development activities at the school, district, state, and 
national level. The Poway Professional Assistance Program (PPAP) provides support for new teachers.
