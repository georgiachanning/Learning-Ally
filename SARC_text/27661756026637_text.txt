Description
 
 
District Mission Statement
 
The San Ardo Union Elementary School District is committed to providing the children of the 
community with a high quality educational experience to prepare students for secondary school, 
college, careers, and beyond. 
The school district strives to provide a safe and healthy environment 

increase their knowledge, self
-
worth, respect for others, and a sense of community res
ponsibility. 
The San Ardo Union Elementary School District is dedicated to providing students with the 
foundation they need to reach their goals.
 
 
Community & School Profile
 
The San Ardo Union Elementary School District is a single school district located 
in rural Monterey 
County in the southern area of the Salinas Valley.  The district is approximately 19 miles south of 
King City and 35 miles north of Paso Robles.  The school enrollment is approximately 114 students 
and attendance rates are fairly high (96
%).  The district was established in 1900. The district 
operates on a modified year round schedule serving 114 students in grades transitional 
kindergarten through eighth grade.  Enrollment has been fairly consistent over the years fluctuating 
from a high 
of 125 students to a low of 100 students.  Three similar small school districts surround 
the San Ardo District.
 
 
San Ardo is an unincorporated area with 517 residents, according to the 2010 Census count.  The 
economy is based on farming, cattle, ranching, 
and oil industry.  The majority of the residents work 
in the agricultural business.  Although the economic status of the population varies widely, 92% of 
the students attending San Ardo School qualify for free and reduced meals through the National 
School 
Lunch and Breakfast Program.  There is a mixture of single
-
family and multiple
-
family 
homes.  Many parents are seasonal field workers.  Approximately 30% of parents have an education 
beyond the equivalent of the 8th grade.   About 40% of parents speak litt
le or no English, even 
though the majority of them have resided in the town for over 10 years.  San Ardo School has an 
English Language Learner population currently of 89.5%.  The San Ardo School District had not 
redesignated students as Reclassified Fluen
t English Proficient (RFEP) for a period of seven years 
up until the 2014
-
15 academic year.  This has presented a difficulty in determining the accuracy of 
the current population of English Language Learners.  In 2014
-
15, (2) students were Redesignated 
Flu
ent English Proficient (RFEP) and in 2015
-
16 (1) student was RFEP, in 2016
-
17 (21) students were 
RFEP, in 2017
-
18 (8) students were RFEP, and in 2018
-
19 (4) students were RFEP.   San Ardo is not 
a migrant farming area, as most families that move to the tow
n tend to stay permanently.  There 
are no health or community services in the area.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
San Ardo School offers a safe and 
secure campus for students, staff, and visitors. The campus was originally constructed in 1935, and is comprised of the 
main building, which houses seven classrooms and the administrative offices, and a secondary building, which houses two addit
ional class
rooms and the 
science lab.  There is also a preschool modular building located on the grounds of the school.  Due to the age of the campus,
 
modernization will be 
necessary in the upcoming years.  The District successfully passed a General Obligation bond i
n November 2016 to address these needs. The District 
voted to issue $3.8 million of the General Obligation bond in October 2019.  Modernization construction is projected to begin
 
in the summer of 2020.
 
 
San Ardo School also enjoys three playgrounds, with o
ne specifically for kindergarten students, as well as a blacktop area and a track.
 
 
Safety
 
The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and State earthquake stan
dards. Earthquake 
preparedness drills an

defined 
procedures to accommodate crisis situations, and emergency supplies are available.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
The custodial team ens
ures classrooms, restrooms, and campus grounds are kept clean, safe and well
-
maintained. The district governing board has 
adopted cleaning standards for the school. A summary of these standards is available at the district office for review.

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

The primary areas of focus for professional development are English Language Arts and Mathematics.  It was determined that th
e school was lacking 
English Language Arts and 
Mathematics curricular materials aligned with the Common Core State Standards.  Subsequently, students were not 
performing well on California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress.  The District has since adopted new programs al
igned with the Comm
on 
Core State Standards.  Teachers participated in training for the new English Language Arts curriculum with a larger District 
at the beginning of 2016
-
17.  
Professional development has also included training from Project Lead the Way for implementation o
f the science materials.  Teachers have traveled to 
Universities such in San Jose, Chico, North Carolina, and Missouri to attend three to five day intensive training in 2016
-
17, 2017
-
18, and 2019
-
20.  The 
2017
-
18 academic year included professional develop
ment from the Monterey County Office of Education on Navigating the Smarter Balanced 
Assessment Consortium (SBAC), the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP), and setting SMART goals
 
to increase student 
achievement.  In October 
of 2017, we also began professional development in Guided Language Acquisition and Design (GLAD) strategies.  This 
professional development continued with in
-
class coaching and modeling through January and February 2018.  The District began the 2018
-
19 sch
ool 
year with professional development on Step
-
up to Writing and school safety training.  The professional development continue through
-
out 2018
-
19 with 
additional days in January.  Teachers also conducted a review of the new social studies and history mat
erials to implement a new program.  Several 
teachers and the administrator also attended a workshop in 2018
-
19 on performance
-
based assessment, balanced assessment systems, CAASPP 
performance task deconstruction, and creating performance tasks. The 2019
-
20
 
academic year began with professional development with the Monterey 
County Office of Education reviewing deepening math practices.  The professional development has continued with support provi
ders from MCOE 
observing and supporting teachers in classrooms
 
in mathematics and science.  Teachers also evaluate Next Generation Science Standards newly approved 
curricula and made a recommendation for an adoption for 2020
-
21. The administrator attends all of the professional development and facilitates teacher
-
pri
ncipal meetings to address issues with ongoing implementation.
 
 
Teachers are paid for two additional days of professional development at the beginning of the school year.  The current admin
istration has supported 
many days beyond the two provided and will 
continue to support them.
 
New faculty members may also participate in the Teacher Induction program, in which a facilitator works with beginning and ve
teran teachers in 
improving their skills and addressing the California Standards for the Teaching Profess
ion.
