By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

MISSION STATEMENT
 
The mission of Cameron School, in partnership with parents and the community, is to provide all students access to a high
-
quality, well
-
rounded curriculum rich in meaning and rigor that inspires: 
Post
-
secondary and career participation, critical 
thinking and problem
-
solving, technological literacy, and positive contributions to society.
 
 
VISION STATEMENT
 
Cameron Elementary School is dedicated to promoting students who are:  self
-
starters, life
-
long
 
learners, responsible 
citizens, cooperative, and effective communicators.  Together, in partnership, we accept the challenge of preparing our 
students to reach their greatest potential, committed to intellectual achievement, social

SCHOOL DESCRIPTION
 
Cameron Elementary School serves students from Transitional Kindergarten through fifth grade. Our school goals include 
having a 10% increase of students meeting or exceeding standards at each grade level in reading an
d math, having all 
English Learners (ELs) advance at least one performance band level on the English Language Performance Assessment of 
California (ELPAC), and to maintain a 97% cumulative attendance rate. To assist in meeting these goals, Cameron has the 
following programs in place:
 
* Kinder through 4th
-
grade reading intervention program taking place during the school day,
 
* Extended school day opportunities for intervention and enrichment,
 
* Saturday School Program to provide intervention and 
enrichment, as well as help students improve their school 
attendance,
 
* One to one technology devices for kindergarten through fifth
-
grade students which includes multiple software licenses 
to provide supplemental materials and adaptive intervention,
 
* Cap
turing Kids' Hearts to create a positive learning environment.
 
 
Cameron staff strives to address the needs of the largest subgroups through different means. Students in need of 
specialized instruction are mainstreamed as much as possible into the general e
ducation setting. The Special Education 
teachers work collaboratively with the General Education teachers to plan instructional opportunities aligned with the 
core curriculum. Modifications are made to make the core curriculum accessible to students. The T
eacher On Special 
Assignment (TOSA) has annual welcome meetings with foster youth to ensure they have all the necessary resources and 
supports to be successful at Cameron. Moreover, she monitors their academic progress and makes recommendations for 
interve
ntion as needed to help address any achievement gaps.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Much attention is paid to keep the campus clean and safe. Custodians, as well as maintenance and grounds crews, are 
responsible for inspection and repair of any safety items on a regular basis. No emergency facility
 
condit
ions exist. The school is well maintained by our custodians and district support staff consisting of grounds and 
maintenance. The campus provides adequate space for the 450 students currently enrolled. There are 25 classrooms, 8 
student restrooms, a librar
y, and a school administration building. The school has central air/heat, wiring to connect all 
computers to the main server, and Internet access in all the classrooms and buildings. The school has both a well
-
maintained cafeteria and a multi
-
purpose room.
 
The school's playground facilities were updated in the fall of 2017 with 
new playground equipment installed in the primary playground and rubber surfaces placed under both the primary and 
kindergarten playground structures. A shade structure was also plac
ed on top of the kindergarten playground equipment. 
Solar panels were installed in 2018 on two parts of the campus. The district conducted a wireless upgrade and network 
upgrade (network cabinets, switches, and battery backups) by December 2019. Network im
provements and new 
telephone systems are anticipated to be installed by the summer of 2020. In order to support student safety, supervision 
is provided before, during and after school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
Cameron receives School Concentration funds from the state government and 
Title I funds from the federal government. 
To support English Learners, foster students, homeless students, students with disabilities, and students not meeting 
academic standards, Cameron offers various intervention programs both after school and through 
our Saturday School 
Program. The focus of the intervention programs is to provide intensive instruction in English language arts and/or 
mathematics. During the school day, intensive reading intervention is provided to students in kindergarten through fourt
h 
grade who are reading below grade level.
 
To provide extended learning opportunities, funding is also allocated to provide enrichment to all students through either 
after school clubs or during the school day through a variety of classroom activities. Oth
er funded enrichment programs 
include participation in at least one field trip at each grade level. Because students have social
-
emotional and physical 
needs, Cameron Elementary School has implemented the Capturing Kids' Hearts program which focuses on cre
ating a 
safe, nurturing, engaging, and collaborative learning environment for students. Cameron participates in the 100 Mile Club 
which promotes student activity and healthy living by encouraging all students to walk at least 100 miles throughout the 
year 
for which they can earn special recognition.
 
Parent participation is an important factor that impacts student achievement; therefore, funds are allocated to encourage 
and support parent participation in school activities. Funds pay for substitute teachers 
that release teachers during the 
school day to have welcome meetings for foster youth and their guardians, IEP meetings for parents/guardians of students 
with disabilities, and SST meetings for parents/guardians of students who demonstrate academic struggl
es. The services 
and supports funded by Cameron site funds are inclusive of all students 
-
 
students with disabilities, English learners, foster 
youth, etc.
