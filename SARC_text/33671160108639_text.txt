By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our small rural area in Riverside County was known as the Meadows. Residents enjoyed the sounds of the 
hawks, owls, 
and other animals living and prospering in the great oak trees. Since that time, Oak Meadows Elementary School, Home 
of the Hawks, has worked together as a team to create an exciting learning environment where students can work, play, 
and achi
eve excellence. Our area has grown and is now considered semi
-
suburban. We operate on a traditional calendar 
and the 2019
-

students; this is a result of
 
a new school opening and boundary changes.
 
 
The California Department of Education (CDE) recognized Oak Meadows as having outstanding educational programs and 
practices by awarding us with the 2016 California Gold Ribbon School Award. The California Gold 
Ribbon Schools Award 
was created to honor public schools while the California Distinguished Schools Program, in which Oak Meadows has been 
awarded. Upon entering our award
-
winning school, one immediately senses this school is a special place. Educational 
r
ituals, traditions, and worthwhile community leadership projects continue to provide students the opportunity to work 
collaboratively while developing critical thinking and leadership skills.
 
 
As a professional learning community, we have implemented the C
ommon Core State Standards (CCSS) using the district
-
adopted curriculum. We enable each child to become a self
-
confident, skilled, and successful citizen, ready to embrace 


students, collectively, are responsible for student advancement and learning.
 
 
It is our expectation that the philosophies of The Leader in Me (TLIM) and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People will be 
developed, modeled, 
and fully integrated into everything we do. The goal of both TLIM and CCSS is to provide students 
with what they need to succeed in life. As students spiral upward in their education, they increase their understanding, 
deepen their knowledge, and expand th
eir abilities in both leadership and content. They become interdependent thinkers 
and problem
-
solvers. In short, they become a career
-
 
and college
-
ready
 
 
Parent involvement is a priority at Oak Meadows and directly connected to our success. We believe that
 
students, 
teachers, and parents should work closely together in an atmosphere of mutual respect and collaboration. Our school has 
implemented Positive Behavior Intervention and Support (PBIS), as well as the School Site Council (SSC) and OME 
Leadership te
ams. The PBIS, SSC, and Leadership teams continue to provide ongoing updates and data that promote a 
positive school climate and safe school.

Mission:
 
We will create and support a school environment in which all children and adults feel welcomed, respected, trusted, and 
an 
important part of the school. We will accomplish this by:
 

 
Believing EVERY STUDENT CAN LEARN
 

 
Demonstrating a personal commitment to the academic success and emotional well
-
being of all students
 

 
Supporting innovative thinking
 

 
Working together in collaborativ
e teams
 

 

 

 
Seeking and implementing strategies for improving student achievement on a continuing basis
 

 
Providing a safe and orderly environment
 
 
Using a 21st Century curriculum, teachers use formative and summative assessmen
ts to track the progress of students 
and promote an engaging, positive school culture. Using data to measure progress and to drive instruction is central to 
our educational values and beliefs. For this reason, OME utilizes an effective local assessment sys
tem to monitor all 
student progress and provide ongoing and consistent extension and intervention within the classroom.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The school district ensures that students attend clean and safe 

comprehensive scheduled preventative and deferred maintenance program to offset costly repairs and minimize 
disruptions to the instructional program.  The district maintenance staff ensures that the ma
intenance necessary to keep 
the school in good repair is completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure services and emergency 
repairs are given high priority. A complete and thorough facility inspection is done annually to identify f
uture areas to 
address and prioritize facility needs.
 
 
In accordance with Ed. Code Section 17070.75 (e), the district uses a facility inspection system to ensure each of its school
s 
are maintained and in good repair. A work order process is used to coordin
ate service and to address emergency repairs 
immediately. A full
-
time custodian is on campus throughout every school day. A night custodial crew cleans classrooms 
and office areas daily.  The custodial staff has developed a cleaning schedule to ensure a ne
at and orderly campus.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Each Menifee Union School site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP), including a disaster preparedness 

available for review at the school office. The plan 
includes emergency procedures for natural disasters and campus intruders. Students, teachers, and staff are trained to 
prepare for a wide range of emergencies, and frequent drills help to refine emergency
 
skills, policies, and procedures at 
all school sites. Also, following each drill, specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to improve 
emergency procedures continually, and therefore enhance campus safety.
 
 
OME staff exercises stri
ct adherence to the district adopted safety/site security protocols, which include a leveled/colored 

-
in using our Raptor 

Plan is reviewed annually; the entire staff participates in monthly emergency drills 
and provides feedback.
 
 
Finally, school and district administrators immediately investigate threats of harm. Teachers and administrators seek to 
foster lines of open commu
nication, so students and parents feel comfortable reporting inappropriate activity, including 
bullying, harassment, or threats. All OME staff take a strong stand against threatening behavior or bullying and investigate 
complaint matters thoroughly.

As a school district, we are focused on increasing academic achievement in English Language Arts and Mathematics along 
with increasing school attendance.   To this end,
 
our professional development strategy is geared to increase student 
engagement through the implementation of our district
-
adopted curriculum and the type of interventions we have in 
place.  Site and district leadership teams review achievement data on sta
te and local assessments to make determinations 
on staff development and training, to be aligned with yearly goals and projected activities.
 
 
MUSD provides two full days of professional development along with additional days as needed per site and data.  
A
dditionally, the major areas of focus have been on the adopted curriculum and intervention. State and local achievement 
data are used to make determinations. This district provides two full days of professional development along with 
additional days as nee
ded per site and data. Additional days are provided before, during, and after school by either 
directors, coordinators, or intervention specialists. Additionally, conferences, workshops, Grade Level PLC, and staff 
meetings are some ways of providing on
-
goi
ng professional growth. Many teachers and administrators continue to take 
college
-
level courses to enhance their teaching or administrative skills.
