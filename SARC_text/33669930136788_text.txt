Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Cleaning Process: The principal works daily with the custodial staff to ensure that the cleaning of the school is maintained 
to provide for a clean and safe school. The District's Board of Trustees has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in 
the Dist
rict. A summary of these standards are available at the Educational Support Facility for review.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and work orders are completed in a tim

priority is given to emergency repairs. While reviewing this report, please note that even minor discrepancies are reported 
in the inspection process. The items noted in the t
able have been corrected or are in the process of remediation.  The 
District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major r
epair or replacement of existing school building 
components. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor 
systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety Plan Vision: Our vision at Starlight Elementary School starts with establishing a positive school climate and culture 
that includes all students and staff. 
Since opening our doors on August 8, 2018, we have implemented schoolwide 
procedures and policies for our parents and staff through our Student Handbook, school website, and through staff memos 
and meetings. We operate under the closed campus concept to ke
ep the number of adults and visitors on campus at a 
minimum. Parents and other visitors must sign into the Raptor system upon entering the campus. To keep our staff and 
students aware of safety practices, we conduct regular emergency drills, conduct Positi
ve Discipline assemblies, discuss 
Hour Zero protocols, and conduct campus security meetings. Weekly videos are shown to highlight the activities of the 
past week and remind students of schoolwide procedures, including safe school practices. At Starlight, s
afety is the 
responsibility of all stakeholders.
 
 
In order to maintain a high level of safety at Starlight, the staff implements all site disaster and emergency preparedness 
activities, integrates schoolwide Positive Behavior Intervention Support as the fo
undation for our positive school culture 
and climate, and is working to create a safe environment at our new school site by making necessary modifications to the 
physical plant (gates, doors, parking lot, etc.)

Behavior data in our Illuminate student info
rmation system indicates that 43% of our behavior incidents occur on the 
playground and 31% occur in the classroom. We provide other means of correction before suspension through 
administrative counseling, parent contacts/meetings, and Tier 2 counseling to
 
assist students with tools to regulate their 
behavior. At the physical school safety level, we have installed door chimes in our SDC classrooms, submitted several work 
orders to add or repair items, and we have modified our parking lot procedures to impro
ve our arrival and dismissal times.
