School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019

Ronald Reagan Elementary School opened August 31, 1998, and is named after Ronald W. Reagan, the fortieth President 
of the United States (1981

acre site in the southwest Bakersfield community of Seven Oaks. The site features technology to support our 
curriculum in the basics as well as the sciences and arts. The Sc
hool Accountability Report Card was established by 
Proposition 98, an initiative passed by California voters in November 1988.  The Report Card, to be issued annually by local 
school boards for each elementary and secondary school in the state, provides fo
r parents and other interested people a 
variety of information about the school, its resources, its successes, and the areas in which improvements are needed.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Reagan provides a safe and clean environment for 
learning. A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the 
District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are maintained to a degree of adequacy that provides for good learning.
 
Ongoing repairs and modifications to the physical plant exceed Ca
lifornia Building and Safety Codes. The District verifies 
quarterly that OSHA requirements are met. The exterior grounds are well lit and the perimeter of the school facility is 
fenced for student protection and safety. A team of custodians ensures classro
oms and campus grounds are kept clean 
and safe. The restrooms are cleaned, sanitized and secured at the end of each school day with toilets in operating 
condition. As outlined in our Safe Schools Plan, the safety committee has addressed concerns for the sa
fe coming and 
going of our students. Staff receives inservice in emergency protocol and CPR. Identifying tags are issued to volunteers 
and other visitors as they register in our office through the Raptor System. The gates on the perimeter of the school 
pla
yground are locked during school hours and staff members are trained to activate lockdown procedures in the event 
of an emergency. Our positive partnership with local law enforcement is evident in their quick response time when 
concerns arise.  Both a hosp
ital an fire station are located within a mile of our campus. Designated staff members carefully 
supervise students on the playground and in the cafeteria. Grounds and playground equipment are inspected regularly 
for potential hazards. The District provide
s on
-
going training in CPR/First Aid as part of its staff development program. 
Fire, Earthquake, Lockdown, Lockout, and/or disaster drills occur monthly and a complete school site disaster plan has 
been prepared and is in place and available for public rev
iew. Scheduled certificated supervision of students begins 
officially at 7:20 a.m. when the school opens and supervision ends at 2:50 p.m.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Reagan Elementary establishes guidelines to provide students with a meaningful, productive, and enjoyable school 

opportunities to learn self
-
discipline 
through a system of rewards and consequences for their behavior.   Reagan uses the Positive Behavioral Interventions and 
Supports (PBIS)  to teach children the expected behaviors on our school campus. Appropriate beha
vior is encouraged 
through praise and motivational incentives as well as assertive discipline and conflict resolution tools to further develop 
personal growth.   Reagan Elementary believes students who develop a sense of personal responsibility will mature
 
both 
academically and emotionally.  Informal character education to promote positive, responsible students takes place 
throughout the school year in the classrooms. Parents and students are informed of discipline policies at the beginning of 
each school y
ear through orientation as well as individual parent
-
student handbooks.   Suspensions and expulsions occur 
only when appropriate or when all other alternatives are exhausted.
 
 
Students with excessive tardies, truancies or unexcused absences may be subject 
to disciplinary action including detention 
and mandatory parent conferences through the Attentions 2 Attendance. We truly believe that missing school is missing 
out. The District has established an Independent Study Program for students who must be absent 
from school due to 
illness for an extended period of time.
 
 
Ronald Reagan Patriots are proud of the many achievements they have accomplished including the  California 
Distinguished School honor in 2002, 2010, and 2014. Reagan School continually ranks high 
in the California Standardized 
Test program. Individually, Reagan students have numerous achievements in the district and country in Oral Language 
competitions, Science Fairs, and Speech and Essay contests. Many of our students participate in the extracurr
icular 
activities available to them including: sporting events, district Honor Band, Orchestra and Chorus performances.
 
 
The Reagan School Site Council annually approves updates to our Comprehensive Safe School Plan (CSSP). A team updated 
our CSSP and 
our staff was given the opportunity for additional input on 9/18/18.  The Comprehensive Safe School Plan 
was approved by our School Site Council on October 15, 2019.  Reagan's staff will be presented a copy of the approved 
Safe School Plan at our staff mee
ting.  Yearly we continue to focus on improving student safety by updating and practicing 
disaster drills. Additionally, parents are repeatedly notified about safe driving, safe student drop
-
off, and safe student 
pick
-
up. With the addition of student atten
dance areas, we have made educating parents new to Reagan a priority.
