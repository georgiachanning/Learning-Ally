By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a 
School Acc
ountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Loc
al Control
 
and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with 
data 
repor
ted in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more 
informatio
n about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members
 
should co
ntact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
cont
ains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates,
 
dropouts, 
course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries
 
and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs availa
ble on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Nichols 
parents are offered a variety of ways to be involved:  school events, committees and trainings.  Many classrooms 
have parent volun
teers that work closely with the teacher to coordinate classroom activities and special events.  Parent 
involvement is encoura
ged through our FACE, PTA, School Site Council, English Learner Advisory Committee, African 
American Parent Advisory Committee and
 
Parent Education Sessions.  Nichols is host to a district FACE Parent Involvement 
Center that is operated by a FACE Liaison. 
 
The goal of these committees and the parent center are to increase two
-
way 
communication, collaboration, and engagement between t
he home/community and school.
 
 
A monthly newsletter is sent with information about school events and contact information for p
arents with questions.  
The phone messaging system is also used to disperse information.  Classrooms and Office communicate via Re
mind and 
Class Dojo applications.  Nichols has also developed online social media outlets utilizing Facebook, Instagram and Tw
itter.  
Materials for meetings, newsletters and phone messages are translated to meet the needs of our Spanish speaking 
families. 
 
Our goals are to build positive relationships with parents and to increase their knowledge of educational 
programs and practi
ces that make their students successful.  For more information, please contact Kristine Jones, 
Academic Coach; or Andrew Guzman ,

Number of school days dedica
ted to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Professional development is designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for administrators, teachers, and 
classified
 
personnel. Training opportunities affirm the basic philosophy of 
education that learning is a lifelong process that 
contributes to the well
-
being of the students, teachers, administrators, and community. Professional Development is an 
essential component 
of effective instruction and student learning.

All training revol
ves around identified needs of students and adults for the purpose of the improvement of instruction and 
increasing content knowledge. Central to all training are student achievement data, d
istrict focus areas, the Common Core 
State Standards, the state ad
opted standards
-
based instructional materials, and strategies to effectively teach the 
academic content standards to all students.
 
 
We also provided extensive professional development for Pr
ofessional Learning Communities through our Service Delivery 
Model
. On
-
site coaching and support is provided by academic coaches and district specialists for reading/language arts, 
mathematics, science, writing and social emotional learning. The district p
rovides time and resources for collaboration, 
planning, and profes
sional development. Additionally, we provided professional development on Multi
-
Tiered Systems of 
Support and Support to school and district teams.
 
 
Teachers new to the District received fou
r days of professional development prior to the beginning of the s
chool year 
focused on orientation to District and school site policies and services, Common Core State Standards, classroom 
management, curriculum and pacing, using technology and setting up
 
the classroom. Teachers in their second year with 
the District re
ceived two days of professional development prior to the beginning of the school year provided by the school 
site and focused on improving best practices.
 
 
New teachers with California preli
minary credentials received professional development through the B
akersfield City 
School District (BCSD) Teacher Induction Program (TIP). The focus of BCSD TIP is being mentored by an experienced 
teacher, growing in the California Standards for the Teachin
g Profession (CSTP) and meeting the California Induction 
standards
. The culmination of TIP is the recommendation for the CA Clear Credential. Each TIP teacher was assigned a 
veteran teacher who served as a mentor. The mentors received on
-
going professional
 
development in 
coaching/mentoring strategies, instructional strat
egies, and guiding cycles of inquiry. Professional development was 
provided through individual mentoring, monthly meetings, and after
-
school workshops.
 
 
Intern teachers received professional
 
development at monthly meetings focusing on the initial teaching 
skills of the CSTP 
including classroom management, lesson planning, assessment, and establishing a climate that is conducive to student 
achievement. Each Intern was assigned a mentor that pr
ovided day
-
to
-
day support in these areas as well as advisement 
tow
ard meeting credential requirements. Mentors received monthly professional development in meeting the needs of 
Intern teachers. Interns also received coursework and supervision from universi
ties partnered with BCSD to provide the 
Intern Program.
 
 
Teachers 
on Short Term Staffing Permits (STSPs) were provided mentors and monthly trainings on beginning pedagogy 
and best teaching practices. Each teacher on a STSP designed a plan to meet requireme
nts to move to a CA Intern or 
Preliminary Credential. Support was 
provided for required testing and BCSD staff worked closely with university partners 
to ensure teachers on permits were taking prerequisite requirements to move to credentials.
 
 
Teachers on 
Provisional Intern Permits (PIPs) were provided a weekly cohort me
eting focused on beginning pedagogy. 
Two cohort meetings occurred weekly to allow teachers on a PIP to work around university course schedules. Support was 
provided for required testing and 
BCSD staff worked closely with university partners to ensure teach
ers on permits were 
taking prerequisite requirements to move to credentials.
