By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Brookside Elementary was originally constructed in 2004. The school is comprised of 32 classrooms, a multipurpose room, 
a separate cafeteria with an outdoor cove
red eating area, a library in the main building, a staff workroom, a staff lounge, 
a computer lab, two playgrounds, and an indoor and outdoor stage.
 
 
Cleaning Process: The principal works daily with the custodial staff to ensure that the cleaning of the 
school is maintained 
to provide for a clean and safe school. The District's Board of Trustees has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in 
the District. A summary of these standards are available at the Educational Support Facility for review.
 
 
Mainte
nance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and work orders are completed promptly. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and the highest priority 
is given to emergenc
y repairs. While reviewing this report, please note that even minor discrepancies are reported in the 
inspection process. The items noted in the table have been corrected or are in the process of remediation.  The District 
participates in the State School 
Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar 
basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. 
Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heatin
g, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Brookside Comprehensive Safety Plan, in compliance with Senate Bill 187 of 1997, was last reviewed and updated in 
November 2017, by the 
School Safety Committee.  All revisions were communicated, reviewed, updated, and discussed 
with school staff in November 2017. An updated copy is available to the public at the school office. Components of the 
plan include procedures for disaster response
, child abuse reporting, school arrival and departure procedures, fire drills, 
and steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are conducted every month 
throughout the school year. Lockdown drills are held as nee
ded. An active shooter training was held for all site staff by 
law enforcement in December 2015.
 
 
Signs are posted at every entrance to the school and school grounds to alert visitors to sign in at the office. All visitors 
must enter the school at the main
 
entrance, report to the office, and present the principal, assistant principal, or an office 
staff member with proper photo identification and/or proof of identity. All visitors must report to the main office and sign 
in and out before and after each visi
tation (using the Raptor system) and wear a visitors badge while on campus. The 
school has rules and procedures in place that are in strict compliance with district policies and administrative regulations 
and will not tolerate disruptions to students, empl
oyees, or the school. Campus Supervisors assist the staff with student 
and visitor safety. Students are supervised before and after school by the principal, assistant principal, certificated staff
,  
and classified staff. The principal, assistant principal,
 
and classified staff members supervise students during lunch and 
break periods. There are designated areas for student drop off and pick up.

The Brookside Elementary School team believes that great teachers form the foundation of effective schools and that 
professional development is vital to improving the skills and knowledge of staff.  The school and District align their 
professional developm
ent offerings with rigorous state student academic standards, as well as the District and site 
improvement goals. Brookside Elementary School, in collaboration with the District, has worked to implement a 
professional learning program that is a comprehensi


plan for professional development.
 
To meet the diverse needs of student
s and staff, opportunities for professional development are offered at the school and 
District to provide training support for administrators, teachers, and classified staff.  The school team participates in 
professional learning which takes place during t
he school day, after school, and/or on Early Release Days.  Session formats 
vary according to needs and topics.  Some designs include: Professional Learning Communities, small group vertical 
collaboration sessions, small group grade level collaboration ses
sions, district level whole group training, individual 
coaching, and conference style formats. Brookside Elementary's assigned instructional coach provides teachers with 
ongoing support and co
-
plan/co
-
teach opportunities, as well as lead professional learn
ing sessions on specific instructional 
strategies. Administrators and instructional coaches conduct trainings, learning walks, instructional rounds, and classroom 
observations, and provide feedback, as well as coaching and support as needed. Teachers parti
cipate in learning walks, 
instructional rounds, training on Early Literacy and Phonemic Awareness, BELIEF, all Diistrict inservice days, training on 
AVID strategies, training on developing and implementing school

rovided throughout the year. Instructional aides, bilingual 
assistants, campus supervisors, library technicians, and other classified staff meets with District Coordinators and site 
administrators. Topics include skill improvement and strategies for suppor
