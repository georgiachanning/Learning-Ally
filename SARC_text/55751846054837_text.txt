By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or
 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
pr
incipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

nt a 

Big Oak Flat
-
Groveland Unified School District (BOFG). Its configuration is Transitional Kindergarten through eighth grade. 
The BOF
G district is a small rural district that also operates two necessary small high schools. Approximately 200 students 
attended Tenaya Elementary School during the 2018
-
19 school year. The district follows the Tuolumne River from the 
Northern entrance to Yos
emite National Park down to the Lake Don Pedro area, a distance of over 60 miles and 
encompassing 678 square miles. Tenaya School is located in the southern part of Tuolumne County. The school serves the 
communities of Groveland, Big Oak Flat, Moccasin, an
d part of the Don Pedro area.
 
 
Tenaya has faced declining enrollment over the last decade, however enrollment has hovered around 200 the last few 
years. This area depends heavily on the tourist trade as there is no substantial industry here. Approximately 
54% of the 
total student body participates in the Free or Reduced Breakfast and Lunch Programs. Special Education services include 
combined Resource and Special Day Classes. The services of a speech pathologist and a school counselor are also available 
on 
a limited basis. Tenaya Elementary Staff is composed of 9 full time certificated classroom teachers, 2 full time 
certificated special education teachers, 1 full time P.E. teacher, 1 part time art teacher,  a Principal, a full time school 
secretary, a full 

time Title 1 aides, 1 full time and 1 part time custodians, 2 full time and 1 part time cafeteria workers. The school follows
 
a traditional school c
alendar, and either meets or exceeds requirements for instructional minutes.
 
 
About Our School
 
Our staff and community are committed to the academic, social and emotional success of our students. All families have 
the opportunity to formally conference wit

the school year. Tenaya teachers are always available for parent conferences if needed or requested. The students 
identified as low performing during the school year are target
ed to receive intervention services. Some of these services 
include Title I funded remediation for phonics skills, reading fluency and comprehension, along with Freckle and Study 
Island computer lab assistance. SIPPS is available for 1st
-
3rd grade students
 
who need assistance in reading. Parents and 
community volunteers, as well as employees, work during school hours with these students. In addition, students who 
qualify receive special education services both in the classroom and in a pullout setting depen
ding on their needs. The 
school crisis counselor provides individual counseling to students. The Tuolumne County Student Attendance Review  
Board (SARB) panel also connects students and their families throughout the school year with needed resources. Free 
and 
reduced breakfast and lunch are available to those that qualify. Many community organizations assist our students with 
food, clothing, and personal necessity items, an excellent resource for our families.  In addition, they provide funding for 
field tr
ips, playground equipment and  school supplies. Tenaya has a strong force of volunteers who help in the classroom 
and provide tutoring assistance in reading and math.
 
 
Our teachers and staff use Positive Behavior Supports to limit discipline referrals. Ten
aya Elementary School utilizes 
Character Education to encourage respectful behaviors that decrease incidents of bullying, teasing, and other disruptive 

 
to 
encourage social
-
emotional learning such as self
-
awareness, self
-
management and relationship skills.

Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilitie
s); and

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety Plan is reviewed each year. The District adopted the  A.L.I.C.E. (Alert, Lockdown,
 
Inform, Counter and 
Evacuate) protocol in the 2013
-
14. A.L.I.C.E. Staff and students are trained yearly. The key elements in the plan are to 
follow the basic steps but when information is available to be able to make the best decision based on your locati
on and 
situation for the benefit of the students.
 
 
The safety of students and staff is of utmost importance at Tenaya School. A school resource officer has been assigned to 
the BOFGUSD since 2018
-
19 school year from the Tuolumne County Sheriff's Office. Th
e officer reviews safety protocols 
with staff and students on a regular basis. The teachers and classified staff supervise students throughout the day and are 
in constant contact via hand held radios. Visitors register at the office and receive a visitor b
adge prior to gaining access 
to the campus. Tenaya School encourages classroom volunteers and ensures the safety of the students by fingerprinting 
all volunteers. The school Site Council reviews and revises the School Safety Plan annually and the Tenaya El
ementary 
School staff participates in an annual safety training update. Safety drills are conducted as required.

The District supports and encourages our staff  to participate 
in professional development at district, county, region and

-
school or summer 
workshops at the county, and conferences in the region or state level. In 
the last year, staff has attended professional 
development for STEAM, math, Positive Behavior Intervention Supports, special education, art therapy, ELPAC and foster 
youth services.
 
 
All of the District in

-
emotional, and Behavior Support . These committees  meet regularly and discuss what is work
ing, problem areas and 
ideas for improvement. They examine discipline referrals, assessment scores and attendance data. Each committee 
reports to the whole staff once a month, providing new materials and training when needed.  Administration follows
