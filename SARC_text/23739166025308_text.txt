By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The District works hard at maintaining the facility. The buildings require ongoing maintenance and repair. The facility is in
 
good repair. Playground litter is picked up regularly. The staff has a ke
en eye for graffiti which is removed immediately. 
Monthly safety reports are completed by the site principal and forwarded to the Superintendent who also serves as the 
director of maintenance and transportation.
 
 
Age of Buildings:
 
The school has 15 classro
oms, a multipurpose room with kitchen, a library/computer lab, counseling and speech services 
room and an administration building. The District offices are also housed on site. Four classrooms were torn down during 
the summer of 2016 for new construction. 
Four new classrooms, two new bathrooms and a custodial closet have been 
completed and classes started being held in the new rooms at the start of the 2018
-
19 school year. The multipurpose 
room and three of the classrooms were built in 1957. The kindergarte
n, administration building, two elementary 
classrooms and five middle school classrooms were built in 1987. Several re
-
locatable rooms including the 
library/computer lab, and four classrooms were added in 1995. Three classrooms were demolished during the s
ummer of 
2019 for construction of one new classroom, custodial storage and adult bathrooms during the summer of 2020.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair:
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs are completed in a timely manner. The work order process is 
understood by all employees and serves as an effective system for promoting efficient service and that emergency repairs 
are given the highest priority.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
