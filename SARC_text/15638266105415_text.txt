By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members 
should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
d
ropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description
 
Golden Hills Elementary School was named a California Distinguished School in 2010. This accomplishment was due to the

Language Development, and through the Student Study Team process. During our instructional day we provide music, 
physical education, computer technology, in addition to a variety o
f activities designed to encourage student's academic, 
social/emotional , and physical growth. We use PBIS to teach and reinforce positive behaviors.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Golden Hills School has several active support groups: The School Site Council (SSC),  the Parent
-
Teacher 
Organization 
(PTO), and the English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC).  The SSC meets monthly and consists of six school employees 
and six parents elected by their respective groups. Cooperatively, they review the School Plan, develop and monitor the 
spen
ding of the Title I budget in accordance with the School Plan, and develop the School Safety Plan. The agenda is posted 
on the front window and on the school website. The PTO also meets monthly and supports such programs as PBIS, Red 
Ribbon Week, Character
 
Counts, field trips, and assemblies, to name a few. The PTO holds several fund
-
raisers each year. 
Additionally, our ELAC meets multiple times a year to facilitate parent involvement and input from parent and families of 
English Learners. Additionally, Gol
den Hills has a substantial volunteer program. Parents and community members who 
wish to volunteer attend a volunteer training prior to working with students. They help in a variety of activities such as: 
field trips, small group instruction, special class
 
activities, class parties and special events. Parents are an important part 
of making Golden Hills a safe and meaningful educational environment for the children. To learn more about specific 
opportunities for getting involved, please contact Principal, K
endra Bailey, at 661

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school has an 
established disaster plan. Staff, teachers and students are familiar with the appropriate procedures. A 
Comprehensive School Safety Plan has been developed and is updated each school year. The safety plan addresses disaster 
preparedness, various emergency 
procedures, child abuse reporting, discipline, suspension and expulsion, along with 
information about our Positive Behavior Intervention & Supports (PBIS) program. Disaster procedures and safety issues 
are reviewed periodically at staff meetings. Monthly d
rills are held to familiarize  staff and students  with disaster  
procedures.  Disaster  plans are posted in each classroom with emergency bags that include emergency contacts for 
students. Discipline procedures  and dress code are enforced  to provide  a 
safe and orderly environment  conducive  to 
learning. For student safety, once students have arrived for the school day, all access to the campus is limited to the main 
office doorway;  all other gates  and doors facing off campus are locked during school 
hours. Our school site is also alarmed 
and monitored by security cameras.

the site level. This year we have been working on Designated and Integrated English Language 
Instruction. Lisa Vargas 
form Kern County Superintendent of Schools presented at a staff meeting on Differentiated Instruction for English
