About the S
ARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local C
ontrol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to add
ress 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is i
mperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy 
(including ELA Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Linguistically Relevant Teaching and 
Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded t
hrough this program deeply align with the needs of our individual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and connect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional in
structional practices, 
assessment for learning, 
and lesson design.
 
 
Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outside of contracted hours. In addition to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the 
opportunity for teachers to engage in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening their content knowledge, strengthening their instruct
ional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared
 
sense of responsibility.
