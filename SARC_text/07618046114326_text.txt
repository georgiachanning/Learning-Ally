School Description
 
Tassajara Hills Elementary, established in 1997, is situated in an idyllic and beautiful setting with 
open hills to the east and south.  This suburban K
-
5 school located approximately 45 miles east of 
San Francisco in the San Ramon Valley Unified School Di
strict, serving a student population of 
approximately 500 students.  It has been recognized as a California Distinguished School several 
times, and most recently was recognized as a California Gold Ribbon school in 2016.  The school 
offers a rigorous, bala
nced, academic program.
 
 
Visual and performing arts are a hallmark of the school and parent donations provide weekly music 
instruction for all students.  Every child performs on stage annually in grade level musicals and 
fourth and fifth graders eagerly pe
rform in the school band and orchestra.   Health and fitness 
remains a high priority among staff, and students voluntarily participate in our "Stride for Pride" 
walk/run challenge weekly.  In addition to providing a challenging academic program, the school
 
community is dedicated to the development of the "whole child".  Character education programs 

conflict resolution and social skills. Fourth and fifth grade student
s provide leadership and facilitate 
community service projects emphasize the importance of giving to those less fortunate than us.
 
 
Tassajara Hills parents share our high expectations for all students.  Parents volunteer in excess of 
27,000 hours per year 
in order to support and enhance school programs. Parents are included in 
the decision making process through the Tassajara Education Foundation, School Site Council, and 
PTA.  Parent donations provide funding for additional personnel such as para educators
 
and reading 
intervention staff.  An extended contract for the library media coordinator and music teacher are 
also funded through parent donations. The close collaboration between parents and staff 
significantly contribute to the school's success.

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (
SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

School Safety Plan
 
Tassajara Hills is committed to the safety and security of ea
ch student. To maintain these conditions which contribute to the best possible learning 
environment, the School Safety Plan includes the following elements:
 
 
1.
 
School Crime Assessment: Tassajara Hills provides compiled school crime information each month 
for the California Safe School Assessment as 
mandated by the State of California. This information is analyzed at each school site to determine what steps may be taken to
 
reduce incidents 
of crime.
 
 
2.
 
Child Abuse Reporting: Teachers and other school emplo
yees are required by law to report any cases of suspected child abuse or child neglect. 
Reports are investigated by the Department of Social Services to determine if any follow
-
up on the report is necessary.
 
 
3.
 
Disaster Procedures: In order to ensure the 
safety of students and school personnel, the school safety committee has created a comprehensive 
Disaster Preparedness Plan. Emergency drills are held once a month and evaluated for effectiveness.
 
 
4.
 
School Discipline: Tassajara Hills has created a school
wide discipline plan in order to communicate high standards and expectations and to hold 
students accountable for their behavior. The discipline plan is given to every student and reviewed regularly. Staff members 
consistently 
enforce the schoolwide standa
rds.
 
 
5.
 
Procedures to Notify Teachers of Dangerous Pupils: If a student is deemed dangerous because of behavior at school or behavior
 
outside of 
school which has been dealt with by county juvenile authorities, the teacher(s) of the student will be promptl
y notified of the status of the 
student.
 
 
6.
 
Sexual Harassment Policy: Tassajara Hills strictly adheres to district policies which prohibit sexual harassment or discrimin
ation of any kind. The 
sexual harassment policy is printed in the school handbook and 
made available to all families at the beginning of the school year.  Employees 
are trained and advised of their duty to take prompt action if they become aware of any incidents of sexual harassment.
 
 
7.
 
Schoolwide Dress Code: Tassajara Hills 
believes that a clearly defined dress code contributes to a positive school environment. The primary 
standards for student dress and grooming include: the student should be neat and clean at school, and the student should not 
wear clothing 
that compromises
 
safety or modesty or that is disruptive to the educational process.
 
 
8.
 
Safe and Orderly Environment: Tassajara Hills believes a safe and orderly environment is necessary to ensure a positive learn
ing experience for 
all students. Regular 
supervision of students is the core of creating and maintaining a safe and orderly environment. Teachers, administrators, 
campus supervisors and parent volunteers consistently supervise and interact with students to reinforce behavioral expectatio
ns and sa
fety 
standards.
 
 
9.
 
Security: Teachers follow a schedule for recess duty on the playground, helping ensure that playground rules are adhered to f
or student safety 
at all times. We also hold monthly fire, earthquake, and Stranger

Tassajar
a Hills is committed to the safety and security of students, staff members and the community. To that end, a comprehensive pl
an has been 
developed to address various emergency situations. It is our belief that students can only thrive when they feel safe f
rom everything from earthquakes 
to bullies. Parents and staff members work together to identify potential hazards and take preventive measures. As a result o
f feedback and District 
safety initiatives, a fence and gates were constructed during the summer of
 
2019 to enclose our campus and ensure accurate monitoring of who is on 
school grounds during the school day.  Similarly, a new electronic sign in system was implemented in the office for visitors.
   
A school safety team 
comprised of the Principal, classif
ied staff, certificated staff and parents reviews the safety plan and ways in which we can support our students and staff 
around safety and security.  Regular practice drills of emergency procedures make safety a routine and allow us to get on wit
h the bus
iness of education.

The San Ramon 
Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a comprehensive, inclusive model of professional development for all staff.
 
Our high 
quality professional development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy an
d instructional strategies. 
We hold affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers' College Reading and Writing Project.
 
 
In addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach
-
led cohort to study instructional strateg
ies in a small group setting. 
These cohorts are both semester
-
long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for 
Innovators to Problem Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simu
ltaneously and teachers are able to select professional development 
that best meets their needs.
 
 
We ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project. Our summer intensive training,
 
along with on
-
going 
staff develo
pment days and release days, align with the needs of our individual schools and our Framework for Excellence.
 
 
the leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to deepen 
their content knowle
dge, 
strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of responsibility. 
As a result, every staff member 
helps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and t
he district as a whole is enhanced.
