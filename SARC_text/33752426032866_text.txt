the Distinguished Dolphins!ﬂ  
At Mead Valley, we take pride 
in our mission to ensure the academic, behavior 
and emotional success of EVERY student, 
while preparing them for productivity in the 21st 
Century.  Our highly qualified teachers understand 
the importance of student competitiveness in an 
increasingly global economy.  With their teacher

AVID elementary school where we will continue to 
partner with parents and the community to identify, 
set and achieve meaningful school goals as we 
collaboratively monitor our continuous improvement.   
Mead Valley received the 2019 PBIS Silver Coalition

STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT
DISTRICT BENCHMARK
 ASSESSMENTSVal Verde Unified School District uses a variety 
of tools to evaluate and analyze student learning. District benchmark assessments supplement multiple measures of assessment to identify students™ mastery of content, depth of knowledge, 
and skills. District benchmark assessments are aligned to the California State Standards and are comprised of both formative and summative assessments given in math, reading, and language arts. During the 2018-19 school year, 
all students in grades 1-5 were assessed multiple 
times utilizing a system of short-cycle formative 
assessments to identify content area mastery and 
specific gaps in the learning process.  Students in 
grades 7-12 were evaluated quarterly throughout the year to determine course grades and levels of 
content mastery. 
Multiple measures of assessment are used to identify student progress, understanding of state content standards, and mastery of subject area matter/concepts. These measures include: 
state summative assessments, benchmark 
assessments, grade level/department common 
assessments, classroom observations, teacher-
created assessments, adaptive diagnostic 
assessments in reading and math, and early indicators of reading assessments. Collectively, 
the benchmark assessments and multiple measures aid teachers in 1) identifying areas 
where instruction may or may not be effective; 
2) guiding classroom instruction practices and strategies; and 3) identifying students who need targeted academic assistance or intervention. Teachers and administrators are able to pinpoint 
any deficiencies or gaps in the learning process, identifying very specific skill sets and subject area 
content that needs to be retaught, reinforced, or revised to ensure every student obtains a solid 
foundation for future success in learning.CALIFORNIA ASSESSMENT OF STUDENT PERFORMANCE
 AND PROGRESSThe California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress (CAASPP) System includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments (SBAC) for students in the general 
education population, and the California Alternate 
Assessments (CAAs) for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities.  Only eligible students may participate in the administration 
of the CAAs.  CAAs items are aligned with alternative achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards 
(CCSS).  CAASPP results are a measure of 
how well students are mastering California™s 
standards in English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics, and are given to grades three through eight and grade eleven. SBAC tests assess student performance in ELA/Literacy and 
mathematics utilizing computer-adaptive tests 
and performance tasks, and CAAs test items are aligned with alternative achievement standards which are linked with the Common Core State 
Standards (CCSS). The CAASPP results shown in this report include 
overall results comparing the school, district and state scores as well as the school™s overall score 
in each applicable subgroup. Results are shown only for subgroups with ten students or more taking the exam. For those categories that are blank in the tables, no students met subgroup criteria. More information on CAASPP can be 
found on the California Department of Education™s 
website www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/ca/.

teachers are strategically stationed in designated areas and the principal, teachers and staff 
circulate through the campus to monitor activities and behavior. Teachers and staff are assigned 
to the cafeteria to monitor students receiving breakfast. During recess, six supervision aides monitor students on the playground. During 
the lunch recess, six supervision aides are
