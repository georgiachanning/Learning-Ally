By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg

.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

level content standards is a key focus at Vineyard STEM. We center our learning and teaching 
around 4 focus areas (authentic engagement strategies, increased rigor level, s
tructured academic language, and STEM 
integration). These instructional areas of focus serve to best prepare our students to achieve academic success on 
common core state standards. We celebrate and recognize student achievement during student of the month
 
assemblies, 
honor roll ceremonies and SBAC celebrations.
 
 
Vineyard STEM truly provides a dynamic learning experience for all students on daily basis.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Vineyard School first opened for instruction in 1958. The site has 9.34 acres of usable space. There are 98,065 square feet 
of asphalt, which includes playground and parking. The school originally had 16 classrooms and an administration building. 
A wing of
 
4 classrooms was added to the original site in 1961. Each classroom is approximately 960 square feet. Thirteen 
portables have been added between 1986 and 2011 to augment the original classrooms. Currently, thirty
-
three rooms are 
for student learning. Twen
ty
-
seven of the rooms have regular education students, one classroom is used for special 
education, one room is a science lab, two rooms are for technology (a computer lab and a multimedia lab), one room is 
the STEM Maker Space, and one room is used as the
 

primarily by the Think Together after
-
school program. A Multi
-
Purpose Room (MPR) is used for student meals and 
assemblies was added in 2006. There are three playground areas. The first is th
e Kindergarten playground, which has 4 
swings, 1 metal slide, team totter apparatus, ATV rocking seat, and a ladybug rocking seat. The Primary playground has 
safety compliant equipment for student play partially enclosed in a fiber ground. The equipment in
 
the fiber ground 
includes 8 swings, 1 metal slide, 3 plastic slides, a plastic corkscrew climbing unit, metal monkey bars, and a three
-
foot 
plastic climbing wall. There are 7 tetherball courts on a blacktop area. The Upper

School Safety
 
To promote safety, Ontario Elementary School is a closed campus; gates are closed during the school day and visitors must 
enter through the main office to sign in at front desk prior to entering school premises.
 
Visitors must present their 
California ID badges and staff must present their district badge through our RAPTOR system. Signage has been placed at 
all gates directing visitors to check in at the office. All staff members have been provided with district I
D badges. Ontario 
Elementary School offers student supervision before school, during school and after school. Supervision in the mornings 
is done by administrative team, support team, and noon aides. Recess duty supervision is offered by teachers, and noon
 
aides. Adult noon aides supervise lunch and lunch recess. After school supervision is offered by administration team, 
support staff as well as teachers.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair

Montclair School District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs n
ecessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that 
emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
The Ontario

Montclair School District takes 
great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist 
in this effort, the Ontario
-
Montclair School District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California 
OPSC. The results of this survey are available 
at the school office or Ontario

Montclair School District office.  The LEA 
governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the Ontario
-
Montclair School District. A summary of 
these standards is available at the school office or at the Ont

with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 

funds in order to 
assist schools with the expenditures for major repairs and upgrades. Typically, this includes the following: roofing, 
plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, floor, and carpeting. Each year 
the 
district matches the required allotment set by the state in order to participate in the deferred maintenance program.

throughout a walk through of our school. There were no extreme deficiencies found and one good repair deficiency. The 
found good repair deficiency was re
medied at the time of the inspection as listed in the report.
 
The Williams team noted that the visit was a positive, professional experience with a focus by the entire staff on seeking 
to improve the learning of each student at Vineyard STEM Magnet School

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.
