School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Hueneme Elementary School was modernized during the 1999
-
2000 school year. Modernized areas included
 
classrooms, 
cafeteria, library, computer lab, and the office. This process also included new wiring, plumbing, doors, windows/window 
coverings, floor coverings, ceilings, and a schoolwide intercom/fire alarm system. The parking facilities and large 
playgr
ound were refurbished in 2001. A beautiful new playground was installed for the Kindergarten and was completed 
in January 2004. An outdoor stage was designed by our local Seabees from the Port Hueneme Base and built by our 
Hueneme District maintenance crew
 
in 2004. In 2011, a new playground was installed for grades 1
-
6.  In the summer of 
2014, the exterior of the campus buildings was painted, rooms were painted inside, re
-
roofing was completed on several 
buildings, and the bookroom was refurbished. In 2018,
 
Hueneme received 8 new outdoor tables with attached benches.  
In addition, 8 outdoor umbrellas were also purchased.  This space has become a beautiful outdoor picnic area that is 
enjoyed by all grade levels and staff.
 
 
Our campus/facilities are clean, saf
e and orderly, and are adequate to meet the needs of our students and staff. Our school 
site is very well maintained, with litter picked up daily and graffiti painted over when found. Our school is starting to sho
w 
some wear after nearly 100 years, but the
 
facility repairs are done in a timely manner.  Staff input and daily inspections 
help identify repair and safety needs

which are resolved by our custodial staff and/or by our district maintenance staff as 
quickly as possible. Together, school and district
 
personnel work to ensure that the facility is maintained in a manner that 
assures it is clean, safe and functional as determined pursuant to an interim evaluation instrument developed by the State 
of California Office of Public School Construction.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

of the positive behavioral support program, C.H.A.M.P.S. (Conversation, Help, Activity, Movement, Participation, 
Successful Students), schedul
ed Saturday Attendance Academies, daily monitoring/reporting out of attendance, and 
coordinating safety for ingress and egress with the local police department.
