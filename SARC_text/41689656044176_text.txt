School Description
 
Oak Knoll is a big school of over 650 students that feels small, personal and focused on its mission: 
Every student an exemplary scholar, a valued friend, and a courageous citizen. As you walk onto 
our campus, you will noti
ce the focus is on the whole child. Learning is not limited to our classrooms 
but is accessible everywhere on campus. You will see children of various ages working together and 
learning from each other. You will see students who love to read, as evidenced 
by the large number 
of students who stroll around book in hand. In the halls, you will hear children as young as five 
playing violin, or classes of kids engaged in hands
-
on science, or small groups of students discussing 
their reading. If you glance into t
he open doors of our classrooms, you will observe students using 
technology as a learning tool, students engaged in dynamic lessons, and individual students sitting 
with their teachers receiving targeted instruction. You might also notice signs on our clas
sroom 
doors welcoming teachers to observe teachers! You will notice students taking the initiative in 
tending our school garden, planting seeds, and caring for the chickens. You will see students 
running the broadcast studio that produces the KNOL morning 
news and will watch the student 
tech crew doing sound checks behind the scenes at school
-
wide assemblies and performances. At 
recess, you will find children self
-
directed and participating in various games, sports and other 
activities, such as visiting our
 
bustling school library. During this time, you might also notice groups 
of kids in the Gaga (Israeli dodge ball) pit, which students advocated for, designed according to 
geometric principles, and then built during math classes. If you venture further into
 
our playground 
you will begin to hear the outdoor instruments, the large "big kid" sandbox (because big kids like 
to dig in the sand too), and the far off place called the Nature Zone where students work together 
using nature to build structures. While al
l of this is going on, over on our kindergarten playground 
our youngest students are riding trikes and building with our Imagination Playground (oversized 
foam blocks).
 
 
At Oak Knoll, our mission is our blueprint and keeps us focused on what we value. Exem
plary 

our students and parents. They understand that intelligence is not an asset determined at birth and 
that the brain is pliable and capable of amazing accom
plishments with practice and perseverance. 
Smart is not something you are; smart is something you get through hard work and practice. 
Developing exemplary scholars may be impossible without focusing on the whole child. We also 
emphasize students becoming v
alued friends and courageous citizens as part of our school mission. 
All three parts of our mission are equally important to us. We empower our students by providing 
many leadership opportunities in and out of the classroom. We prioritize and hold a high 
e
xpectation for compassion. Our fervent belief in inclusion for students with specific needs has 
helped create an appreciation and celebration of unique differences. We value diversity and 
celebrate race, language, and culture on our campus. Oak Knoll has m
any students from around 
the globe. Valued Friends are compassionate students so we make sure to teach our students to 
empathize with others and embrace diversity. Courageous Citizens provide service to others and at 
Oak Knoll service is not a special proj
ect, but instead, something Oak Knoll students regularly 
provide.

Oak Knoll believes in the power of relationships and connection. Teachers provide targeted instruction to students in the cla
ssroom who 
have not yet reached proficiency. This 
instruction is designed around academic goals and is also used as a critical time to deepen 
relationships. Speaking of relationships, our school staff also has strong working relationships which results in a lot of co
llaboration and 
school spirit. At Oak K
noll, we expect a lot of our teachers and put them on a pedestal because we appreciate and value the work they do 
to make Oak Knoll exceptional. Like our students, our teachers, are amazing!
 
 
Oak Knoll is fortunate to have a close partnership between the s
taff and parents. Parent volunteers spend countless hours supporting 
classroom teachers, programs, and events. Oak Knoll is a neighborhood school like no other! As we take our students on this e
ducational 
journey, we emphasize strategies that help them dev
elop a deep sense of self
-
awareness, self
-
advocacy, and self
-
confidence.
 
 
The Whole Teacher Framework:
 
Continuous improvement is a core value at Oak Knoll. In order to improve, our teachers and staff must understand the expectat
ions, 
engage in self
-
reflect
ion and set individual goals. We have created a framework that focuses on the most important characteristics for a 
teacher. This framework is called The Whole Teacher Framework. Just as we focus on all the elements of the "whole child" at o
ur school 
to ens
ure student connectedness and success, we also want to have a clear vision on what elements we believe contribute to teacher 
success at our school. The Whole Teacher Framework is made up of four equal components: teaching, connection, collaboration, 
and 
co
mmunication. All teachers at Oak Knoll are aware of these components and have spent time discussing, self
-
reflecting and goal setting 
around each component. Throughout the school year, Oak Knoll principals will meet with teachers one
-
on
-
one to check in and
 
continue 
the conversation. Resources will be allocated based on teacher goals to ensure progress and development across our staff. The
 
Whole 
Teacher framework is another import aspect of our overall vision.
 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condit
ion and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annua
l school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the Calif
ornia 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Oak Knoll School has 36 classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library, music and art facilities and an administration building. 
The main campus is 
approximately 50 years old. A major renovation of the facility was completed in 2010. 12 new classrooms and a ne
w multipurpose facility opened in 
September 2010. The field, playground, and parking lots were all replaced during the modernization work. W indows, door, and 
hardware were replaced 
throughout the existing school. Most recently, Oak Knoll School had the ro
of replaced on the original buildings. In the summer of 2015, the District 
performed a seismic improvement project on all the older classrooms built in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, classroom floo
ring was replaced 
throughout the school which had floori
ng that was about 15 years old. Interior and exterior finishes were painted as needed. Roofing was also replaced 
on the older sections of the school in the summer of 2015 and 2016. The District takes great efforts to ensure that all schoo
ls are clean, safe
, and 
functional. To assist in this effort, the Director of Maintenance and Operations and the site Principal conduct an annual wal
k
-
through to identify and 
prioritize necessary maintenance projects. The District maintenance staff keeps the school in good 
repair and working order by completing necessary 
tasks in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the h
ighest priority. Cleaning 
standards for all schools in the district have been esta
blished. The principal and Director of Maintenance and Operations work closely with the custodial 
staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of 
study

School Safety Plan
 
EMERGENCY AND DISASTER 
PREPAREDNESS
 
Oak Knoll has a well
-
developed emergency plan that deals with a number of possible emergencies. This plan is aligned with the Menlo Park School Di
strict 
Emergency Plan, the State Emergency Management System (SEMS) and the California Administra
tive Code, Section 560, Title 5.
 
 
District Responsibility: If the Superintendent declares a District emergency during the school day, all students will be requ
ired to remain at school or an 
alternate safe site under theEmergency care and supervision of Dis
trict personnel.
 
 
Until regular dismissal time and released only then if it is considered safe, OR
 
Until released to an adult authorized by the parent or legal guardian whose name appears on District records or their student
 
ID tag.
 
If students are on thei
r way to school they will be brought to school if bused, or they should proceed to school, or the nearest District school sit
e.
 
If students are on their way from school they are to continue home.
 
During a Declared Emergency, students, who have not been pic
ked up by their parents or other authorized people, may be taken by District personnel 
to another site where consolidated care facilities can be provided. This information will be given to the media stations to k
eep parents informed. In 
addition, the Distr
ict will utilize its emergency robocalling, texting, and e
-
mail systems as well as posting information on the website to communicate 
emergency information. Use of these modes of communication will depend on the ability to access them during an emergency an
d after we have 
responded to the safety of the students.
 
 
Please ensure that all your contact information is up to date and any changes are immediately reported to the school.
 
 
Parent Responsibility: Parents and legal guardians of students will be provided
 
with a Student Health/Emergency Form each year. In case of a Declared 
Emergency, students will be released ONLY to the person designated on this form. Parents are responsible for ensuring that in
formation on the Student 
Health / Emergency Form is current.
 
 
Parents are asked to share the responsibility along with the school for informing students of what they should do in case of 
a severe earthquake or other 
major emergencies. Parents need to give specific directions to each student to follow the policy out
lined above and to comply with school authority. 
School authorities will do everything possible to care for each student if he/she is under District supervision.
 
 
It is critical that students do not have directions from parents that are contrary to the Dis

in case of a severe emergency.
 
 
Oak Knoll Emergency Procedures: In the event of an emergency please remain calm and remember that your children will be taken
 

safety is our first priority. Oak Knoll staff will follow the Oak Knoll Site Emergency Plan and those policies set out by the
 
District Plan. All staff has 
designated roles in an emergency and a command structure exists. Each classroom is equipped with a Re
d Emergency Backpack and Emergency Clipboard 
containing a class roster, Student release/medical ID tags and first aid/emergency supplies and materials. In addition, the s
chool has emergency food 
and water for the immediate crisis and up to 72 hours.
 
 
Teach

be given his or her ID tag 
to wear. Students will be supervised at the school site until a parent or designated alternate appearing
 
on the ID tag can come and pick up the student. 
For this reason, it is important all information on this ID tag is current and those designated are someone with whom you hav
e discussed this situation 
and have mutually agreed upon an emergency plan.
 
 
In th
e event of a serious earthquake where building safety becomes an issue, parents or designated persons should come to the scho
ol as soon as possible 
to pick up your child. PLEASE DO NOT CALL THE SCHOOL. Phones will be needed for emergency information. Tune 
into local radio and television for 
community news and instructions.
 
 
Please, park on the surrounding streets. DO NOT PARK IN DRIVEWAYS OR PARKING AREA OF SCHOOL. These areas will be needed for e
mergency vehicles.
 
 
 
The annual Oak Knoll Staff training on o
ur School Safety Plan and Procedures was held on August 29, 2018.

During implementation and throughout the year, teachers meet with the principal to discuss student academic and SEL growth an
d progress. The EL 
Specialist also meets with
 
teachers who have EL students in their class to specifically goal set and provide specific strategies to support the students
 
aligned with the EL standards and continuum. Staff meetings also provide ongoing support for teachers during implementation.
