By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Maple School District is a single school, school district. The district has approximately 295 students in grades Transitional
 
Kindergarten through Eighth.  It is located in a rural, agricultural setting in Shafter, California.  It has over a hun
dred year 
history of high academic achievement, highly qualified certificated and classified staff, active parent participation, a 
beautiful safe campus setting, and a reputation for high expectations of student behavior.  In 1999 Maple School became 
a Dis
trict of Choice.  Approximately two
-
thirds of our student population is here through the District of Choice program.  
We have an extensive waiting list of families that would like to send their children to Maple as space becomes available.
 
 
The district po
verty rate based upon free and reduced lunch eligibility is 55.1%. Based upon current year enrollment, 33 
students at Maple are English Language Learners or 11.3% of our student population.  According to the criteria established 
by the California Departmen
t of Education, the three significant subgroups found in our district are:  White (not of Hispanic 
origin), Hispanic or Latino, and socioeconomically disadvantaged.  Our staff is dedicated to meeting the needs of all Maple 
Students, including those identif
ied as high achieving, English Language Learners and students in Special Education.
 
 
We make every effort to provide a high quality education for our students daily and use multiple local measures and data 
points to measure progress as well as provide supp
ort for any identified need. Providing an inclusive, well
-
rounded 
education and addressing the needs of each of our students is our goal. Our actions are all focused on working to achieve 
growth for each student based on their individual needs. We have suc
cessfully transitioned to a full inclusion model (with 
individual pull out time if needed) for serving our special education students over the past three years and have seen 
significant growth in the students engagement with other students, student progres
s toward individual goals and 
strengthened relationships with the entire school community. With a multi
-
tiered system of support and increased use of 
data to drive instruction we are exceptionally proud of the work that we have been doing to foster a growt
h mindset, 
knowing that we can all continue to learn and grow, for all students and staff.
 
 
 
Mission Statement:
 
 
Maple School is committed to providing high quality instruction as well as a safe and encouraging child
-
centered 
environment.  We believe that 
through the partnership of students, staff, and community, all students will develop self 
discipline and experience success.
 
 

 
 
Maple has three broad goals based on our Local 
Control Accountability Plan which are closely related to our mission 
statement:
 
 
1.) Maple School will provide high quality instruction in a safe, secure, child
-
centered environment.
 
2.) Maple School will provide challenging learning experiences that will 
maximize each students potential for academic 
growth.
 
3.).Maple School will partner with the students, staff, and the community to ensure that all students develop self
-
discipline 
and experience success.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Maple School students and staff enjoy the benefit of a well
-
maintained campus that is clean and provides a safe learning 
environment.  Classrooms and 
bathrooms are cleaned daily.  Grounds are well groomed; and playground equipment is 
monitored for safety.  The plant and its surrounding areas are continually checked to ensure a clean and safe environment.  
Staff members are encouraged to notify the M.O.T
. of any needed repairs in the classroom or on the playgrounds.  M.O.T. 
personnel inspects all of the facilities on a regular basis to ensure ongoing compliance.
 
School facilities provide adequate space for students and staff.  A scheduled maintenance pro
gram is administered by the 
district to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are maintained to a high degree.
 
 
The most recent facilities inspection was completed on 10/24/2019.
 
 
Since receiving funding last year Maple has been undergoing a complete r
ebuild. At this point all of our classrooms, 
Administration, library and playgrounds have been replaced. We are currently watching the rebuild of our multi
-
purpose 
building which includes a STEM lab and Student cook stations with a teacher demonstration ki
tchen to continue our 
tradition of teaching Home Ec (cooking and sewing) to all of our 8th graders. Our campus will be fully rebuildt by the end 
of March of 2020. .

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAAS
PP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through ei
ght and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant
 
cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or prog
rams 
of study.

necting community resources to our school and invite all constituencies within our community 
to assist us in supporting the education of our students.  Parents and community members are encouraged to become 
actively involved at Maple by volunteering in cla
ssrooms, attending school events, joining various committees such as the 
School Site Council, Maple Community Club, sponsoring field trips, and helping with fund
-
raisers. Parents are present in 
our classrooms on a daily basis providing support for our stud
ents and our staff. During community events we have many 
agencies willing to offer support including our local law enforcement and local high school athletic groups. We have strong 
parent representation on both our site council as well as our Maple Communi
ty Club. Parents are actively engaged in 
identifying goals for our school, providing input and feedback regarding our expenditure plan as well as providing feedback 
and input related to additional of enrichment programs. Parent input has resulted in increa
sed library access, the launch 
of an after school program, additional tutoring opportunities, installation of AED devices, and numerous other changes in 
recent years. Any person interested in becoming involved is welcome to contact Dr. Julie Boesch at
