School Description
 Mission Statement: CORE Charter School, in order to foster the educational pursuits of our K
-12 
students in rural Northern California, utilizes the independent study/personalized learning 
approach: supporting development through choice of curriculum aligne
d with state standards, 
engaging parents along with students in learning, and offering classes at our centers and within the 
community, with the goal that students will demonstrate measurable academic growth in addition 
to the social skills necessary for t
heir future success.
 Vision: To provide unique educational opportunities nurturing far
-reaching success for students.
 Motto: Personalized Learning for Student Success!
 CORE is a public Personalized Learning charter school, supporting families who home
-school their 
children. A personalized educational program is designed for each student. Since CORE is a public 
charter school, there is no cost to attend our school.
 Famil
ies are assigned to a credentialed teacher who provides constant direction for the 
parent/student/teacher team. This credentialed teacher assists the parent in the selection of 
curriculum from a vast array of state standards aligned texts, appropriate for 
each child's level in 
each subject area. The teacher then guides the parent throughout the year. Parents take the role 
of the primary educator of their own child. It is a challenging, exciting, and rewarding task.
 The school also provides support classes 
and extra curricular activity clubs at our school. 
Elementary students may choose classes ranging from academic support to enrichment. Some 
classes encourage advanced students to explore ideas and events beyond the regular curriculum. 
High school students 
are also offered a number of academic support and enrichment classes. CTE, 
ROP, junior college concurrent enrollment, and community instruction are all attractive 
components of our high school program.
 All students are given opportunities to extend learni
ng through parents' own creativity and 
exploration. The program affords an enormous amount of freedom to attend places and events 
interesting and valuable to the student, including field trips, assemblies, and school events.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the Smarter Balanced 
Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the Californi
a Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language 
arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may particip
ate in the 
administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are aligned with alternate ac
hievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards 
[CCSS] for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the 
requirements for entrance to the University of California and 
the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs of study

Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school dist
rict and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
CORE Charter School seeks input from parents/guardians in the school's decision making processes through a variety of opportu
nities. For example 
currently 2 parents and
 

body of parents and guardians. Parents also participate by serving on the advisory charter council and attending Local Contro
l Annua
l Plan (LCAP) public 
meetings. Our staff and parents work closely in collaboration with one another offering support in areas of expertise for stu
dent success.
 
 
We take pride in our "Open Door" philosophy, which encourages ideas and involvement. CORE striv
es to promote parent engagement in school programs 
and activities. For example our Parent Club hosts a variety of events, at least one per month, which contributes to our famil
y oriented school culture. 
These events require both parent and student involvem
ent in planning and operation, which the school fully supports by providing access to its calendar, 
website, resources, and staff oversight and attendance. Leadership regularly attends meetings to encourage engagement and off
er suggestions.  As a 
result th
is year parents 1) hosted a Parent 2 Parent workshop in which parents shared their experiences as parent educators, 2) offere
d availability as 
support mentors, 3) assumed roles with the school newsletter, door greet, supervision, new
-
family orientations,  
lobby and bulletin board décor, and 
fund raising events. As strong as this aspect already is, CORE has seen an increase in Parent involvement including the engag
ement of underrepresented 
families.  New
-
to CORE parents recognize the value of joining to cont
ribute to the family culture.

Professional Development provided for Tea

 Measure
 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 At CORE Charter, credentialed teachers are facilitators of learning, instructors proficient of diagnosing and assessing stude
nt progress, and continual 
learners themselves. We believe that on
-going trainings help teachers stay focused and effective as educ
ators. A regular staff development meeting 
calendar is created annually. Detailed, formal training begins for new teachers at the time of hire.  New teachers receive fu
ll days of training as needed 
in the independent study/personalized learning approach an
d systems. All teachers attend two days of staff training in August, which includes 
professional development in curriculum and technology, safety policies, and changes to program in general. Analysis of testin
g data and setting school
-wide and individual s
tudent goals occurs as the school year begins. Monthly staff trainings include curriculum and instruction support, department
 collaboration, individual student progress analysis, and development of student services.
 In addition, at the beginning of each s
chool year, teachers define the professional goals they wish to achieve. The school budget supports training for 
these individual choices encouraging staff members to attend workshops throughout the year to attain their goals. As the budg
et allows, teacher
s are 
encouraged to attend conferences including the APLUS fall conference in which teachers collaborate with constituents within t
he personalized model of 
education. This standard for professional development is based on the concept that what is good for 
the students 
 a wide variety of engaging learning 
opportunities, creating and solving real problems, using relevant experiences, and cooperating with others 
 is also beneficial for teachers as learners.
