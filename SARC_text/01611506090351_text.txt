Description
 
Castro Valley Elementary school (CVE) is located in the heart of Castro Valley, CA. We are proud to 
be one of the most culturally diverse elementary schools in the Castro Valley Unified School District. 
The school includes 5
00 students from a vast array of cultures, religions, and varying levels of 
socioeconomic status. We have the highest number and percentage of English Learners, with 
twenty
-
three different languages spoken on our campus. Our students come from families tha
t 
range from multi
-
generational Castro Valley residents to recently arrived immigrants and refugees. 
The implementation of a Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) and a high functioning 
Professional Learning Community (PLC) has enabled CVE to adhere to th
e District's vision of All 
Means All. At Castro Valley Elementary School we pride ourselves on creating a culture where all 

-
Tiered System of Supports encapsulates this vision.
 
 
MTSS was adopted to create positive stu
dent outcomes for our ethnically rich and culturally diverse 
student body. Our model program consists of collaborative, data
-
based problem solving that 
empowers our educators to integrate the two sides of the MTSS Triangle, Response to Intervention 
(RTI) a
nd Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS). Targeted RTI and PBIS instruction 
and interventions are delivered to students in varying levels of intensity, based on the identified 
student needs. Both the academic and behavioral supports enable 
us to form meaningful 
relationships with our students and families, prioritize LCFF and Title I funding, determine 
professional development opportunities, work towards closing the achievement gap for historically 
marginalized populations, and determine int
erventions and extensions that will effectively meet 
the needs of our students. We continue to strive to ensure that all students get what they need to 
become lifelong learners, reaching high levels of academic achievement. CVE is the place to be!

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every 
school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all loca
l educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Addit
ionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://ww
w.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and
 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Family, and the Backpack Food Program.
 
 
The School Site Council encourag
es input from parents for the

Compact and Parent Involvement Policy.  The English Learner Advisory Committee holds meetings to discuss their needs and ways
 
to access suppo

also send home weekly newsletters to keep parents/guardians informed of what is happening in our classe
s. Report Cards are sent home at the end of 
each trimester.

School Safety Plan
 
Student safety and security is our priority. Castro Valley Elementary's Comprehensive School Safety Plan is revised each Spri
ng by the School Site Council 
which is 
comprised of the principal, teachers, parents, and school staff. In addition, school faculty reviews components of the Compre
hensive School 
Safety Plan during the months of September and October when we reassess our school's systems for safety.
 
 
Our plan i
ncludes goals for creating a positive learning environment and a safe, clean campus.  Actions to meet these goals include: PB
IS booster and 
Second Step lessons, Unity Assemblies, Green Recycling Program and a Site Emergency Plan. Our site Emergency Team an
d PATA update classroom and 
school supplies each fall. Emergency drills are conducted once a month. Earthquake and secure campus drills are held each sem
ester and the site 
participates in the Great California Shakeout Drill each October. Teachers supervise
 
students on campus before school and during recess. Noon duty 
supervisors monitor students during lunchtime. All visitors must sign
-
in at the office and receive proper authorization to be at school.

CVUSD's two days of district provided professional development and our site based PD will 
continue to focus on Multi
-
Tiered System of Supports (MTSS). 
This PD will support CVE's current Response to Intervention (RTI) program which is an integrated multi
-
tiered system of academic and behavioral 
supports. Our academic RTI includes Tier 1 interven
tions implemented by classroom teachers, Tier 2 interventions implemented during grade level 
platooning and Tier 3 interventions provided by our RTI specialist and RSP teacher during non core instruction.  Our behavior
al RTI is also three tiered. 
Tier 1 in
terventions are provided by classroom teachers using Second Step lessons. Tier 2 and 3 interventions are provided by staff in
cluding our 
counselor, teachers, and support staff and include Check
-
In 
-
Check
-
Out, behavior groups and one on one counseling.
 
 
Tea
cher support and coaching is imperative for successful implementation.  Support structures in place include weekly built
-
in collaboration time. 
Teachers collaborate  within and across the grade levels to ensure that lessons are designed to teach grade leve
l standards and meet the needs of all 
learners. Professional Learning Communities include learning and sharing effective teaching strategies, evaluating student as
sessment data, reteaching 
lessons, pre
-
teaching lessons, and developing formative assessments
 
to inform student achievement. Workshops and trainings have included targeted 
professional development on Eureka Math, ELA common core and ELD instructional strategies. Teachers also work with our RTI Sp
ecialist using a coaching 
model. This provides teach
ers the opportunity to develop effective lessons and observe best teaching practices within the grade level.
 
 
As part of our cycle of continuous improvement, we recognize that students may be experiencing an opportunity gap. Our curren
t demographics includ
e: 
29% English Language Learners. In addition to designated and integrated EL classroom instruction done by the classroom teache
r, our EL Coach provides 
small group intensive interventions focused on English Language Development through an after school Eng
lish Learner Academy for students. The EL 
Coach also provides teacher training and modeling of effective strategies for EL instruction.
