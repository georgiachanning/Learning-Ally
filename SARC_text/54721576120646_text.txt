and
 
Mission
 
Statement
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
Strathmore
 
is
 
an
 
unincorporated
 
community
 
in
 
eastern
 
Tulare
 
County.
 
The
 
community
 
is
 
located
 
near
 
the
 
western
 
slopes
 
of
 
the
 
Sierra
 
Nevada
 
Mountains
 
in
 
the
 
San
 
Joaquin
 
Valley.
 
Strathmore
 
Union
 
Elementary
 
School
 
District
 
is
 
comprised
 
of
 
three
 
schools:
 
one
 
preschool,
 
one
 
elementary
 
school
 
with
 
separate
 
TK
 
to
 
4th
 
grade
 
and
 
5th
 
to
 
8th
 
grade
 
campuses,
 
and
 
one
 
community
 
day
 
school.
 
During
 
the
 
the
 
last
 
two
 
school
 
years
 
and
 
again
 
so
 
far
 
this
 
school
 
year,
 
Strathmore
 
Community
 
Day
 
School
 
had
 
no
 
students
 
enrolled
 
as
 
the
 
District
 
utilized
 
a
 
self-contained
 
classroom
 
on
 
the
 
Middle
 
School
 
Campus
 
to
 
place
 
students
 
who

(Most

Strathmore
 
Community
 
Day
 
School
 
was
 
originally
 
constructed
 
in
 
2002
 
and
 
is
 
currently
 
comprised
 
of
 
one
 
classroom
 
with
 
a
 
library,
 
computer
 
lab,
 
a
 
recess
 
area
 
and
 
a
 
greenhouse
 
with
 
planters.
  
The
 
facilities
 
are
 
specifically
 
designed
 
and
 
maintained
 
to
 
support
 
an
 
atmosphere
 
that
 
promotes
 
excellence
 
in
 
teaching
 
and
 
learning.
 
 
District
 
maintenance
 
staff
 
ensures
 
that
 
the
 
repairs
 
necessary
 
to
 
keep
 
the
 
school
 
in
 
good
 
repair
 
are
 
made
  
and
  
work
 
orders
  
are
 
completed
 
in
 
a
 
timely
 
manner.
 
A
 
work
 
order
 
process
 
is
 
used
 
to
 
ensure
 
efficient
 
service
 
and
 
highest
 
priority
 
to
 
emergency
 
repairs.
 
Although
 
CDS
 
is
 
not
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
Williams
 
review,
 
the
 
results
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
recent
 
school
 
facilities
 
inspection
 
at
 
the
 
Elementary/Middle
 
school
 
during
 
the
 
Tulare
 
County
 
Williams
 
Settlement
 
review
 
ranked
 
"GOOD"
 
with
 
over
 
98%
 
compliance.
 
When
 
reviewing
 
the
 
report
 
it
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
note
 
that
 
even
 
the
 
minor
 
cosmetic
 
discrepancies
 
are
 
reported
 
in
 
the
 
inspection
 
process.
 
 
The
 
District
 
participated
 
in
 
the
 
State
 
School
 
Deferred
 
Maintenance
 
Program,
 
until
 
SBX34
 
discontinued
 
the
 
program.
  
The
 
district
 
has
 
elected
 
to
 
retain
 
the
 
designated
 
funds
 
to
 
assist
 
with
 
expenditures
 
for
 
repair
 
or
 
replacement
 
of
 
existing
 
school
 
building
 
components.
 
Typically,
 
this
 
includes
 
roofing,
 
plumbing,
 
heating,
 
electrical
 
systems,
 
interior
 
or
 
exterior
 
painting,
 
repair
 
of
 
concrete,
 
repair
 
of
 
wall
 
and
 
floor
 
systems.
 
For
 
the
 
last
 
several
 
school
 
years,
 
the
 
district
 
did
 
not
 
allocate
 
any
 
additional
 
funds
 
to
 
the
 
deferred
 
maintenance
 
program
 
as
 
the
 
current
 
level
 
is
 
well
 
established.

Safety
 
Plan
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
This
 
Comprehensive
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
for
 
Strathmore
 
Union
 
Elementary
 
School
 
District
 
is
 
written
 
in
 
compliance
 
with
 
California
 
Education
 
Code,
 
Title
 
V
 
Education,
 
and
 
Section
 
560,
 
which
 
requires
 
all
 
public
 
schools
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
written
 
disaster
 
preparedness
 
plan.
 
This
 
plan
 
is
 
reviewed
 
annually,
 
with
 
the
 
current
 
plan
 
approved
 
by
 
the
 
school
 
board
 
on
 
August
 
12,
 
2019.
 
Included
 
in
 
the
 
plan
 
are
 
routine
 
and
 
emergency
 
disaster
 
response
 
procedures.
 
Employees
 
of
 
Strathmore
 
Union
 
Elementary
 
School
 
District
 
become
 
familiar
 
with
 
this
 
plan
 
so
 
that
 
they
 
can
 
carry
 
out
 
their
 
responsibilities
 
in
 
an
 
emergency.
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
routine
 
and
 
emergency
 
disaster
 
procedures,
 
the
 
Comprehensive
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
provides
 
information
 
on
 
other
 
safety
 
related
 
policies
 
and
 
procedures
 
including
 
things
 
like
 
discipline,
 
dress
 
code,
 
and
 
school
 
environment.
 
 
An
 
integral
 
part
 
of
 
this
 
plan
 
is
 
the
 
Classroom
 
Emergency
 
Kit
 
in
 
each
 
classroom
 
and
 
School
 
Crisis
 
Response
 
Bug-Out
 
Bags
 
located
 
in
 
the
 
office
 
of
 
each
 
site.
 
These
 
kits
 
are
 
readily
 
accessible
 
to
 
teachers
 
and
 
staff
 
and
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
should
 
a
 
serious
 
emergency
 
occur.
 
Included
 
in
 
these
 
bags
 
are
 
copies
 
of
 
the
 
Comprehensive
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plan,
 
the
 
Suicide
 
Prevention
 
Plan,
 
and
 
the
 
AED
 
Plan.
 
Also
 
included
 
are
 
emergency
 
supplies
 
appropriate
 
for
 
use
 
by
 
a
 
classroom
 
or
 
school
 
site.
 
These
 
kits
 
are
 
updated
 
annually
 
and
 
as
 
needed
 
throughout
 
the
 
school
 
year.
 
Because
