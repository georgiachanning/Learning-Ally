School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law 
to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to 
prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be con
sistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/s
a/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and comm
unity members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enr
ollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availab
ility), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
January 13, 2020
 
 
Lone Pine Unified School District held a Public Hearing on September 18, 2018, and determined that each school withi
n 
the district had sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the 
settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English Language Learners (ELL), are given their 
own ind
ividual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California 
Department of Education,
 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use 
by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee 
composed of teachers and administrators. All
 
recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district 
office prior to adoption. The table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at 
the school.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most
 
Recent Year)
 
 
Lo
-
Inyo Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. Built in 1933, the school 
is situated on eight acres. The school buildings span 32,067 square feet, consisting of the eight classrooms, five p
ortable 
classrooms, library, two staff rooms, a multi
-
purpose room, and a playground. The facility strongly supports teaching and 
learning through its ample classroom and playground space.
 
 
The chart shows the results of the most recent school facilities i
nspection. While reviewing this report, please note that 
even minor discrepancies are reported in the inspection process. The items noted in the table have been corrected or are 
in the process of remediation.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
Safety concerns are the
 
number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors are 
proactive and conduct inspections at school sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely
 
manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that 
emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. The sch
ool is cleaned daily and 
deep cleaning is done when school is not in session. A summary of these standards is available at the school office or at 
the district office. The administration team works with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean 
and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The District still contributes funds for major repairs or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this
 
includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical sys
tems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Lo
-
Inyo Elementary School. Many people visit the campus to 
volunteer in the classroom and participate in school events. Parents and 
visitors are welcomed and required to check in 

departure.  All volunteers are required to get a background check/finger printing befor
e volunteering at the school. During 
lunch, recesses, and before and after school, assigned staff supervise students and school grounds, including the cafeteria 
and playgrounds, to ensure a safe and orderly environment.
 
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan 
was developed by the district to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The 
plan provides students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes the 
following requirements of SB 187 within their safe sch
ool plans: current status of school crime; child abuse reporting 
procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsion; notification to 
teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a school
-
wide dress code
; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and 
school employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures. Fire drills are conducted on a 
monthly basis with earthquake drills being held two times throughout the school year. L
o
-
Inyo Elementary School 
conducts a Lock
-
Down Drill on a quarterly basis throughout the school year.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and updates it as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School 
Plan, are reviewed with school a
nd district staff in the fall, at the start of each school year.
 
 
The plan was last updated and reviewed with school staff in the January of 2020. An updated copy of the plan is available 
to the public at the school office.
