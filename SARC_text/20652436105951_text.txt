About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
dist
rict office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instruct
ional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Madera Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018, and determined that each school within the district had sufficien
t and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to t
he settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Tex
tbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the state are reviewed by a
ll teacher
s and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. The table displays information col
lected in October, 2019 about the quality, 
currency, and availability of the standards

aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Berenda Elementary was originally constructed
 
in 1985 and is comprised of 31 K
-
6 general education classrooms, 1 Special Education classroom, 1 SDC 
Preschool classroom, 1 Literacy Lab, 1 STEAM room, 1 Multipurpose room/Cafeteria, 1 Library, 1 Music room, 3 Madera County Of
fice of Education 
classrooms
, and 2 playgrounds. All classrooms are in good repair. Playground space is adequate for the number of students who attend at
 
any given time. 
There is adequate space for staff to work. Our school grounds are clean and safe thanks to the efforts of many peo
ple.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
The principal works daily with the custodial staff of 3 full
-
time employees to ensure that the school is maintained to provide for a clean and safe school. 
They work a staggered shift schedule with one of them available on campus fro
m 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. A two
-
person team from the district maintenance 
department services the larger maintenance needs. The district makes a great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, saf
e, and functional. To assist 
in this effort, the District uses 
a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of School Construction. The district governing board
 
has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the district off
ice f
or review.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
On a regular basis, classrooms and facilities are inspected by the custodial staff and administration to identify needed clas
sroom repairs. District 
maintenance staff ensures that the repairs are completed in a timely man
ner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest priority 
is given to emergency repairs.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides matching funds on a do
llar

for

dollar basis, to assist school 
districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically this includes r
oofing, plumbing, heating, 
electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor sys
tems. During the summer of the 2019 the cafeteria floor was refurbished and now has a 
polished concrete finish, our parking lot recieved some repairs and the asphal was resurfaced as was the asphalt in the stude
nt playground area. A bicycle 
enclosure was a
lso installed.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the

Parents are an essential component of Berenda 
Elementary School. The Berenda Parent Club (BPC) meets monthly to coordinate fundraising activities to 
support class field trips, school needs, and existing programs. Parents, grandparents, and community members provide meaningf
ul support for our 
students 
and staff. In addition to fundraising, the BPC organizes and facilitates many school events (Harvest Festival, Family Fun Nig
ht, Jog

thon, Used 
Book Sale, etc.) The BPC also supports the efforts of the teachers by providing academic incentives and reward

school governance through their participation on School Site Council (SSC), English Learner Advisory Committe (ELAC), Distric

School Night, Open House, and Parent Conferences. We also host multiple 
Parent Nights 
on various academic themes. The Home/School Compact is an essential component, demonstrating the teamwork between parents, 
students, and staff to the education of our students. Parent volunteers play a crucial role in the leadership of our school. 
Parents 
and other community 
members share their skills and expertise when they volunteer in the classroom, library, and serve as athletic coaches. Parent
s are encouraged and 
welcomed to work in classrooms, attend assemblies, chaperone field trips, and work on scho
ol committees. Come into the office and we can provide you 
with information regarding what paperwork needs to be completed to be a volunteer and/or chaperone.
