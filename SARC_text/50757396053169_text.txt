MISSION
 
 
We at Cunningham Elementary School will empower ALL students to reach their full potential and 
become lifelong learners. 
 
 
OBJECTIVES
 

 
Each student, with the support of parents, families, and educators, will achieve 
academic proficiency at or above 
grade level.
 

 
Every student will exhibit the ability to appreciate diversity by embracing the 
acceptance of others.
 

 
All students will set and achieve challenging goals that lead toward future opportunities 
and success in their education and careers.
 
 
TACTICS
 
 
We will:
 
 
1.
 
develop a system of communication to ensure all students, educators, and families 
receive important information, materials and instruction.
 
 
2.
 
establish a formalized process that provides effective data analysis to guide instruction 
and mee
t individualized learning needs.
 
 
3.
 
implement character education to enhance values that promote a healthy school 
climate.
 
 
4.
 
implement a school wide process for students to set individual goals.
 
 
The Cunningham faculty and staff embrace the district ini
tiatives which include a strong focus on 
student achievement, college and career education, character development, and technology
-
embedded instruction within a safe and secure learning environment. Beginning with the 2017 
school year, Cunningham has initia
ted a school wide focus of Agriculture Science. Students will be 
actively involved in learning about the science and careers associated with our agriculture 
community. Field trips, guest speakers and hands on learning will be occurring throughout the year.

About the SARC
 
By
 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control
 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
s
tate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Cunningham not only provides enrichment opportunities for all students, but each 
grade level also offers both an intervention block and English Language 
Development groups  to ensure students receive instructional support according to their needs.  With the assistance of parapr
ofessionals, teachers are 
able to meet with small groups of
 
students in order to implement intense intervention strategies.  Cunningham staff and students are also supported by 
two Title I

are struggling in 
such areas of mathematics and language arts. The After School Education and Safety Program (ASES) provides ninety Cunningham 
students with tutoring 
and enrichment opportunities.  Other opportunities that are available to students who are
 
below grade level include frequent use of technology with
