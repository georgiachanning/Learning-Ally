By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Morning Creek was built in 1990 and
 
was renovated during the summer of 2010.
  
As you enter the Morning Creek campus 
you are greeted by bright colors that represent the
 
pillars of good character. These pillars are part of t
he Character Counts 
program which supports a positive school culture.
 
Morning Creek enrollment has declined over the years and currently 
hosts 748 students, which is down from 780 students the previous year. Morning Creek has a beautifully diverse 
populati
on with 19.1% of students enrolled being English learners that speak over 31 different languages.
 
 
Morning Creek Mission:
 
 
At Morning Creek Elementary School, we share a collective responsibility to create the conditions that provide our 
students with 
the skills necessary to prepare them for college, career, and success in a global societ
y.
 
 
 
Our mission serves to focus our day
-
to
-
day work with students and colleagues.
 
Morning Creek Elementary is a proud member of the 
No Excuses University network of sc
hools. As a member of the NEU network, we focus our work around the six exceptional systems; 
Culture of Universal Achievement, Collaboration, Standards Alignment, Assessment, Data Management, and Interventions. Using 
these systems, we analyze and design st
udent pathways based on need. We are focused on college and career readiness for all 
students to
 
ensure our students are prepared with a strong educational foundation for their future.
 
 
Each classroom at Morning 
Creek
 
has adopted a college and during our b
i
-
monthly Friday Flag assemblies,each class proudly represents their college by wearing 
their t
-
shirts and calling out their college cheers. This symbolic college
-
readiness focus is followed by rigorous and engaging classroom 
learning.
 
 
Student goal settin
g is a core value at Morning Creek.
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Each day, we recite a positive affirmation through our morning announcements known as the Morning Creek Pledge:
 
 
Today is a new day.
 
 
 
I will improve myself.
 
 
 
There are no limits to my personal success.
 
 
 
I will.
 
 
I can. I must.
 
 
 
No Excuses!
 
 
 
 
 
It is the collective goal of each staff member to instill positive self
-
esteem and perseverance within each child.
 
 
We also have students 
in grades 3rd
-
5th set persona
l academic goals for their learning. Students review their progress with their teacher and set academic 
goals in English language arts and math. Finally, they develop a plan to achieve the goal.
 
 
Each trimester, Goals Assemblies are held to 
celebrate stude
nts' achievement.
 
 
Goal setting helps students take responsibility for their learning and helps them see the relationship 
between effort and achievement. Also, Morning Creek promotes positive character traits through the Character Counts program. 
The 
chara
cter pillars; respect, responsibility, trustworthiness, caring, fairness, and citizenship are also celebrated at our awards a
ssemblies.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Poway 
Unified School District ensures that students attend clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each of its 
schools is maintained in good repair.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained
.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and well maintained.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A night custodial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms and offices daily.  
The district has adopted cleaning standards for all sch
ools.  A summary of these standards is available at the district offices.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.

Research supports the positive effects professional development has on increasing student learning. All teaching staff is 
afforded the opportunity to participate in district and site sponsored professional development.  These workshops are 
presented in a s
emester or year
-
long series and support a wide variety of professional development. These include the 
use of effective instructional strategies, implementing the use of computer technology in teaching and learning, critical 
reading, writing and mathematics
 
strategies, effective use of assessments, positive discipline in
-
services, and multicultural 
training. Teachers and administrators are actively involved in professional development activities at the school, district, 
state, and national level.  The Poway 
Professional Assistance Program (PPAP) provides support for new teachers.
 
 
 
 
At Morning Creek, our professional learning focus is centered around our "Theory of Action," If we communicate a clear 
purpose for learning to students, then students will be able
 
to apply their understanding to relevant tasks which have real 
world applications." Morning Creek teachers are participating in "learning walks with the Theory of action in mind. 
Morning creek teachers are also in deep discussions around the work of Karin
 
Hess Ed.D.as it pertains to DOK levels and 
corresponding tasks.
 
 
 
We continue to implement and study Benchmark" in grades K
-

CORE assessments and revising our intervention programs to better meet the needs of our learner
s.
 
 
Grades 3

to
 
 
focus on strategies to improve mathematical performance. We will continue to analyze or teaching practices
 
 
by 
implementing Lesson Studies that focus on science. This work will focus on the rigor of tasks presented to students, 
as 
well as the Depth of Knowledge of the questions, and student engagement with the lesson presented.
 
 
Morning Creek 
continues to utilize a "push in" model of intervention for some of our students. We continue to study and enhance and 
hone our RTI model an
d S3 process,as we provide a strong technology training and support program for our teachers. This 
year we are also partnering with other school sites such as Shoal Creek to provide "Learning Walks" for our teaching staff. 
We meet as a PLC monthly in addit
ion to monthly staff meetings. The principal works with the district office to provide 
informational training that may take place during ur PLC time, or during our X
