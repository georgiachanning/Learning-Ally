By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Authentic and Powerful 
Accountability
 
Students, parents and staff use a broad range of approaches to measure academic and personal growth. The most 
important and valuable assessment is consistent conversation. This is the norm in all NWP classes. Conversation, 
facilitation, and 
mediation regarding student work and overall process occurs one

one, with small groups, and through 
seminars. Both students and teachers routinely examine progress and proficiency using systematic inquiry and reflection. 
Students employ personal web por
tals to compile and share digital portfolios, collaborate with peers on project 
benchmarks, post blogs, video conference, archive work, and post work for peer and teacher evaluation. All students 
participate in culminating Academic Exhibitions where they a
re evaluated by members of the entire school community. 
Prior to graduation each student must formally present and defend a multimedia portfolio of work and experiences that

Real World Immersion
 
Though Northwest Prep is a small educational enclave, it 
is not an island. Students and staff work to regularly find 
opportunities for students to interact with other students, and successful adults, in the community and beyond. Northwest 
Prep encourages and accommodates students to take classes at Santa Rosa Ju
nior College, and Sonoma State University, 

students are required to interact with experts in the fields that they are exploring, and wi
th professional mentors with 
whom they are communicating, job shadowing, or interning with in the Crossroads program. Students are also required 
to communicate through email or video
-
conferencing with students from other communities and even countries in o
rder 
to gain diverse perspectives on project topics and issues.

year college and career exploration, job shadows, and 
professional internships. All students are also taught professional public speakin
g and communication skills on an ongoing 
basis. The main goal of the program is to, over time, create individualized pathways for each NWP student. When students 
leave Northwest Prep, they leave with an informed plan for their future. Grades 7 and 8 focus 
on exploring their interests, 
abilities, and talents. Grades 9 and 10 focus on exploration of the vast range of careers and different types of colleges and
 
training programs that prepare students for them. Grades 11 and 12 learn how to identify and secure 
professional 
internships and develop a plan to actively contribute in their placement. NWP links students to all levels and fields of the 
professional workplace. We provide students with the opportunity to apply the many practical benefits from their PBL 
e
xperience, to provide a service to their mentors and their organizations, and to further develop their professional and 
academic skills. The Crossroads experience empowers student's ability to make informed choices for life after high school.

curricular goals, and the basis for assessment of each student's progress and growth. When students leave Northwest 
Prep for targeted post
-
secondary 
experiences, they leave proficient in all of the Leadership Skills. We know from our 
graduates that students who are truly proficient in these skills, will be successful no matter what path they choose after 
high school.
 
 
Personal Integrity 
 
Students handl
e themselves with confidence and act with honesty and courage. They commit to their developing beliefs 
and are willing to assume roles as inquiring observers, active participants, and dynamic leaders. They demonstrate positive 
working relationships across 
diverse groups, accept personal responsibility for their actions, and remain open to learning 
from the feedback and guidance of others. 
 
 
Productive Collaboration 
 
Students develop and use the skills necessary to plan and engage in group projects. They wor
k to resolve social and 
logistical conflicts and devise solutions to meet diverse needs. They collectively set goals and develop strategies to meet 
those goals. They evaluate the effectiveness of their approach and constructively adapt to new understanding
s as they 
arise. 
 
 
Critical and Creative Thinking 
 
Students identify problems and pursue opportunities from multiple perspectives. They locate, organize, analyze, and apply 
key information in inventive and imaginative ways. They design, evaluate, and emplo
y a variety of strategies, tools, and 
skills to achieve innovative results. Students are independent, creative, and critical thinkers who question and connect to 
the world around them from both big picture and focused perspectives. 
 
 
Effective Communicatio
n 
 
Students understand and practice effective communication using verbal and nonverbal language with intent, awareness, 
and accuracy. They are empathetic, emotionally intelligent, persuasive, and articulate. They are skillful self
-
advocates who 
effectively
 
communicate their needs. Students internalize and present their understandings and ideas with confidence 
and clarity. Employing a variety of media, they use practical, academic, and artistic abilities to convey meaning in a clear 
and engaging fashion.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The NorthWest Prep campus is safe, clean and more than adequate. The garden is expansive and integral to the overall 
appearance. The shared facilities 
with the County Office of Education, Village Charter School, Redwood Valley Consortium, 
and the YMCA preschool is seamless. The site is well landscaped and maintained. The recent conversion to solar has 
enhanced the facility  by providing energy and covere
d areas for the students.
 
 
The site is in the process of a facilities assessment and will be completed early 2020.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There are a variety of ways
 
for parents to become a very important part of the school community.
 
 
Parents can select from activities that occur during the school day, after school hours and on the weekends. The school 
depends on input from parents as members of the School Leadership
 
Team and the Northwest Prep Parent
-
Student
-
Teacher  Organization (PTSO).   The Leadership Team and the PTSO includes parent and student membership.  These group 
meet monthly and serve in an advisory capacity to the Principal and staff in matters related t
o curriculum and school 
policies. The Leadership Team and PTSO includes parent members who focus their input in areas including career 
exploration and Internship development, fundraising, parent volunteers, public relations, and school events as well as 
pr
oviding input and review of NWP's Charter, safety plan, and WASC plan.  Additionally, parents work with students and 
teachers in by volunteering in classrooms, chaperoning field trips and extra curricular activities, coaching, and participati
ng 
in campus w
orkdays.  To make this happen :
 
 
Parents need access to up
-
to
-
date information on school events, student learning activities, and a clear understanding of 
instructional goals to support their child's education.
 
 
Parents need to feel a sense of connection a
nd engagement with the school community.
 
 
Parents can answer annual questionnaires sent home in summer packet for parents to fill out, informing the school of 
what skills they would like to share with students, ability to participate in school events, driv
e for field trips, or provide job 
shadowing or internship opportunities for students.
 
 
Parents also take part in the Healthy Kids survey and the MyVoice survey helping give feedback on academic and 
community issues.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
A comprehensive safety plan is in place.  The plan includes elements 
that address general procedures and emergency 
situations.  It assures the safety of students and staff in case of any routine or disaster emergency situation.  It includes
 
a 
communication plan with the district office and other district schools.
 
 
Northwest
 
Prep staff and community value a school where students learn in an environment that is safe, supportive, and 
free from outside interference and harm.  We emphasize the development of safety, respect, responsibility and 
communication.  The school community
 
models and reinforces positive and courteous behavior.
 
 
The following are strategies used to support this goal:
 
 
Development of school wide rules and expectations/consequences
 
School wide participation in community building activities during the school ye
ar of to help familiarize students with 
expectations and procedures, and to get to know members of the school community
 
Class Advisories where classroom meetings are held
 
Training and support of playground supervisors
 
 
Disciplinary issues are handled by th
e classroom teachers and referred to the Principal as needed by a referral process.  
Board Policies and Education Code provide the framework for school wide policies. The staff works collaboratively to 
provide interventions which support positive student b
ehaviors.  Regular communication with parents provides for 
ongoing updates regarding students that need monitoring and support.
