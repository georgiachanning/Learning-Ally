Principal's Message
 
 
Welcome to Neil Armstrong School!
 
 
As principal, I have 
the unique privilege of introducing you to the Annual School Accountability 
Report Card for the Neil Armstrong School located in San Ramon California. We are one of twenty
-
two elementary schools in the San Ramon Unified School District. In accordance with 
Proposition 
98, every school in California is required to issue an annual report to the community. We are 
pleased to take this opportunity to inform you about our school programs, our vision and goals, 
and the progress we are making toward attaining that v
ision. Our school has a long
-
standing 
tradition for excellence. Neil Armstrong follows our district Framework for Excellence focusing on 
rigor, relationships and relevance in everything we do. We concentrate on promoting maximum 
academic achievement for ea
ch and every child while focusing on the social and emotional growth 

innovative, balanced, and challenging curriculum. Our strong academic curriculum is embedd
ed in 
the California Standards and our teaching strategies provide a balance of skills and knowledge that 
prepare our children for their future lives. We take pride in its fine reputation for providing a 
positive, caring, and stimulating setting where stud
ents love to learn. The dedicated staff 
recognizes that parents are partners in our most important goal of preparing our children for their 
promising future.
 
 
We have active PTA and Academic Booster associations that we encourage all parents to participate
 
in.  Through cooperation, collaboration, and active involvement of teachers, support staff, and 
parents we are building a foundational base of an exceptional learning environment for our 
children. Our high expectations and encouragement for responsible ci

values are significant at the Neil Armstrong School. Children, staff, and parents consistently model 
positive successes as they work together in our excellent learning community. Teachers, staff 
members, and parents state that child

information users and twenty first century learners. Technology is integrated into the educational 
progr
am as we provide a balanced, quality education to all our students while working toward the 
Standards as measured by CAASPP.  We are placing an increased focus on hands on learning 
through the implementation of a Maker's Space where students are tasked wit
h the mission of 
solving design challenge prompts. We welcome your inquiries or if you would like to speak to me 
directly, please call our office for an appointment. We look forward to addressing any concerns, 
questions, or needs you may have concerning th

School Profile
 
Neil Armstrong School was opened in the fall of 1969 and was named in honor of the astronaut, Neil Armstrong, the first man t
o walk on 
the moon. The school currently ho
uses 548 students in grades kindergarten through fifth grade.
 
 
Our school was honored as a California Distinguished School in 2014, a Blue Ribbon School in 2015, a Gold Ribbon School in 20
16 and a 
Title I Academic Achievement School in 2106 all for academic
 
excellence. These four honors were an outcome of our entire school 
community coming together to create successful programs and services that promote student achievement and the creation of a s
afe and 
supportive environment in which to learn.
 
 
The school ha
d a multi
-
purpose room added to the campus in 2000. The multi
-
purpose room provides space for a music classroom, P.E. 
office, and kitchen. Our MPR  makes it possible for the school to hold assemblies, school events and theater presentations.
 
 
Our school inc
ludes a Maker's Space Hands
-
on Learning Lab, Science lab, and self
-
contained library. Neil Armstrong School has self
-
contained classrooms with inside hallways for easy access. There is a Academic Learning Lab housing the school psychologist, 
speech 
therapi
st and resource specialist who coordinate the special education program. As a staff we work toward the inclusion of all stude
nts 
in our programs. The reading room houses our LLI Reading Program used by instructional assistants and teachers in our Respons
e 
to 
Intervention Program, (RtI).  We were able to add our STEAM lab and Makers Space area thanks to the generous donations made f
rom 
our parents and the hard work of our Boosters. We believe in a positive approach in all areas concerning our students includ
ing Culturally 
Responsive Teaching (CLR) and positive discipline. We support all areas of the curriculum and support in Science, Technology,
 
Engineering, 
Arts and Math, (STEAM), in school wide curriculum and activities.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The capacity of Neil Armstrong school is 654 students in 26 self
-
contained classrooms. The school has a new wing of 6 classrooms and a multi
-
purpose 
room added to the campus in 
2000. The multi
-
purpose room provides space for a music classroom, a P.E. office, a kitchen and makes it possible for the 
school to hold assemblies, school events and theater presentations.
 
 
The school began modernization in the fall of 2003 and was comple
ted for the 2005
-
2006 school year. The school includes a Maker's Space lab, a science 
lab, and a self
-
contained library. Our school has self
-
contained classrooms with inside hallways for easy access.
 
 
There is a special education complex which houses the s
chool psychologist, speech therapist and the resource specialist who will coordinate the learning 
lab program. The reading room will house the reading specialist. The modernization was made possible as a result of the passa
ge of Measure A. Armstrong 
looks 
like a brand new school thanks to the generosity of this community and the new modernization of this building project.
 
 
The entire D Wing received a complete restoration in the classrooms in 2007 due to an accident. Therefore, all of the physica
l structure
s are new to the 
existing building.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district make
s to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents are active partners in the education of their children through involvement in PTA, School Site Cou
ncil, Academic Boosters, the GATE Advisory 

demic success.
 
 
Parent volunteers support many important services to students such as vo
lunteering in classrooms to tutor students or to prepare instructional materials 
for student use. Parents also volunteer to work on special activities such as health screenings, picture day, and academic bo
oster (NAAB) Fundraising 
Events. Our school and st
udents greatly benefit from the energy and commitment of our parent volunteers.
 
 
In addition, Neil Armstrong has numerous partnerships with major corporations that support the school with funding and other 
resources. We are 
indebted to organizations such a
s The San Ramon Valley Education Foundation, the San Ramon Rotary Club, Donors Choose, the Sunset Development 
Corporation, the San Ramon Police Department, San Ramon Fire Department as well as other individuals from the private busines
s sector who contribu
te 
to our school through various means including the matching grants program. Academic excellence can only be achieved when the 
entire community

The San Ramon Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a comprehensive, inclusive model of professional development 
for all staff. Our high 
quality professional 
development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy and instructional strategie
s. 
In 2012
-
13, we established district
-
wide K
-
12 Task Forces in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along w
ith targeted professional 
development offerings. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and t
he Silicon Valley Math 
Initiative. Both organizations are highly respected and have strong ties to the de
velopment and implementation of the CCSS and professional learning 
offerings.
 
These learning experiences are supported with on
-
site coaching provided by a team of instructional coaches who work and train together. The coaches 
received certification as Comm
on Core trainers through the Leadership and Learning Center. They provide one
-
to
-
one coaching, team and grade level 
coaching, whole school professional development, in addition to targeted cross
-
grade level, cross
-
discipline professional development sessio
ns. These 
trainings connect to every aspect of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
formative assessment for 
learning, and lesson design.
 
 
In addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to pa
rticipate in a coach
-
led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting. 
These cohorts are both semester
-
long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for 
Innovators to Proble
m Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously.
 
 
We ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project (formerly known as BTSA). Our s
ummer intensive 
trainings along with on
-
going staff deve
lopment days and release day trainings deeply align with the needs of our individual schools and our Framework 
for Excellence: Supporting Students and their Learning; Supporting Staff and their Work.

Under the leadership and guidance of site administrators
, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to deepen their content 
knowledge, strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of respo
nsibility. As a result, every 
staff member
 
helps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the district as a whole is enhan
ced.
