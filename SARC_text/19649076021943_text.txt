By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic
al education sequences or programs 
of study.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priori
ty: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are an integral part of Roosevelt Elementary and the decision
-
making processes of our school.  Roosevelt parents 
can become involved in school governance in a variety of ways.  For example, on our School Site Council (SSC), parents 
comprise 1/2 of 
the elected members, and they are responsible for developing, monitoring and revising our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) on an annual basis.  In addition, Roosevelt parents can join one or both of our parent 
advisory committees
--
Title I Site Ad
visory Committee (SAC) and English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
--
both of which 
work to give advice and make recommendations to our SSC; further, the respective Presidents of each of these two 
committees, SAC and ELAC, also serve as parent representati
ves on our district's Local Control Accountability Plan
-
Parent 
Advisory Committee (LCAP
-
PAC).  Roosevelt parents can also become involved by serving as representatives of our school 
on numerous district
-
based committees:  Parent Lead Committee, Child Devel
opment Committee, Nutrition Advisory 
Committee, and African American Parent Advisory Committee.  Another way that Roosevelt parents can become involved 
is by joining our Roosevelt PTSA, a non
-
profit organization that works in collaboration with the school 
to organize and 
coordinate fundraisers and other school events for purposes of supporting our school programs and improving our school 
climate.
 
 
In addition to the above
-
mentioned parent governing structures, there are also informal ways that Roosevelt par
ents can 
get involved in the school.  Roosevelt parents can serve as Parent Volunteers or as Parent Participants to support in the 
classroom, on field trips or during other school
-
based events.  Roosevelt parents can also attend Coffee with the Principal 
m
eetings or participate in a wide variety of trainings that are offered throughout the school year (facilitated by District 
personnel, school staff and various other community partners and consultants).  At Roosevelt Elementary School, we 
believe that paren
tal involvement is an essential component in the education and success of our students.

department colleagues to enhance instruction and assessment.   These focus areas are in direct alignment with federal, 
state, and district student achievement academic goals. In ad

sites use their weekly late start Friday sessions, 2 additional hours per month, and 4 additional hours per year (once per 
semester), to analyze student achievement data in a collegial forum. They 
then design effective instructional interventions 


 

School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA).
 
 
District and site professional development also includes trainings around 21st Century Teaching and Learning which 
include the California State Standards and the P21 Framework. Training
 
outcomes are to build the capacity of site and

as the need for a paradigm shift in teaching and learning, the essential components of
 
the P21 Framework, California State 
Standards, English Learner standards and framework, equity and culturally responsive instruction, social and emotional 
learning, and integrating the use of technology to enhance/support instruction and learning. Perform
