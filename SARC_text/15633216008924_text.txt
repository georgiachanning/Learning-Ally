By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Frank West School is one of 43 schools in the Bakersfield City School District. Built in 1958, Frank West is located in a 
south
-
central neighborhood that 
is over 60 years old and provides transportation to over 300 students in grades 
Kindergarten through 5th. We have approximately 799 students. An elementary instructional program in traditional, 
English immersion, and Special Education classes services our 
students. Frank West School has a full
-
time Principal, Vice 
Principal, two Academic Coaches, a full time Intervention Specialist, a Behavior Intervention Specialist, a Family and 
Community Engagement Specialist (FACE), 9 Special Education teachers, and 32 
full
-
time credentialed teachers who teach 
in self
-
contained classrooms. All K
-
3 classes average 21.5 students, with 5 kindergarten classes providing an extended day 
schedule.  Frank West has a fully operational library. In the afternoon, students can exten
d their learning day in the 
Afterschool Education and Safety Program (ASESP) which is a partnership between the Boy's and Girl's club of America 
and BCSD. The ASESP meets the needs of over 100 students by offering activities with a STEAM focus.  Our STEAM 
focus 
is technology with an emphasis on coding (e.g. Ozobots). Homework assistance, art, science, and physical exercise through 
games and team sports are also incorporated into the program.
 
 
Frank West continues to educate our students so that they can ach
ieve academic success now and in the future. Many 
subgroups showed continued growth, especially our English Learners. We will continue to implement strategies that will 
help all students meet their annual EL goals to prepare them for English language profi
ciency. We also have an active and 
growing African American Parent Advisory Committee (AAPAC) focused on building and strengthening relationships 
between our staff and black community leading to continued academic growth and overall achievement of our blac
k 
students.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State prior
ity: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Frank West School 
directly benefits from the active commitment of our parents and community members. The school 
community is involved in school activities that promote student achievement and open communication between the 
school and home. Parent and Community involvement i
s needed to meet the diverse needs of our student population. 

-

with our teachers, students, and staff to help improve student achievement 
and attendance.  Through monthly 
newsletters, home call system,  school marquee,  school website, and teacher newsletters, we keep our families and 
community informed about upcoming events and invite them to discuss strategies or ideas to increase student 
achievement. We have a Community Relations Liaison who assists families with  food, clothing, job training, education, 
health care, shelter, and parenting classes. We also open our school for CBET classes, which are classes that teach parents 
and community
 
members the English language.
 
 
Parent involvement is evident in the classroom,  office, and playground. It is evident by participation in formal committees 
as well as support and time given to school programs and activities. Parents are invited to join co
mmittees such as School 
Site Council (SSC), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), District English Language Advisory Committee (DELAC), 
District Advisory Committee (DAC), District African American Parent Advisory Committee (DAAPAC), and the Booster C
lub.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Professional development is designed to provide 
continuous learning opportunities for administrators, teachers, and 
classified personnel. Training opportunities affirm the basic philosophy of education that learning is a lifelong process tha
t 
contributes to the well
-
being of the students, teachers, admi
nistrators, and community. Professional Development is an 
essential component of effective instruction and student learning.
 
 
All training revolves around identified needs of students and adults for the purpose of the improvement of instruction and 
increas
ing content knowledge. Central to all training are student achievement data, district focus areas, the Common Core 
State Standards, the state adopted standards
-
based instructional materials, and strategies to effectively teach the 
academic content standard
s to all students.
 
 
We also provided extensive professional development for Professional Learning Communities through our Service Delivery 
Model. On
-
site coaching and support is provided by academic coaches and district specialists for reading/language art
s, 
mathematics, science, writing and social emotional learning. The district provides time and resources for collaboration, 
planning, and professional development. Additionally, we provided professional development on Multi
-
Tiered Systems of 
Support and Su
pport to school and district teams.
 
 
Teachers new to the District received four days of professional development prior to the beginning of the school year 
focused on orientation to District and school site policies and services, Common Core State Standards
, classroom 
management, curriculum and pacing, using technology and setting up the classroom. Teachers in their second year with 
the District received two days of professional development prior to the beginning of the school year provided by the school 
sit
e and focused on improving best practices.

New teachers with California preliminary credentials received professional development through the Bakersfield City 
School District (BCSD) Teacher Induction Program (TIP). The focus of BCSD TIP is being mentored 
by an experienced 
teacher, growing in the California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP) and meeting the California Induction 
standards. The culmination of TIP is the recommendation for the CA Clear Credential. Each TIP teacher was assigned a 
vete
ran teacher who served as a mentor. The mentors received on
-
going professional development in 
coaching/mentoring strategies, instructional strategies, and guiding cycles of inquiry. Professional development was 
provided through individual mentoring, monthl
y meetings, and after
-
school workshops.
 
 
Intern teachers received professional development at monthly meetings focusing on the initial teaching skills of the CSTP 
including classroom management, lesson planning, assessment, and establishing a climate that 
is conducive to student 
achievement. Each Intern was assigned a mentor that provided day
-
to
-
day support in these areas as well as advisement 
toward meeting credential requirements. Mentors received monthly professional development in meeting the needs of 
I
ntern teachers. Interns also received coursework and supervision from universities partnered with BCSD to provide the 
Intern Program.
 
 
Teachers on Short Term Staffing Permits (STSPs) were provided mentors and monthly trainings on beginning pedagogy 
and bes
t teaching practices. Each teacher on a STSP designed a plan to meet requirements to move to a CA Intern or 
Preliminary Credential. Support was provided for required testing and BCSD staff worked closely with university partners 
to ensure teachers on permi
ts were taking prerequisite requirements to move to credentials.
 
 
Teachers on Provisional Intern Permits (PIPs) were provided a weekly cohort meeting focused on beginning pedagogy. 
Two cohort meetings occurred weekly to allow teachers on a PIP to work arou
nd university course schedules. Support was 
provided for required testing and BCSD staff worked closely with university partners to ensure teachers on permits were 
taking prerequisite requirements to move to credentials.
