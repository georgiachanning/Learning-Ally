By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career

Parent involvement is critical 
to the mission of Portola Springs; it supports the staff and helps reinforce the importance of 
education to your child. There are many ways to get involved. Following are details of organizations available for parent 
volunteers. Parent
-
Teacher Association 
(PTA) Portola Springs is fortunate to have the support of an active group of parents 
who devote their time and talents to promote activities and events for our students. Our PTA assists in community 
building, planning, and providing financial support, not 
available by other means, which improves the quality of learning 
and increases opportunities for enrichment for all students. Parents are encouraged to attend meetings, support activities, 
and volunteer. Dates and times of meetings and activities will be p
osted on the PTA link of the Portola Springs website 
and on the Portola Springs PTA Facebook page. School Site Council (SSC) The School Site Council is a group of parents and 
school personnel whose responsibility is to plan, monitor, and evaluate our Schoo
l Improvement Plan. Parent members 
are elected by vote of all parents in the fall. Meetings are open to the general parent community and the schedule of 
times will be listed on the Portola Springs Website and in the Grizzly Bizz Newsletter. English Languag
e Advisory Committee 
(ELAC) The ELAC is composed of the principal, staff, and parents of English Language Learners who meet to review our 
instructional support of English Language Learner students. Sometimes this committee is combined with the SSC.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Portola Springs Comprehensive Safety Plan was revised and reviewed in September 2019. It was 
reviewed with PTA, Staff, 
and School Site Council. The three main safety goals are as follows:
 
Goal #1
-
 
Personnel Training and Prep for a Disaster
-
 
This will include training new staff on roles and duties in the event of 
a disaster. Training to be complete
d with district personnel along with IPD.
 
Goal #2
-
 
Facility Awareness
-
 
This will include a staff basic understanding the safety features of this facility (such as key 
cards, locking doors, access systems, parking lot dynamics, etc). This will be accomplish
ed with training and on
-
going 
reflection of procedures.
 
Goal #3
-
 
Community Awareness and Collaboration
-
 
This will encourage staff and students to work with the community to 
understand the dynamics of the community safety issues (such as wildlife and traffi
c) to educate all staff and students on 
response to such events.

Along with the safety components, Portola Springs also continues to implement both Positive Behavior Interventions and 
Supports (PBIS) and Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) to ensure so
cial
-
emotional safety of all students as well as 
academic and behavioral success and safety. Portola Springs G.R.E.A.T. (our school wide PBIS slogan) is a school
-
wide 
commitment to positive behavior support. Identifying, teaching, and reinforcing the expec
ted behaviors allow students to 

of Positive Behavior Interventions and Support (P.B.I.S.). Portola Springs  Elementary staff has under
gone extensive 
training and has experience with the P.B.I.S. philosophies. Our staff adopted the P.B.I.S. philosophy and our first step was 
our behavioral statement of purpose: Portola Springs Elementary is a family of respectful and responsible learners. 
Together with our community we empower our students to be compassionate, empathetic citizens who make a positive 
difference in our world.

place of more than 40 specific funding categories, the new model has established three sources of state funding with 
increased
 
local discretion to determine how best to spend those funds in the service of students.  All districts receive a 
BASE of per
-
student funding that varies slightly depending on grade level.  All districts also receive SUPPLEMENTAL 
funding.  IUSD has used BA
SE and SUPPLEMENTAL funding to support the following programs:
 
 
Site Programs and Services:  1) Support professional learning and teacher coaching through induction program, content 
TOSAs and teacher mentor program , 2) provide summer school and summer ath
letic programs, 3) Allocating site funding 
and staffing to support student achievement through support of Professional Learning Communities (PLC) and site PLC 
coaches, 4) Elementary P.E. paraprofessionals, 5) Support for English language learners, 6) Eleme
ntary science, music, and 
art programs, 7) Purchase textbooks and instructional materials, 8) Develop a technology rich learning environment 
including; Technology matching programs, Technology Maintenance fund and site technology support staff, 9) Maintain
 
previously implemented class
-
size reduction, 10) Additional secondary sections to reduce class size, 11) Middle school 
zero period program, 12) Maintain positive behavioral intervention and support program, 13) Maintain site staffing with 
full

Develop mental health and wellness programs and hire district and site based staff including support for the Irvine Family 
Resource Center.
 
 
Finally, CONCENTRATION grant f
unding equal to 50 percent of the base is provided to districts in which English
-
learners, 
low
-
income students and foster youth exceed 55 percent of the total enrollment.  Irvine Unified School District is not 
eligible for concentration funding because its
 
enrollment does not exceed the 55 percent threshold.
