About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abo
ut the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal
 
or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, A
vailability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Monterey Peninsula Unified School District held a public hearing on August 2019, and determined that the school had sufficien
t and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials
, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given 
their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to
 
take home. Textbooks 
and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making the 
textbooks used in the 
school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed
 
by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School 
Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent ex
amination at the district 
office prior to adoption. The table displays 
information collected in August 2018 about the quality, currency, and availability of the California Common 
Core standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
In 2010, the Monterey Peninsula Unified Schoo
l District overwhelmingly approved Measure P, a $110 million locally
-
controlled school bond measure to 
fund the first phase of critical repairs and improvement to our local schools. The district's newest school was built in 1965
, more than 50 years ago, an
d 
our Facilities Needs Assessment has identified over $680 million in critical repairs to all MPUSD schools. Recently, in 2018,
 
voters approved Measure I, a 
$213 million school facilities bond by 70%.
 
 
Many school bond projects are underway. Visit www.mpus
d.net and search for Measure I & P Dollars at Work for additional details.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the
 
Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an
 
assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical systems, heating and ventila
tion 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good
 
repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for
 
this assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about 
by the Williams legislation. You can look at the six

page Facilities Inspection 
Tool used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC.

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eli
gible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school 
district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents and the community members are very supportive of the educational programs at Del Rey 
Woods Elementary School. Staff members and parents 
participate on various committees that make decisions regarding the priorities and direction of the school to ensure instruct
ional programs and activities 
address various student needs. Parents are encoura
ged to participate on one or more of the following committees or organizations: 
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English
-
Language Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC)
 

 
Parent
-
Teacher Association (PTA)
 

 
School 
Volunteer Program
 
In addition to the above formal organizations, there are opportunities for parent education throughout the year. They are inv
ited to attend Abriendo 
Puertas and Parenting Partners. 
 
 
The SSC is a group of teachers, parents, and classified
 
employees that works with the principal to review and update the 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement (SPSA) including proposed expenditure of funds allocated to the school. The English Learner Advisory Committee (E
LAC) is responsible for 
advising the prin
cipal and the staff on programs and services for the English learners and the School Site Council (SSC) on the development of
 
the 
School 
Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA). The District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC) meets at least four times 
a year. Through DELAC, parents 
and community members throughout MPUSD gather to provide input and review policies, procedures, and data that impact English 
learners and 
resdesignated students. One time per year, DELAC celebrates Del Rey Woods' scholars who
 
have reached English proficiency and been redesignated as 
English fluent and proficient. The Parent Teacher Association (PTA) is an energetic organization of parents and teachers whos
e function is to promote 
the welfare of students at school and in their 
homes and community. The PTA, which actively sponsors fund
-
raising events, provides outstanding support 
to our students and staff in the form of classroom instructional materials and supplies, facilities and campus improvements, 
staff appreciation, 
assembl
ies, and field trips. Parents, guardians, and community members are also invited to come and participate in our School Volunt
eer program.
