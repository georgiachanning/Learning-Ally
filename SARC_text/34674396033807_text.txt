School Description
 
Our Vision is that Bret Harte is a safe, caring community where the whole child learns, dreams and 
is inspired to succeed!
 
 
Our goal at Bret Harte Elementary School is to maximize the unique potential of each and every 
child in a happy and secure environment.  We believe that our students will be the responsible, 
contributing decision
-
makers of the futu
re who will improve and strengthen.
 
 
Bret Harte Elementary School is a K
-
6 public school with two hundred and fifty
-
nine students. Our 
students reside primarily in the Oak Park and Curtis Park communities. Approximately 82% of our 
students qualify for free
 
or reduced lunch. Approximately 16% of our students are English learners.  
Students at Bret Harte benefit from a number of programs that are designed so that we can attempt 
to meet their individual needs.  These programs include: Student Support Center, E
xtended Day 
Mentoring,  one to one ratio for technology. Our school has implemented iReady Assessments and 
differentiated curriculum to support our goal of small group instruction. We also have a Garden 
Council that focuses on bringing science curriculum t
o the garden and finds outside resources for 
our school garden to meet the Next Generation Science Standards.  Each classroom receives thirty 
minute Mindfullness curriculum that will help students with focus and self regulation. The goal of 
Mindlfulness is
 
to meet Physical Education requirements and reduce behavior referrals and 
suspensions. We have also implemented a time away in each classroom to address students who 
need a quiet space and tools to use in the classroom to address disregulation. Time away 
will 
decrease students leaving the classroom and missing instruction. We adhere to the core curriculum 
for the district, Benchmark Advanced for our English Language Arts program and Envision as our 
math program.  All students grade Kinder
-
6 benefit from ou
r music  programs. This music program 
ranges from teaching students signing, recorders, reading a playing music, ukulele, and keyboard. 
We are proud of our wide range of programs, as we attempt to provide the best education for each 
of our students. Our ad
ditional programs include Reading Partners, school library, Music including 
choir and after school lessons including string instruments, guitar, and choir. Our school also offers 
Target Excellence after school programming. Target Excellence provides colleg
e and career 
readiness. This program offers homework assistance, sports, food literacy, health education, and 
yoga.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abo
ut the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The district instruc
tional material evaluation committee, consisted of members representing teachers, administrators, other staff, students, 
parents/guardians, and community, ensures that the selected textbooks, technology
-
based materials and other educational materials effec
tively support 
the district's adopted courses of study and meet current curricular goals and California Content Standards. Teachers, student
s, parents/guardians and 
community members have the opportunity to review and provide input about the instructional 
materials being considered for adoption. 
Recommendations for the adoption and/or withdrawal of instructional materials by the instructional material evaluation commit
tee are presented to 
the Board by the Superintendent or designee and include documentation
 
supporting the recommendation. In some instances, the considered textbooks 
and/or instructional materials are piloted for a period of time before being recommended for adoption to the Board of Educati
on.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators 
and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including ELA 
Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Ling
uistically Relevant Teaching and Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through this program deeply align with the needs of our ind
ividual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and co
nnect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson design.
 
 
Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outside of contracted hours. In additio
n to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunity for teachers to engage
 
in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening their c
ontent knowledge, strengthening their instructional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of responsibility.
