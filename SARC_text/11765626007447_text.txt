By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

ighly qualified content specialist 
instructors to maximize their learning as they prepare for high school.  This year is the second year implementing our  Dual 
Immersion Program
--
at the Kindergarten, first and second grade levels providing bilingual instru
ction to 70 students.   We 
are pleased to offer middle school athletics: flag football, volleyball, boys and girls basketball. School and student safety
 
are paramount for our students and staff at Hamilton Elementary School. Students are supervised through
out the day. A 
crossing guard is available before and after school and we have yard duty supervisors that assist with campus safety. 
Scheduled drills and training for fire, lock
-
downs, and other emergency situations are conducted monthly to enhance the 
pre
paredness of our staff and students if such an event occurred. Our vision is to create a K
-
8 school that is highly regarded 
for its academic excellence and for its contribution in actively serving and improving the community in which it operates. 
The missi
on of the faculty, staff, and administration of Hamilton Elementary School is to provide a well
-
rounded and 
comprehensive academic program to ensure that all students learn at high levels.
 
 
Hamilton Elementary School is committed to making a positive diffe
rence in the lives our students. We will accomplish 
this by setting high academic expectations for all children and supporting students socio
-

tiered system of supports.   By supporting a positiv
e school culture, setting high standards 
for teacher performance, increasing academic expectations for all students and engaging the community in school
-
wide 
events, it is our goal at Hamilton Elementary School to foster independent life
-
long learners and 
their college and career 
preparedness.  We welcome parents to work in the classroom, to be involved with our Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), 
and to participate in all school activities. We embrace the challenges of the future while we  celebrate the tra
ditions of 
the past. Our staff, parents and students are provided opportunities to create a collaborative culture with respect for 
individual differences and diverse community values.

instructional materials that were approved by the State Board of Education in the core curriculum areas. 
Hamilton 
Elementary School adheres to the State
-
adoption cycle for purchasing textbooks and all materials considered for District 
adoption are available to the public for review prior to any purchase. A public sufficiency and adequacy hearing is held 
each 
year in October by the Glenn County Office of Education. Because we are a small K
-
8 elementary school, we involve 
the entire staff in the selection of textbooks and instructional materials. Whenever feasible, we have piloted the 
curriculum under considerat
ion for a semester (from the state
-
approved list), conducted an evaluation of the material 
based on predetermined guidelines, presented evaluation summaries to the entire staff, and made staff recommendations 
to the school board.
 
 
Hamilton Elementary Schoo
l has transitioned to Common Core Standards and teachers use instructional materials and 
practices to best serve our students. We adopted Everyday Math (K
-
5) and CPM (6

8) and Study Sync for English Language 
Arts. We are currently piloting for science.  Ha
milton Elementary School is in compliance with the curriculum adoption 
cycle established by the California Department of Education. The District has aligned the curriculum with the State 
Frameworks and the Content Standards.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Hamilton Elementary has a closed campus from 8:00 
a.m. until 6:00 p.m. while school and the Boys and Girls Club program 
are in session. Prior to the start of the school day, one of two Maintenance personnel inspects the campus for safety. The 
facility is clean and in good repair. There are ample classroom
s, restrooms, playground space and equipment.
 
 
A staff of two provides janitorial services. Schedules are arranged so that no classrooms are interrupted during 
instructional time. Custodial services are available from 6:00 a.m. until 8:30 p.m. The cafeteri
a is cleaned after both 
breakfast and lunch and restrooms are cleaned and sanitized daily. The school grounds are clean and well ordered. Trash 
cans are available throughout the campus.
 
 
The playgrounds and lawns are mowed weekly. The District contracts wi
th an arborist to annually perform necessary 
routine trimming of trees.
 
 


acilities (such as HVAC, roofs, floor surfaces, and so 
on). All toilets and other fixtures work and are in good repair. We have installed automatic flush valves on every toilet and
 
hand dryers in each restroom to maintain a clean environment for students.
 
 
Hamilton City has maintained an elementary school on this location since the early 1900s. All of the original buildings have 
long ago been replaced by modern facilities. All buildings meet current fire and earthquake codes. An OPSC modernization 
project w
as completed within the past ten years that completely renovated the primary wing containing four classrooms, 
two reading labs, and an adult restroom. Within the last seven years, a new kindergarten complex with three classrooms, 
each containing restrooms,
 
was added to our campus.
 
 
Hamilton Elementary School occupies 4.8 acres with separate athletic fields and blacktop space for both primary and 
middle school students. There are separate playground facilities with rubber drop zones for both primary and midd
le 
school children. The cafeteria complex can also serve as a gymnasium. All buildings have handicap access. The library has 
holdings in both English and Spanish. All students have Internet access through the computer lab. The lab has 30 Dell 
multimedia co
mputers. We are also considering a solar energy project at the Hamilton Elementary.
 
 
The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a 
dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts wi
th expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school 
building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or 
exterior painting, and floor systems. For the 2011
-
12 school year
, the District budgeted $78,800 for the Deferred 
Maintenance Program. This represents .012% of the District's general fund budget.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Hamilton 

Parents can become involved in our school in various ways. Parents are encouraged to be actively involved in our Site and 
District committees.  Commi
ttees such as our District leadership team known as HULC, (Hamilton Unified Leadership 
Committee)  guides curriculum and instruction for all schools in Hamilton Unified. HULC is where all voices can be heard 
and guide the goals and actions of our school bo
ard. Our School Site Council helps school leadership plan for categorical 
funding expenditures as well as help refine the goals and objectives of Hamilton Elementary School. This hour of 
commitment deeply affects how we provide a effective instruction for 
all our students and provide learning opportunities 
to prepare students for college and career. We also have a monthly parent luncheon that invites parents or guardians to 
lunch together, with HES leadership, to be kept informed of schoolwide initiatives a
s well as take part in our ELAC.  Finally, 
the Parent Teacher Organization known to us as PTO. Our PTO parents work tirelessly to provide extra classroom and field 
trip monies for our elementary staff. Since the last recession, schools have been trying to 
rebuild funding we once received 
back in 2008.  Prices or cost of operating schools have gone up while funding has not.  PTO works to fill in this gap and 
needs each parent to actively participate in the PTO membership. We encourage parents and grandparent
s to contact  
classroom teachers.
 
 
Parents are invited each month for morning coffee with the principal to share ideas and voice any concerns as well as 
inform parents of other information about upcoming events. Our family case manager/liaison provides an 
additional 
resource for parent outreach including home visitations and bridging school/home relationships.
 
 
Academic Parent Teacher Teams (APTT) have been established in various classrooms on campus. This is an opportunity 
for parents to meet with their te
acher and discuss their children and school performance in comparison with other 
students. Teachers then create goals with parents and teach parents specific learning activities that support the goals so 
they can better work with their children at home. Af
ter a set amount of time, the teacher reconnects with the parents and 
discusses assessment results on the learning goals that were established. This process repeats itself and parents become 
more connected with their child's learning and progress.

rther information on how parents may become involved in our school, please contact Kathryn Thomas, Principal, at

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Maintaining a safe, orderly environment is essential to learning. This begins with periodic inspections of all facilities as 
well as a written plan.
 
 
A 
comprehensive safety plan that outlines all emergency procedures and processes is maintained in the school office. The 
School Safety Plan was last updated for approval in December of 2018 and  was reviewed with staff and School Site Council. 
As part of the
 
safety plan, a Crisis Response Plan was created and is annually reviewed in conjunction with the Glenn 
County Sheriff and the Hamilton Fire Department.
 
 
Hamilton Elementary School has a closed campus from 8:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. while school is in sessi
on. Prior to the 
start of the school day, one of two maintenance personnel inspects the campus for safety. Teachers, classified staff, and 
administration are assigned supervision duties during all recesses and lunch periods in the cafeteria. Fire drills ar
e 
conducted monthly, and lock
-
down/intruder drills at least twice a year.  As part of the Safety Plan Objectives, staff and 
students receive monthly scenarios and trainings in an effort to develop muscle memory to respond potential incidents. 
Fourteen came
ras are installed to provide 24 hours surveillance of two thirds of our campus. All visitors to the campus 
must check in with the office. Access is limited through two pedestrian gates in front of the school during the beginning 
and end of the school day. 
During the school day access is limited to a single pedestrian gate in the front of the school. 
Student absences are confirmed by a phone call to the parent or guardian and no child is released from school during the 
day without previous approval by parent
s or guardians. Any removal of students during the school day is documented in 
the office and parents are required to report to the office for all inquiries. All classrooms and other student areas are 
equipped with phones capable of reaching 911.
 
 
Keeping 
students in school even when disciplinary matters occur is a priority.  At times, students may be excluded from 
school because of certain violation of the education code section 48900. Usually such actions as fighting, bringing unsafe 
objects, including fi
rearms and knives are usually met with immediate exclusion and may result in an expulsion under 
Education Code Section 48915. At Hamilton Elementary School we work as an administrative team with our Intervention 
Specialist (Counselor) to find alternatives 
to removing students from school. Parents are reminded to have conversations 
with children about school and classroom expectations for schoolwide safety.  Join us as a partner in safety by having 
family talks about how your child can be safe and learn at H
amilton Elementary School.

Professional Development (Most Recent Three Years)
 
 
The Hamilton Unified School District has provided four staff development days and calendared seventeen minimum day 
Fridays to allow for additional hours of staff development.  The focus of  the staff development  has 
included training to 
support our effective Professional Learning Communities, effective instructional practices, and socio
-
emotional learning. 
During the  school year, the professional development at Hamilton Elementary School has been in alignment with ou
r 
MTSS grant, and all staff development during the site's 12 staff training afternoons has been focused on supporting 
academic, behavior, and social
-
emotional instruction and learning as informed by our SWIS behavioral data and progress 
monitoring of stude
nt achievement (Benchmark Assessments). In addition to districtwide and schoolwide professional 
development opportunities, coaching opportunities are made available to support our schoolwide initiatives and meeting 
the needs of our special populations: 1:1
 
coaching, co
-
teaching, content and grade
-
level collaborations and lesson studies 
with our DI program and NTC (New Teacher Center).
 
 
The Hamilton Unified Leadership Team was established to develop an action plan to increase student achievement and 
meet fed
eral guidelines for program improvement schools. This team meets monthly.
