About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is 
required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (
LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported i
n an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa
/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members shoul
d contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Site professional development calendar have been developed to create differentiated professional development based on two col
laborative meetings 
held Spetember 2018 to establish professional development goals 
for the 2018
-
2019 school year at Sierra View. Staff is exposed to three district level 
professional development days at the beginning of the year to address district initiatives, and adopted new programs. Site pr
ofessional development 
plan addresses differ
ent areas of needs based on the teacher stull objectives, which are turned in by all teachers at the beginning of the year.
 
 
SVES uses multiple measures to plan an area of focus for professional learning.This includes, but it not limited to, CAASPP, 
ELPAC,
 
NSGRA (Scholastic Next 
Steps Guided Reading Assessment), DIBELS, and INSPECT. This is used in conjunction with common formative assessments that are
 
administered in the 
classroom. Teachers collaborate over these assessments to identify an area of focus fo
r professional learning. Teachers also participate in a survey that 
is administered at the end of the school year that provides a time of reflection for teachers to express areas of achievement
, as well as areas of need. 
This survey, in conjunction with as
sessment data and stull objectives assists in guiding professional development. SVES has fully implemented the used 
of School City data management system to analyze student benchmark data. The school site utilizes the INSPECT district format
ive assessments
 
to track 

ear to the end of the 
year. Students take the assessment three times a year (1st September, 2nd December, 3rd March). Aft
er the assessments have been given teacher review 
data by utilizing the research based strategy known as Cycle of Inquiry (COI). The benchmarks help the teacher celebrate what
 
went right and what still 
needs to meet proficiency. .
 
 
Professional development
 
is delivered in different forms at SVES, depending upon need. The staff participate in two types of learning, site driven and
 
teacher driven professional development. The SVES staff participates in a site driven professional development based on eithe
r di
strict or site iniatives.

Professional learning for the site is in the form of site based professional learning, book studies, workshops, Cycle of Inqu
iry , and collaboration.  Teacher 
driven professional development is based on teacher need according to t
he survey, stull objectives, and other criteria. Professional learning for teachers 
are in the form of conferences, individual mentoring, and collaboration.
 
 
Common Core instruction has been the main focus of staff collaboration at Sierra View this year an
d SVES uses two informal ways to create greater 
collaboration across grade level. Teachers Observing Teachers (TOT) will be used twice a year to foster greater collaboration
 
between teachers regarding 
new ways to meet the rigor of Common Core. TOT is a pro

they might be able to bring back to their own classroom.  Snapshot of Success is a new initiative that administration has imp
lemented this year where 
administration 
takes pictures of a classroom activities and shares it with the entire learning community. These initiatives serve two purpos
es when 
supporting Common Core lesson design: it celebrates the success of our teachers, and it sustains greater collaboration acro
ss grade levels.  
Implementation of classroom technology has been a site focus for the past few years. Teachers have adopted the initiative to 
be trained in Google 
Classroom for the 2017
-
2018 school year. By the end of the 2017
-
2018 school all teachers at 
Sierra View will have attended at least one Google 
Conference.
 
 
During implementation of professional learning, teachers are supported through peer collaboration,vertical articulation, and 
principal coaching and 
support. Site administration has dedicated 6
 
minimum days on the professional development calendar to support collaboration. These collaboration 


coll
aboration on pacing guides and curriculum, once a month staff meeting that focuses on areas of need as defined by the stull o
bjectives, and staff 
attends local professional learning for specific areas of interest.
