By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Millikin Basics+ School is centrally located in the Santa Clara Unified School District (SCUSD) at 615 Hobart Terrace. This 
became the new location for Millikin Basics+ Elementary School on August 2
012. Millikin School is a K
-
5 alternative school, 
providing a program which stresses the teaching of basic education fundamentals, using established teaching techniques 
in a structured environment. The instructional mode for students is through direct grou
p instruction. Extension and 
remediation activities are provided for students through cooperative parent involvement under teacher direction. The 
school philosophy is committed to major daily emphasis on reading, math, and language arts taught at grade lev
el. 
Instruction is sequenced to progress from basic skills knowledge to content and application. Higher level thinking skills are
 
incorporated into all areas of the curriculum. Teachers are committed to quality time on task, and high expectations are 
refle
cted in daily class and homework assignments. Students adhere to a dress code and follow a specific discipline plan 
with rules, rewards, and consequences. Self
-
esteem of students is high as evidenced by their behavior. Classroom 
interruptions are kept to a
 
minimum in order to support maximum learning time.
 
 
As an alternative program, Millikin does not utilize instructional assistants except to assist special needs students, and 
pullout programs are kept to a minimum. Teachers differentiate instruction in th
e classroom to meet the needs of each 
student. After school clubs such as Math Olympiad and Drama Club also extend and enrich student learning. In accordance 
with district guidelines, state and federal law, the school provides Special Education and English
 
Language Development 
programs.
 
 
Students are tested, enrolled, serviced and exited from these programs according to district, state, and federal criteria. 
Identified students receive assistance as needed each week from a resource specialist, a speech and 
language therapist, 
and counselor.
 
 
Parent visitations are limited to a formal visitation schedule in the month of January. With communication as a central 
focus of the program, student progress is articulated through formal and informal parent conferencin
g via phone, written 
notes or letters, e
-
mail, or person
-
to
-
person on a scheduled basis.
 
 
Millikin Basics+ has consistently ranked at the top of our district elementary schools, among the top 5% of schools in the 
county and top 100 schools in the state. Cu
rrently, Millikin School is ranked in the top 10% of schools in the state of 
California based on STAR test results. Also, recently Millikin School received the prestigious National Blue Ribbon School 
Award for 2012. The program is noted for its excellent p
arent support, consistency, organization, and total staff 
commitment for student achievement, reporting of student progress, and student/parent/staff responsibility. Student 
performance is consistently excellent. Students at Millikin have positive attitude
s, and they enjoy being at school.
 
 
Enrollment in the school is open to all parents in SCUSD wishing to have their children in the program. Classes are designed 
for 24 students in grades K
-
3. There are 30 students enrolled per class in grades 4 
-
 
5. 
Demand for entrance into the school 
is high.
 
 
Millikin serves a wide range of district students and families from all socio
-
economic levels. The school is in a lower
-
to 
middle class residential area. The student population mirrors our district as over 
60% of our students are minority. Single 
parents and families with two working parents are common.

Millikin's staff consists of 22 classroom teachers, a library media assistant, a computer technology assistant, a science lab
 
assistant one
-
two days a week,
 
an on
-
site counselor one day a week, a psychologist one day a week, a speech and language 
therapist one day a week, and a resource specialist for four hours each morning. It is our vision that given appropriate 
instruction and support, our students will b
e committed to learning, achieve at their full potential, attain a positive self 
concept, experience consistent academic success, and be responsible school and community members.
 
 
Millikin's vision was first articulated by the parents and teachers who coll
aboratively defined this alternative school. The 
vision includes clear emphasis on a strong foundation of academic skills and high expectations for all students 
-
 
habits and 
behaviors that will enable them to be successful when they leave Millikin. This vi
sion is based on the premise that all 
students can learn and achieve at grade level. The vision defines school expectations at the highest levels for all members 
of the school community: for student academic effort and progress, behavior, and responsibilit
y; for staff commitment to 
supporting and meeting the needs of all students; for parent support of their child's educational experience. The clarity 
and consistency of this vision is a fundamental strength of the Millikin program. Understanding of and comm
itment to this 
vision are communicated to all parents and teachers as they enter the school community, and they are continually 
reinforced.
 
 
The mission of Millikin Basics+ School is to provide a safe, caring, engaging academic environment in which all stu
dents 
develop the abilities, skills, and confidence to be successful learners and problem solvers. Interaction and shared 
commitment between families and the school have always been a priority at Millikin. Parent involvement is a fundamental 
part of the pr
ogram. Our PTA boasts over 100% membership. This organization plans, implements, and evaluates an 
enormous range of programs and activities for children, families, and staff which provide a sense of family to the school. 
Activities include parent education
, new parent orientation, social functions, fundraising, and volunteer help in the 
computer and science labs and in the library. In line with the District's Master Plan for Parent/School Partnerships, we 
have implemented the Parent/Student/Teacher Agreemen
t Program. An agreement contract is on file for each student 
that guarantees each member's commitment to the child's educational program.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
 
Santa Clara Unified School District (SCUSD) 
takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To 
assist in this effort, SCUSD uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California OPSC. The results of this
 
survey are available by request made to the SCU

-
2061.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and 
Repair
 
SCUSD maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highes
t priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in SCUSD, Board Policy 3514. The policy can be found 
online at www.santaclarausd.org/BoardPolicies. The principal works daily with the custodial s
taff to develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance
 
SCUSD participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program to assist school districts with expenditures for 
major repair or replacement of existing school 
building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
Modernization Projects
 
SCUSD strives to be a model of financial responsibility, making every 
effort to spend taxpayer dollars wisely. At the same 
time, ongoing bond programs are necessary in a district this large, with so many students, teachers, and facilities needs. 
Bond funds allow the District to maintain safe, modern school facilities and bri
ng in updated technology essential to 
student achievement. Measure B 1997 improvements included new elementary school play structures, new high school 
science classrooms and outdoor athletic facilities, the major renovation of eleven elementary schools, an
 
ambitious roof 
replacement program, and two high school performing arts buildings. Measure J 2004 generated funds to modernize 
buildings and classrooms for middle schools, high schools, and the adult education campus. Measure H 2010 upgraded 
fire, safety 
and security systems, renovated and reopened a closed elementary school, installed solar panels to decrease 
energy costs, purchased the Agnews campus property, and expanded overcrowded schools. Measure H 2014 funds 
construction of three new schools on the 
Agnews campus, expands overcrowded schools, and addresses critical facility 
needs such as replacing roofs and adding air conditioning to elementary school classrooms. Measure BB 2018 funds the 
construction of three new schools, reconstructs fields, replace
s aging play structures and playground paving, adds shade 
structures, and upgrades fencing and gates, among many other crucial projects. More: www.santaclarausd.org/bond
 
 
Age of School Buildings
 
Measure J Bond monies funded a total remodeling of the Maripo
sa campus in 2012, which became the new Millikin 
Elementary School campus. Millikin was moved to this new site due to growing enrollment. The latest advances in facility 
design and technology have been incorporated into the new campus. The campus is extrem
ely beautiful and is located in 
a quiet neighborhood. Solar panels provide 80% of the power to the school. A new administration building is currently 
under construction on the new site. It will also be a state
-
of
-
theart facility when completed.

the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State
 
priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Family 
involvement and interaction with the daily activities of the school is a crucial part of the Millikin program. Each 
Millikin family signs a Parent/Student/Teacher Agreement guaranteeing commitment to their child's educational program 
at the beginning of th
e school year. Parents at every grade level are encouraged to read aloud to their children and to 
model independent reading for pleasure. Students are encouraged to take home math games to play with parents in order 
to practice math skills. Families are re
quired to volunteer at least 10 hours per child per year in support of the school 
programs and activities. This level of commitment puts parents and staff in contact on a constant basis.
 
 
In keeping with the Basics+ philosophy, parents do not volunteer in 
the classrooms, but they may volunteer in the library, 
computer lab, and science lab in order to assist students and teachers.
 
 
The Millikin PTA consistently has over 100% participation yearly. Parents and staff members work together to plan and to 
implement extracurricular programs such as choral music, parent education programs, noon sports, Drama Club, Family 
Math Nights, Science Fair, Family BBQ lunches, Talent Show, Harvest Festival, Play Day, Walk
-
a
-
Thon, and more. The PTA 
plans, implements, an
d evaluates a large range of programs that benefit the school and involve family and community 
members.
 
 
Rather than asking students to sell candy, magazines, etc, as annual fundraisers, Millikin asks parents to donate money to 
support the school programs 
and activities. Many parents request matching funds from their employer when they donate 
to the school. Five parents elected by the school community serve on the School Site Council and are important members 
of the school's leadership team. More informatio

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
All California public schools kindergarten and grades one through twelve must develop a comprehensive school safety 
plan, per California Education Code sections 32280
-
32289. School safety plans assess school climate and safety, identifying 
goals and action
s to improve safety and climate. The safety plan is written and developed with collaboration from 
students, parents, community, and law enforcement. It is reviewed and updated annually with the School Site Council 
(SSC).
 
 
We are committed to providing a sa
fe, responsible and respectful school environment for all students, staff, and 
community. We support and promote building a sense of community and belonging where every child feels included and 
valued, teaching children positive social skills and attitudes
 
including resolving conflicts without violence, and preparing 
for and responding appropriately to emergencies and disasters to keep children safe.
 
 
The school safety plan is available for review in the school office and was approved by the School Site Cou
ncil in 2019.

Staff development activities and expenditures are tied to District and school goals including the SPSA, WASC, LCAP, and 
District Strategic Plan. Staff development time continues to support teachers in self
-
reflection, analysis of student 
achievement data, 
and collaboration activities designed to help reach achievement goals. We believe in modeling lifelong 
learning for our students by engaging in collaborative sessions and professional development opportunities that align with 

School Plan
 
for S
tudent Achievement (SPSA) goals and support student achievement in content standards and 
Expected Schoolwide Learning Results (ESLRs). District and school staff development programs support meeting the 
academic, social, and emotional needs of all students 
by providing opportunities for teachers to advance their skills, 
develop teaching strategies, and create curriculum. During staff in
-
service days, teachers share information about 
instructional practices, cognitive development and learning disabilities, an
d best practices for English Language Learners. 
These presentations and workshops help us understand who our students are so we can better support them with 
individual counseling, curriculum design, and instructional practices.
 
 
There are four days dedicat
ed to professional development in the 2019
-
2020 school year. There were five days of 
professional development in the 2018
-
2019 school year, eight days of professional development in the 2017
-
2018 school 
year, and eight days of professional development in t
he 2016
-
2017 school year. In addition, there is professional 
development happening on the school campus through professional learning communities, where teachers meet to 
discuss best practices while assessing student work.
