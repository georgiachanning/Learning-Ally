School Description
 
We 
are excited to share that not only are we one of two Computer Science Magnet Schools in 
Orange County, and all of our students are issued their own iPad to be used at school and at home! 
We have partnered with Code to the Future to provide a Computer Scien
ce Immersion Program. 
Students share solutions featuring computer programming with a real
-
world audience, beyond 
their teacher. With this program, students are able to collaborate with experts in the world as they 
use computer programming to solve problems
. These experiences contribute to student ownership 
of their work, and a deeper learning applied to all content areas.
 
 
Students are engaged in a structured program provided by Code to the Future that provides 
Computer Science lessons and activities 
regularly. These activities include learning programming 
languages and applying what they learned using LEGOs and Minecraft.  As the school year 
progresses, computer science lessons will be woven into other core subject area instructional time. 
Teachers ar
e provided weekly support and coaching from a Code to the Future "Coach" who 
provides instructional resources and lessons to help students solve relevant and authentic 
problems which will be showcased throughout the school year to the community; these show
cases, 
known as "Epic Builds" will occur several times a year.
 
 
We firmly believe that all children have the opportunity to learn in a safe, positive environment 

t, 

STEM lab, which includes ozobots, spheros, cublets, and ozmo, is a place where students interact 
with technology in new and different ways, allowing th
em to engage in collaborative projects, 
thereby ensuring their future success through meaningful and engaging learning activities both 
during the school day and in our after school programs. Our safe and supportive environment 
engenders student confidence 
and competence on the road to college and career readiness.
 
 
As a California Gold Ribbon School and Title I Academic Achievement Award School, amazing things 
happen at El Cerrito. With a continual focus on student learning, all instructional activities are

day 
Kindergarten prepares our youngest Scotties with the foundation needed for future success.
 
 
Teachers meet on a weekly basis in Professional Learning Community gr
oups to collaborate and 
discuss student achievement, possible intervention and enrichment opportunities and how to 
differentiate instruction to meet the needs of all students. Teachers are continuously asking 
themselves four key questions when discussing s
tudent achievement to ensure student success.
 
 

 
What do we expect students to learn?
 

 
How will we know when they have learned it?
 

 

 

 
How will we respond when they already know it?
 
 
The parents and the community are a k

About the SARC
 
By
 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control
 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
s
tate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about t
he school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

the extent that ea
ch pupil has a 
textbook or instructional materials or both to use in class and to take home; and (2) that sufficient textbooks and instructi
onal materials were provided 
to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content s
tandards and consistent with the cycles and content of the 
curriculum frameworks in English/language arts, math, science, and history
-

Types of Services Funded
 
Federal Title I funds help support staff development for teachers to 
improve instructional practice, pay for supplemental resources and 
materials to support curriculum and instruction, and pay for parent
-
involvement activities th
roughout the school year. In addition, one of our 
dedicated educational assistants is also funded through Title I and works 
directly with students in our reading program.
 
 
Supplemental and Concentration funds pay for four bilingual educational 
assistants w
ho provide direct services to students in need. These funds are 
also used to purchase materials and supplies for classrooms and pay for 
translators for parent conferences.
 
 
Our PTA also raises funds for field trips, assemblies, and classroom supplies 
throughout the year.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information 
about this school and compariso
ns of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports 
for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
le
arners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are 
publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet 
at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come
, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, 
the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending on 
availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, 
and the ability to print documents.

) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to pr
otect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level p
ercentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who received scores.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil 
suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Staff members monitor the school grounds for 30 minutes before school as well as all recess and lunch times. Teachers and sup
port staff regula
rly teach, 
practice, and review the rules for safe, respectful, and responsible behavior in school and on the playground. All visitors a
re required to enter the school 
through the main office and sign in. They receive a badge to wear throughout their stay 
on campus.
 
 
We revise our School Safety Plan annually; it was last revised in the spring of 2019. The plan includes procedures for emerge
ncies, exit routes, and 
supplies. This plan is shared with our staff, School Site Council/Advisory and Information Comm
ittee, and English Language Learner Committee. It is also 
available in the office for review. We currently house a three
-
day food and water supply for our students and staff in the event of an emergency. We 
practice fire drills and hold earthquake drills t
hroughout the year.
 
 
In addition to our School Safety Plan, we have a Safe School Action Plan. Included in this plan are our mission statement, sc
hool narrative, and goals 
regarding people and programs at El Cerrito School.
