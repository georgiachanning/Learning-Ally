School Description
 
Located in Crows Landing, California, we are one of six traditional schools in the Newman
-
Crows 
Landing Unified School District.  We are also the smallest of the four elementary schools in the 
district.  We have 144 students.  17% are En
glish Learners, 50% are low socioeconomic and less 
than 8% are special education students.  The small student body provides parents with a greater 

School is co
mmitted to creating and maintaining an orderly, trusting, and caring environment 
where teaching and learning are exciting and students are assisted as they develop responsibility. 
All aspects of the school's organization, curricular, and co
-
curricular acti
vities are child centered 
and designed to accommodate individual learning styles so that all may experience success. The 
Bonita Learning Community believes that all learners must become:
 
 

 
Effective Communicators who will use verbal, written, artistic and 
technological forms of 
communication to give, send, and receive information.
 
 

 
Inspired Learners who are accountable for demonstrating, assessing, and directing their 
present and life
-
long intellectual growth.
 
 

 
Productive Workers who perform collaborative
ly and independently to create quality 
products and services that reflect personal pride and responsibility.
 
 

 
Responsible Citizens who have a global and multi
-
cultural perspective, and who take the 
initiative for improving the quality of life for self and
 
others.
 
 

 
Resourceful Thinkers who independently and creatively strive to solve complex problems 
through reflection, risk taking, and critical evaluation.
 
 
As we move forward this year will will focus on the following areas:  Literacy accross all content 
areas, Technology Integration, Math Improvement, Facilities that are safe and welcoming, Positive 
Relationships with/between parents, students, teachers and administration.

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

In the past 3 year period teachers have been provided an average of 25 days of professional development.  The focus has been 
on preparing teachers for 
continued implementation of 
California's Math and English Language Arts Standards and also preparing staff for the transition to the Next Generation 
Science Standards.   We have also focused on integration of technology as a resource in the classroom to teachers and student
s.  Teache
rs were also 
given release time throughout the school year to align curriculum and instruction to the new standards, prepare lessons and c
ollaborate with peers on 
best practices. We have also began a professional development plan for all teachers TK
