By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
College View Elementary School is located in the western region of Huntington Beach, and serves students in Transitional 
Kindergarten through fifth gr
ade, and has a long history of demonstrating high levels of student academic achievement 
and reducing the achievement gap. We maintain a consistent focus on improving student achievement through our 
collaborative goal setting and our commitment to on
-
going
 
professional development.  Our highly qualified staff, which 
includes three Ocean View School District Elementary Teachers of the Year, provide effective standards
-
based instruction 
and a positive learning environment for all students.  We are very proud 
that College View houses the district DHH  (Deaf 
and Hard of Hearing) Program, and we offer students, at all grade levels, classes in American Sign Language.
 
 
Our commitment to utilize current researched
-
based programs and teaching strategies allows our st
aff to provide state 
of the art instruction and project
-
based learning opportunities. Our English Language Arts instruction is enhanced by our 
school
-
wide reading program, Accelerated Reader.  We enthusiastically support our Mathematics instruction with th
e ST 
Math Program. All classrooms have access to Chromebooks. As a legacy school, we have partnered with the Los Alamitos 
Army Base to annually provide our 5th grade students with a one week Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) 
experience.
 
 
Co
llege View Elementary School has a high standard for student behavior aligned to our PBIS expectations and Restorative 
Practices guidelines. At College View, we intentionally build relationships with our students based on trust, respect 
themselves, others,
 
and school property, empathy, and a sense of belonging and community in and out of the classroom. 
We believe that all students can behave in a safe and appropriate manner. With this in mind, the staff works hard to take 
a unified approach to social/emotio
nal learning, behavior, and school climate. We continue to implement our Positive 
Behavior Support Program (PBIS), a research
-
based, school
-
wide plan designed to create a safe, secure, pleasant 
environment. This initiative is meant to reinforce the positiv
e behaviors of students meeting specific behavior 
expectations as well as support students who need extra assistance to reach the school
-
wide expectations. We also follow 
the tenants of Restorative Practices by resolving conflicts and making decisions with
 
those most directly involved. It is 
important for students to understand how their words and actions affect others and what needs to happen to move 

rst five months, 
and then the last five months we review the traits again. Our five focus traits are: Be Responsible, Kind, Respectful, Have 
Perseverance and Integrity. Each trait is defined and taught in detail in both classroom and non
-
classroom settings
, 
including the playground, lunch benches, bathroom, transition areas, and bus area. Students are recognized for their 
positive behavior daily, weekly, monthly, and at trimester award assemblies, including monthly visits to the College View 
Student Store.
 
 
The entire staff takes great pride in our school. Our commitment to excellence is prevalent in every aspect of our day, and 
our community members echo this sentiment. Our school facility is well maintained, clean, and safe.  As a matter of pride, 
our Head
 

shows! College View has a welcoming family atmosphere.  All of our  children  receive an exemplary education while 
feeling supported socially an
d emotionally by our compassionate and caring staff.  College View Elementary School focuses 
on preparing all students to become independent learners with the skills and abilities necessary for a successful and 
productive future. Our high standard of educa
tion is facilitated in a safe and enriching learning environment, which is 
student
-
centered and directed by teachers who encourage support from home and the community.

Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
In November of 2016, the Ocean View School District (OVSD) passed Measure R, a general obligation bond, in the amount 
of 169 million dollars. This is the first bond ever passed in the 
143 year history of OVSD. The bond program is designed to 
transform the aging fleet of 1960/1970 era schools into modern, contemporary learning environments. Construction 
started in late June of 2018 and is anticipated to take approximately eight years to 
complete ending somewhere in the 
2024/2025 school year.

The District currently embraces a systematic approach to maintaining the current facilities to ensure that all schools are 
clean, safe, and provide an inspirational educational environment for our st
udents to learn, grow, and be challenged. 
District maintenance and site custodial staff work in a coordinated manner to ensure that the repairs and operational 
items necessary to keep the schools in good condition are completed in a timely manner. A compre
hensive work order 
system is utilized by school and District staff to communicate both routine and non
-
routine maintenance requests. 
Emergency repairs are given the highest priority. 
 
 
From an operational perspective, the custodian inspects the facilities 
for safety hazards or other conditions that need 
attention prior to students and staff entering school grounds. One full
-
time day custodian and one or two part
-
time 
evening custodian(s) are assigned to each school site. The day custodian is responsible for
:
 

 
Lunch area setup/cleanup
 

 
General grounds maintenance
 

 
Grounds keeping
 

 
Restroom cleaning
 
 
Restrooms are checked regularly throughout the day for cleanliness and subsequently cleaned as needed. The evening 
custodian is responsible for:
 

 
Classroom cleaning
 

 
Of
fice area cleaning
 

 
Restroom cleaning
 
 
The principals are in continual communication with the Maintenance and Operations Supervisors and custodial staff 
concerning maintenance and school safety issues.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan was developed for College View Elementary School in collaboration with 
College View's staff, School Site Council, English Language 
Advisory Council, local agencies, and the District Office, to fulfill 
the requirements of Senate Bill 187. Components of this plan include child abuse reporting procedures, teacher 
notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response, procedures f
or safe arrival and departure from school, 

and discussed with school staff, and our School Site and English Language Advisory Councils 
on September 26, 2019.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is designed to maintain an orderly and purposeful place where students and staff 
are free to learn and teach without the threat of physical and psychological harm. Annually the plan is reviewed w
ith all 
stakeholders and edited and revised to reflect the most accurate teacher, student, and community data and information.  
A school emergency checklist is required each year to assure that all aspects of the plan are updated.  Annually we calendar 
and
 
carry out emergency/disaster drills which include Lockdown and Shelter in Place. We  also update the inventory of 
supplies in the emergency bin; and purchase or replace supplies as needed.  Revision of our campus maps is imperative 
to identify the most ef
ficient emergency routes, alternative emergency routes, and emergency utility shut
-
offs.  
Emergency team staff assignments such as: Incident Command, Search and Rescue, Damage Assessment, First Aide Team, 
Student Release, and Student Supervision are assign
ed and procedures are rehearsed at our annual Great American 
Shakeout that occurs in October.   We also revise our buddy teacher and buddy student supervision lists.  A staff and 
community resource survey is conducted in September to identify staff and com
munity members with specific skills such 
as: First Aid, CPR, survival techniques, and individuals who are rescue certified who can be called into action in case of a 
disaster or earthquake.  Stakeholder input is given and reviewed after every emergency dri
ll, and changes are made to 
improve our emergency response.  In addition, our School Safety Plan outlines specific procedures to address bullying that 
adhere to our District policies and dovetails with our Positive Behavior Intervention and Support (PBIS) 
Program.

The days represented above only represent opportunities that ALL teachers participate in throughout the year. District 
committee work or content area teams training are not calculated in the 
total above. Elementary has 2 non
-
student days 
of training, 1 day of site
-
based foundational skills training, and 1.5 days to analyze data and develop an action plan totaling 
4.5 days for ALL elementary teachers. Middle School also has the 2 non
-
student da
ys and the 1.5 data days totaling 3.5 
days for ALL middle school teachers.
 
There are two non
-
student days included in the District calendar that focus on professional learning each year. At 
elementary sites Wednesdays are modified days. Students are releas
ed early to allow time for teachers to focus on 
professional learning, collaboration, and planning. Two Wednesdays a month are devoted to professional learning and 
collaboration and the other two Wednesdays are for collaboration and teacher planning. Middl
e School will have 10 early 
release Thursdays starting in the 2019
-
2020 school year to allow for professional learning, collaboration, and planning as 
well. There are also 1.5 days allotted to each school site to review data and create planned actions base
d on the data. 
Other professional learning opportunities are made available for teachers who are representing their school and bringing 
back information and professional learning provided for school site administrators to bring back and share with staff.
 
O
cean View School District has a Roadmap that is collaboratively developed with stakeholders. This Roadmap defines the 
professional development needs of the students and staff across the district. It is also used to develop the Local Control 
Accountability 
Plan (LCAP) and School Plans (SPSA). The focus for the professional learning in TK
-
5 schools has been on 
Foundational Skills for Literacy, Diagnostic assessments to inform instruction, and using a toolkit of resources to 
differentiate instruction for all s
tudents. In middle school the focus has been on developing and implementing new 
integrated science units, writing in science, and training teachers to conduct a History
-
Social Science pilot of instructional 
materials. All schools have been working on Socia
l
-
Emotional learning, Positive Behavior Instructional Support (PBIS), and 
some of the schools have been trained in restorative practices. Throughout the year, teaching staff are provided the 
opportunity to participate in District
-
sponsored staff developmen
t workshops or training sessions as:
 
1) a supplement to site
-
based staff development,
 
2) for reinforcement of or follow
-
up on previous training,
 
3) follow
-
up training for newly implemented programs/curricula.
