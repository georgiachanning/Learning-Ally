By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the scho
ol, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., tes
t data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (dep
ending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Built in 1978, Rolling Hills Elementary School recently celebrated its 40th anniversary of helping students learn and grow 
in our Rancho Penasquitos community. Currently our school educates 435 students in Transitional Kindergarten through 
fifth
 
grade, including 20 students on the Autism Spectrum in Special Day classes.
 
 
We also educate over 90 preschool 
students in our two full day regular preschool classes, two half
-
day state
-
funded preschool classes, and one Autism 
Spectrum preschool class. Th
e PUSD daycare for children of employees, known as the Poway Early Learning Center (PEARL 
Center), resides on campus and provides day care services for around 45 children from six weeks to three years of age.
 
 
This 
range of ages allows for unique opportuni
ties on our campus for cross
-
age and cross
-
grade learning experiences.
 
 
 
 
 
Rolling Hills enjoys the support of an active school Foundation and many parent and community volunteers. The 
Foundation supports our school and community goals to provide resources
 
that address the needs of the "whole child."
 
 
In 
addition to providing resources for academic intervention, our Foundation provides funds for instruction in music, physical 
education, and technology, areas that we consider essential components to a well
-
r
ounded education. By providing a rich 
educational experience for all students with multiple pathways to access learning, we believe our students gain confidence 
in themselves, advocate for their learning, and understand the importance of being a lifelong l
earner. Our community 

evident throughout our campus as we work together to meet and exceed our goals.
 
 
 
Mission:
 
 
Rolling Hills is dedi
cated to reaching each student by building positive relationships, providing a rigorous and 
relevant education, and instilling the positive values and attitudes that are necessary for college and
 
career
 
readiness and 
lifelong success in a diverse and globa
l society.

School Facility Conditions and

The Poway Unified School District ensures that students attend clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by
 
the State of California to 
ensure that each of its schools is maintained in good repair.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms,
 
offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and well maintained.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A night custodial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms and offices daily.  
The
 
district has adopted cleaning standards for all schools.  A summary of these standards is available at the district offices.

School Safety 
Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Rolling Hills places strong emphasis on safety for students and staff. We are committed to ensuring a safe, orderly, and 
attractive learning environment by assuring the following: 
 

 
A comprehensive emergency/safety plan and sear
ch and rescue plans are reviewed and updated at the beginning 
of every school year and as needed throughout the year.
 
 
The Site Safety Plan includes two goals: (1) Social 
Climate: to promote a culture of kindness to improve overall community relations; and
 
(2) Physical Safety: to 
develop, implement, and communicate site procedures for intruder on campus.
 

 
A school Safety Committee comprised of representatives from all site based programs, law enforcement, and 
parents
 
meets yearly to discuss and review the sa
fety plan, drill procedures, and to address improvements where 
needed and as needed.
 

 
Annual staff and student training procedures and drills for earthquakes, fire, lock down, search/rescue, and bus 
evacuation are held. 
 

 
Annual fire inspections are conducte
d by our local Fire Department. 
 

 
Maintenance staff consistently inspects school grounds, play equipment, and buildings
 
to ensure a safe 
environment and to
 
prevent costly repairs.

Research supports the positive effects professional development has on increasing student learning. All teaching staff is 
afforded the opportunity to participate in district and 
site sponsored professional development. These workshops are 
presented in a semester or year
-
long series and support a wide variety of professional development. These include the 
use of effective instructional strategies as aligned to the California State 
Standards, implementing the use of computer 
technology in teaching and learning, critical reading, writing and mathematics strategies, effective use of assessments, 
positive discipline, and cultural
 
competency
 
training. Teachers and administrators are acti
vely involved in professional 
development activities at the school, district, state, and national level. The Poway Professional Assistance Program (PPAP) 
provides support for new teachers. Teachers are encouraged to participate in the National Board Certif
ication process and 
recognized by the Poway Unified School District when they earn NBCT status. We are currently immersed in implementing 
the California State Standards and
 
aligning them
 
with classroom instruction and professional development initiatives i
n 
writing and math. 
 
The focus of staff development at Rolling Hills is increasing student achievement, particularly in math 
and reading, and in Tier I interventions.
 
 
Teacher leaders in English Language Arts, Math, and Science lead meetings and 
provide su
pport for staff in curriculum development and implementation. 
 
Goals are evaluated through teacher
-
principal 
meetings and student performance data analysis.
