By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Constructed in 1955, Beard Elementary School is located in north central Modesto at 915 Bowen Avenue. It is one of 
twenty
-
two elementary schools in the district. It serves a wide population of diverse students. The
 
school is in great 
condition due in part to the dedicated and caring staff. Students within our attendance area are mainly Hispanic and 
White. The income level of most families falls into the low socio
-
economic range.
 
 
The school serves a diverse group of
 
approximately 400 Kindergarten through 6th grade students. The student population 
is 80% socioeconomically disadvantaged and for 19% of our students English is their second language. The ethnic 
composition is Hispanic 50%, White 25%, African American 8%, 
Asian 4% and 13% other. Beard's population is comprised 
of students living in the local neighborhood with others arriving by bus from various neighborhoods around Modesto. In 
addition to 14 regular education K
-
6 classes, there are five Special Education cl
asses located on the Beard Campus, two 
Learning Handicapped and three Severely Handicapped classes. Students with Disabilities make up 23% of our student 
population.
 
 
Beard is an MTSS site. Students performing below grade level receive multiple layers of i
ntervention support to bridge the 
gap and increase academic performance. In the classroom, teachers teach English Language Arts with McGraw Hill, Engage 
New York (Eureka) Mathematics (1st 
-
 
6th grade), and Early Math with Engage NY as supplemental material
 
in 
kindergarten. We have adopted the Second Step: Skills for Social and Academic Success program to teach and reinforce 
social skills. RISE, our after school intervention program for grades 1 

 
6, focuses on reading foundational skills and serves 
approxim
ately 60 Beard students.
 
 
ASES, an after school program, serves approximately 140 students. Students receive homework assistance, social skills 
lessons, and character education. The ASES program also offers a variety of activities and sports for students. 
Beard has a 
computer lab with a full time computer literacy teacher. The teacher helps students become proficient in computer skills. 
Modesto City Schools also provides a Prep Provider who works weekly with students on a variety of skills from character 
tr
aits to physical education. A mentor program, through Stanislaus County, aides in assisting students with social skills, 
reading and math fluency, and character building.

Migrant Education /Title Part C 
supplemental instructional and support services are provided to the Modesto City Schools 
migrant students through a Memorandum of Understanding with the Merced County Office of Education/Migrant 
Education Region 3. These services are directly
 
 
provided by Migrant Education Region 3 staff to preschool and elementary students. Migrant Education supplemental 
instructional services are provided through a combination of site and home base models. Migrant students are identified 
and recruited by two S
upport Services Liaisons that are housed at Pearson

Education Center. The current migrant student eligibility list is maintained on a monthly basis and is cross
-
referenced with 
the district student data base to keep student lists current. The Supportive S
ervices Liaisons additionally provide referrals 
for supplemental health and social services to migrant families identified in the Modesto City Schools attendance area. 
The migrant parents assist the district and region in evaluating migrant educational ser
vices through their participation in 
the Migrant Parent
 
 
Advisory Committee that meets six times per year. Migrant Education services are determined each year in collaboration 
with the Modesto City Schools District to maintain or modify them based on a rev
iew of prior year services and funding 
allocations.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Beard provides 
opportunities for parent involvement in a variety of ways. Beard PTA is very active in supporting the 
students and teachers through fundraising and volunteer work. Each year we partner with LOVE Modesto to beautify our 
campus. In addition, we have communit
y members, students, and staff who work together adding to our already beautiful 
campus. Many of our teachers encourage parent involvement in the classroom especially at the primary grade levels. 
Teachers, in all grade levels, provide opportunities for par
ent helpers in the classroom. We also have two committees for 
parents to be involved. First, we have the English Learner Parent Partnership committee that meets with the Principal at 
least three times a year to discuss issues surrounding English Language L
earners. The second committee is the School Site 
Council. Members of this committee are elected by the Beard community and staff and oversee the Title I budget. If you 
want more information on any of these opportunities, please contact the school office.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Beard Elementary School Safety Plan was developed by California Safe Schools as part of a comprehensive district 
wide Safety Plan. The plan specific to Beard was developed with input.
 
 
from the Safety Committee made up of staff and parents. The complet
ed plan was reviewed by staff and parents before 
adoption. The plan is reviewed annually by staff and parents. The main purpose of the plan is to provide guidelines for a 
variety of possible emergencies that a school might encounter during the year. A list
 
of support staff, district personnel, 
and the community is made available.
 
 
Beard Elementary provides supervision of students 30 minutes prior to the start of the school day at the bus drop off area, 
the cafeteria, and the primary/intermediate playground.
 
Beard has a traffic patrol that monitors major crosswalks near 
the school both in the morning and directly after school. Yard duties provided after school supervision until the buses have 
departed. All visitors to the school must report to the office and 
be scanned in with our RAPTOR program. Visitors will 
then receive a sticker which must be worn while on campus. We lock all gates restricting access to the school. All staff 
members are instructed to question any adults on campus not wearing a visitor stic
ker and sent back to the office to sign 
in and obtain a sticker. The principal, head custodian, and campus supervisor patrol the school grounds regularly to ensure 
student safety and to address and safety concerns.

Professional development in MCS is data driven using research
-
based best practices to ensure our students receive 
guaranteed and viable curriculum in every grade, in every school.    We use formative and summative data to drive our 
instructional decisions 
and focus for professional development.  To this end, we utilize multiple structures  to provide 
high
-
quality professional development to our staff including:  summer training, preservice
-
days, district wide professional 
development days, after school work
shops, Saturday workshops, substitute
-
release days, instructional coaching, a BTSA 
and PAR program,  and most recently a 0.5% compensation package for those who choose to complete an extra 6 hours 
of professional development.
 
 
MCS has prioritized our focus
 
on mathematics, literacy across grades and content areas, collaboration, welcoming 
schools/customer service, and building our capacity as professionals.  This has been in addition to the needed training in 
new adoptions, curriculum and standard updates an
d the like.  The professional development is sustained through site 
administration, district and site level instructional coaches, and intervention specialists.  In the 2019
-
202 academic year, 
a new division was also created in order to increase the qualit
y and quantity of professional development provided to 
classified, certificated, and managers alike.
