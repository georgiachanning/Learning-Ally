About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
 
We have made a conscientious effort to provide a clean and attractive campus. Stud
ents are encouraged to have pride in their school and keep the 
campus clean. The District Governing Board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these
 
standards is available at 
the school office or at the district main
tenance office. The principal works daily with the custodial staff and the custodial supervisor to develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

The FIT is used on a yearly basis to identify facility needs and repairs. All items found in need of repair on the FIT are ad
dressed. Items that involve asphalt, 
roofing, flooring or painting are addressed through the District's deferred maintenance progra
m. All other items are expedited into the National School 
District work order system and repaired by our maintenance department.

The selection of focus areas for on
-
going professional development is based on a careful analysis of achievement data. The district calendar earmarks 
full days and early release time for providing site
-
based professional development for all teachers. Teach
ers also have opportunities to attend conferences 
and district
-
wide professional development throughout the year. During the 2018
-
19 school year all teachers at Las Palmas will receive approximately 
30 hours of professional development in mathematics throu
gh the University of California Irvine subject matter project. This professional development 
will empower our teachers to deliver a cohesive, common core curriculum based on the CCSS. The project includes hands
-
on, research
-
based professional 
development, 
standards
-
based curriculum guides and unit plans aligned to the Common Core to assist our teachers in the implementation of our GoMath 
adoption. The Irvine Math Project team is comprised of classroom practitioners, math content experts, and math education 
researchers. A focus on 
professional development around the area of mathematics and ELA was selected in response to the needs highlighted in our CAAS
PP data. In the area of 
language arts, all of our teachers will receive in
-
depth professional development i
n the California ELA/ELD framework. The ELA/ELD framework 
professional development has been selected as an area of focus due to our high numbers of English language learners and the n
eed for teachers to 
deliver robust and rigorous lessons. Both these areas
 
of focus have been delivered through teacher release days, bi
-
weekly data team meetings, 
collaboration days and weekly staff meetings, off the clock offerings and during individual teacher planning days. We have fo
ur Teachers on Special 
Assignment (TOSA) 
that provide workshops in the area of Language Arts and English Language Development.  With our new English Language Arts 
adoption, all teachers will receive staff development in the implementation of our newly adopted BENCHMARK materials. To supp
ort daily
, robust and 
rigorous reading, our district office has adopted the American Reading Company 100 book libraries. All teachers will receive 
staff development on the 
implementation and best practices used for these reading baskets for students. Our counselors
 
have received training on the Sanford Harmony social
-
emotional curriculum which they will deliver in each classroom. Counselors will deliver this curriculum in all classrooms whi
le teachers support the 
implementation and lesson delivery. In addition, all 
teachers have received professional development on how to run restorative circles in their classrooms 
in order to deliver Tier I positive behavior interventions and supports to all students. of focus for teacher training includ
e effective instructional str
ategies 
for implementation of Common Core Standards, best practices for Data Teams collaboration, ELA Benchmark curriculum, curriculu
m training in writing, 
language arts and mathematics, as well as specific training to support the needs of English Learners
. Teachers of students with special needs and teachers 
of newcomer students also receive specialized training to assist them in meeting the unique needs of their students. This pro
fessional development is 
provided in various formats, including whole staff 
group, grade
-
level teams, and through individual mentoring by the school administrator. The District 
also assists in the coordination of BTSA Induction Support for year one and two teachers. Teachers who are experiencing diffi
culty or need improvement 
have
 
access to the PAR (Peer Assistance Review) Program.
