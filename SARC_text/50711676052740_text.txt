By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
In 1956, La Loma Junior High School opened with space for 650 students. This year, there are 711 seventh and eighth 
grade students who populate the school from both sides of Yosemite Blvd. Inclusion of students fro
m all parts of the socio
-
economic spectrum provides for a unique and diverse student demographic. Currently, 75% of our student population 
participates in the free or reduced lunch program.
 
 
La Loma JHS today boasts a wide array of educational and support 
services for students from diverse ethnic, racial and 
socioeconomic backgrounds. 27% of our students identify themselves as White/Caucasian, 56% as Hispanic or Latino, 2% 
African
-
American, and 4% Asian. 5% claim a dual ethnicity. We are home to four Specia
l Education programs (Resource 
Specialist, SDC Learning Handicapped, Deaf and Hard of Hearing, and Severely Emotionally Disturbed), and have itinerant 
services for students with other disabilities. 80 students are enrolled in band or orchestra; we also hav
e an 50
-
voice Chorus 
that performs throughout the city and in Disneyland each year.
 
 
The main buildings, erected in 1956, have been augmented with portable classrooms, a gymnasium and three computer 
labs. A new cafeteria was completed in March, 2003, to se
rvice our student population through a two lunch
-
period system. 
All classrooms now have air
-
conditioning and upgraded electrical wiring. During the summer of 2002, a science lab was 
completely renovated. Modernization of La Loma began in February, 2004, an
d was completed in September, 2005.  A 
new blacktop was finished the summer of 2014.  Technology upgrades are on
-
going. A new telephone system went online 
January, 2017.
 
 
Classrooms received a face lift, which included new marker boards, tack boards, paint
, and exterior door replacement. 
Full abatement, re
-
roofing, interior and exterior painting, fire alarm upgrades, security alarm, security cameras and 
restroom upgrades have also been completed. Staff and student restrooms have new tile and are ADA complia
nt. The 
custodial staff at La Loma takes great pride in keeping the campus in spotless condition, and they have consistently won 
Modesto City Schools District awards for their diligence. They were honored at a Board of Education meeting in October 
2009 for
 
receiving an outstanding inspection rating.  The custodial staff continues to maintain high standards.
 
 
The Center for Human Services, a local non
-
profit organization, provides counseling through its Student Assistant Specialist 
program. One specialist is
 
on our campus five days a week to provide conflict mediation, Alcohol and Other Drug 
education, referrals for counseling, and risky behaviors interventions as well as many other related services. Another 
specialist is assigned to our intervention center t
o provide counseling services related to proper school behavior.  Starting 
in 2019, a third specialist was added to focus on student attendance and parent relations.  Our academic counselor is on 

gress toward meeting graduation requirements. The WEB 
(Where Everybody Belongs) program was implemented beginning in 2006
-
07. Like Link Crew in high school, the program 
trains over 80 8th
-
grade students in leadership skills and strategies to welcome, assis
t, and provide ongoing support for 
incoming 7th graders in order to facilitate and ease the difficult transition from elementary to junior high school.

Students requiring additional assistance may be enrolled in a Math 8 Support period in addition to 
their Math 8 class or a 
Math
-
180 Support period in addition to their Math 7 class. Students may be enrolled in a two
-
period block for reading 
intervention. Eighth grade English Learners who are not yet reclassified are enrolled in an Academic Language 
Deve
lopment course or READ
-
180 course to strengthen their skills to provide students with the support they need in order 
to assist them in accessing the curriculum. Seventh grade students not yet reclassified are enrolled in AVID Excel in additio
n 
to their Lan
guage Arts classes.  These students also participated in a Summer Bridge program to prepare them for the 
rigors of junior high school curriculum.  Resource students are enrolled in a Resource Tutorial class that teaches 
organizational skills, study habits,
 
and provides academic support. Students who show the ability, but might lack the 
support or resources to enter college, are recruited into the AVID program (Advancement Via Individual Determination) 
where they learn note
-
taking, organization, responsibili
ty, collaboration, and receive tutoring in their academic classes. 
Students with exceptional academic prowess are enrolled in honors classes. Students may enroll in music, computer, 
yearbook, drama, leadership, or the STAR Center courses that allow student
s to explore more deeply STEM courses 
(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). We have 2 STAR Center courses: Future City, Engineering & Design 
and Robotics & Renewable Energy.
 
 
More than half of the full
-
time teachers have been 
teaching at La Loma for at least ten years. Our teachers coach after
-
school athletic teams and advise academic programs such as Science Olympiad, Math Super Bowl, Future City Competition, 
WEB (Where Everyone Belongs) program, CJSF (California Junior Schola
rship Federation) and more. They also model the 

performance, we have various recognition efforts underway on an ongoing basis, including Students of
 
the Month and 
our ASB
-
driven Lancer Awards program, which recognizes students whose grades reflect a GPA of 3.0 or higher for 

during zer
o period, at lunch and after school for students to either drop in or to be referred to by their classroom teachers.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
La Loma maintains a safe learning environment before, during, and after school. Staff and student safety are of the utmost 
priority for administration, teachers, and students. The school employs two full
-
time campus supervisors and two yard 
duty
 
personnel who are responsible for maintaining a vigilant presence on campus at all times. The district has provided 
added after school coverage with two school safety officers.  La Loma reviews and updates its safety plans and procedures 
once each semeste
r and/or as needed throughout the school year. There is a new suggestion box available to provide an 
avenue for staff to provide feedback regarding possible safety issues.  Regularly scheduled fire and lock down drills are 
conducted.  Security cameras were
 
added in the fall of 2019, along with a single point of entry system utilizing the Raptor 
Visitor Identification program to track and monitor visitors on campus.
 
 
The administration and the entire Physical Education Department have been trained in the pro
per use of the two, newly 
installed Automated External Defibrillator (AED) devices on campus.  Upon arrival at La Loma, visitors are greeted with a 
large sign directing them to the office area where they sign in, meet our receptionist, and those seeking cl
earance to enter 

in monitoring students on a rotating basis in order to maintain a safe and calm school campus.  The safety committee
 
meets annually to review the plan.   There were minor changes in some of the adjunct duty locations for supervision that 
the staff had already agreed to for the 2017
-
18 school year.

Professional development in MCS is data driven using research
-
based best practices to ensure our students receive 
guaranteed and viable curriculum in every grade, in every school.    We use formative and summative data to 
drive our 
instructional decisions and focus for professional development.  To this end, we utilize multiple structures  to provide 
high
-
quality professional development to our staff including:  summer training, preservice
-
days, district wide professional 
d
evelopment days, after school workshops, Saturday workshops, substitute
-
release days, instructional coaching, a BTSA 
and PAR program,  and most recently a 0.5% compensation package for those who choose to complete an extra 6 hours 
of professional developme
nt.
 
 
MCS has prioritized our focus on mathematics, literacy across grades and content areas, collaboration, welcoming 
schools/customer service, and building our capacity as professionals.  This has been in addition to the needed training in 
new adoptions, 
curriculum and standard updates and the like.  The professional development is sustained through site 
administration, district and site level instructional coaches, and intervention specialists.  In the 2019
-
202 academic year, 
a new division was also creat
ed in order to increase the quality and quantity of professional development provided to 
classified, certificated, and managers alike.
