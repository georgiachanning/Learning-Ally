By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The BOMUSD purchases instructional materials for Otter Creek through a curriculum
-
adoption process that aligns itself 
with the state adoption timelines. 
Our School Site Council commits substantial funding to purchase supplemental and 
ancillary materials to complete the commitment that all students have first
-
class instructional materials. The School Site 
Council actively participates in the implementation 
of Common Core State Standards in English language arts, mathematics 
and science. Tara West Kinder and Firstie Math and Pearson EnVisionMath were implemented for grades TK
-
5, in 2015 
and 2017. Benchmark Advance for English language arts was implemented for
 
grades K
-
6 in 2016. Textbooks for 
history/social science were adopted in 2004.
 
 
Scott Foresman Science is used in grades K
-
5 and Prentice Hall Science for grade 6. Our new science lab garden provides 
an outdoor learning environment for the exploration of 
earth, life and physical science.
 
 
Common Core State Standards, Otter Creek School and the district Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) guide the 
instructional program at Otter Creek. Leadership of the school is a team effort based on the philosop
hy of shared decision
-
making. Parents, teachers and classified employees are actively involved in the decision
-
making process. Parent input is 
derived through the School Site Council and informal parent meetings.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Otter Creek School Student Safety: Student safety is a top priority at Otter Creek School. Student behavior is exemplary, 
and school suspensions are rare.
 
 
Emergency preparedness is essential, considering the location of the school. The staff works closely
 
with district personnel 
to establish procedures that ensure student safety. This includes monthly fire drills and an annual lockdown drill.
 
 
Inclement weather sometimes restricts bus access to the school and requires students and staff to hold school in t
wo 

and staff hold school in a classroom near the district office in Georgetown.
 
 
Emergency procedures: In the event of an emergency or com
munity disaster, such as fire, highway closures due to earth 
slides, chemical spills or other disaster, these procedures will be followed.
 
 

necessitates canceling instructional sessions will be determined after considering the best available information 
concerning the nature and c
ircumstances of the emergency.
 
 
When practical, decisions will be based on information received from law enforcement, fire departments, forestry officials 
or other publicsafety personnel.
 
 
When it is decided that the emergency does not present a hazardous 
situation for the children, they will continue their 
normally scheduled school day, and the source and condition of the emergency will be closely monitored through locally 
involved agencies. Minimum supplies of food, water, shelter and emergency toilet fac
ilities will be kept at the school for 
use in the event children, out of necessity, remain at the school for an extended period. The staff member in charge of 
the students shall have in his or her possession all Emergency Notification Cards, the parent tel
ephone tree lists and 
emergency series telephone lists.
 
 
If it is necessary to cancel classes, the superintendent and staff will contact every parent or guardian or the individual th
e 
parent has listed on the Emergency Notification Card to inform them of t
he status of the impending emergency. In the 
event telephones at the school are not in working order, the superintendent, staff and children will remain at the school 
until all notifications have been made through alternate communications and all of the ch
ildren have been dispersed to 
authorized individuals. If enrollment exceeds 15 different families, the district automated telephone system should be 
employed in order to complete notification in a timely manner. This may also be the best method of notifica
tion if the 
area telephone service is operational, but the school telephones are out of order.

Professional development includes staff development days, conferences, workshops and participation in professional 
development activities. There are in
-
service opportunities available yearly for classified and certified staff. The staff has 
been actively i
nvolved in the creation of the staff
-
development plan for the school year. Teacher leaders take an active 
role in planning and implementing staff development.
 
The curriculum at Otter Creek is based on the district course of study in language arts; the Dist
rict Curriculum Guide for 
Parents; and the state Curriculum Frameworks in language arts, mathematics, science, history and social science, and 
visual and performing arts.
 
In 2018
-
19, there were three days dedicated to professional development with a focus 
on our RTI systems of districtwide 
intervention, NTN, PBIS as well as Lexia Reading intervention and ALEKS Math intervention.
 
In 2019
-
20, there are three district days dedicated to professional development with a focus on Projects that engage 
learners, RTI
 
Intervention,  and math intervention cycles.
 
We plan collaborative time for teachers strategically so that both teachers and students benefit, and it is done with SED 
(School Enrichment Days). We use this time to study, examine student work, collaborate a
nd do team building. Our goal 
this year is mathematics alignment and intervention.
 
This year, we have six scheduled SED days. On these special days, teachers are released from classroom responsibilities 
and are able to use data to examine student performan
ce related to the Common Core State Standards and explore topics 
developed during summer professional development. This examination is used to determine how to drive instruction at 
Otter Creek in the future.
 
Additionally, Otter Creek has staff receiving pr
ofessional development from the El Dorado County Office of Education, El 
Dorado County Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA), and other organizations and educational institutions.
