Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or 
programs 
of study.

Parents and the community are very supportive of the educational programs at Redwood Elementary School. Many 
opportunities exist at Redwood School for parents to become involved and become a member or our educational 
community. We have an active and growin
g Parent Teacher Student Organization (PTSO) which is always looking for new 
members. Our PTSO organizes fundraisers and assists in school wide events as well as parent nights. They are instrumental 
in our Carnival Night which brings in about 2,000 communi
ty members and families.We also have a very active RAD 
(Redwood Awesome Dads) group on campus daily providing extra support for our at risk students as well as an extra set 
of eyes durin transitions and breaks.
 
 
We also have an active and supportive SSC (S
chool Site Council) which helps us with our spending of Title 1 Funds and sets 
academic and social goals for each year.
 
 
Redwood School hosts weekly assemblies, monthly movie nights, Back to School Night in the Fall and a STEAM Night in 
the Spring. We also
 
host an end of the year BBQ for the entire school. We have weekly classroom performances at 
Redwood School highlighted at our weekly assemblies and we also have band concerts and a school wide Christmas 
program.
 
 
Redwood School invites all parents to part
icipate in the student led conferences in the Fall as well as in the Spring. We 
have monthly awards assemblies where approximately 75 students are awarded for excellence in academics as well as 
behavior (Leadership and Responsible Student Club).
 
 
Redwood S
chool implements Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS). The link between families and PBIS is 
an important one. We know that when families are meaningfully involved in educational activities their children do better 
in schools. Families pla
y an important part in their child's education and social development. The presence of parents in 
schools not only provides additional academic supports but also creates community and cultural connections.
 
 
We have an open door policy and parents are alway
s encouraged to visit and volunteer in our classrooms throughout the 
school.(We have volunteer forms in the office.) Redwood also provides many opportunities to assist with field trips, 
graduation ceremonies (Kind. and 8th grade), Fire Prevention Day (Fort
 
Dick Fire Department), Title VI Program and our 
athletics program which includes Co
-
ed Soccer, Boy's and Girl's Basketball, Volleyball, Track and Cheer Leading. Redwood 
is taking the lead on Safety protocols in the district and is working with local law e
nforcement to be trained on first aid 
and trauma.

Professional Learning Communities: District

wide grade level PLC groups meet almost weekly to focus on three 
big ideas. 1. Ensuring that students learn. 2. Ensuring a culture of collaboration. 3. A focus on results. These 
meetings are a powerful opportunit

county.
 

 
Positive Behavior Intervention and Support (PBIS): Our school PBIS team has developed a school
-
wide matrix of 
behavior expectations in common areas on campus. 
Teachers have developed a corresponding matrix of 
expectations for their own classrooms. Students are positively acknowledged for being safe, respectful, and 
responsible in all areas at school. PBIS is discussed and reviewed at every staff meeting two Mond
ays a month 
as well as monthly PBIS leadership team meetings.
