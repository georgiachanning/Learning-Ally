School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019

20)
 
Although nestled on the outskirts of the small rural mountain community of Julian, California, Julian Union School District 
functions as the hub and center of the community. The school plays an integral part in the l
ives of the families, the 
neighboring businesses and the surrounding community. The quaint, rustic looking town of Julian is located sixty miles 
northeast of San Diego, and is an extremely popular tourist retreat throughout the year. Known as the apple cou
ntry, the 
old fashioned, picturesque towns privacy and close knit community atmosphere is highly valued by the local townspeople, 
many of whose families have lived in the area for several generations. Julian Union is a school district consisting of one 
ele
mentary and one junior high school. Since the attendance area encompasses 618.6 square miles, and its boundaries go 
from the desert floor to the top of the mountains, the school buses provide the lifeline between students and the schools.
 
The community inc
ome is derived mainly from cattle ranching, apple farming, and tourism. Many parents commute off the 
mountain to work in the city since the community has no large business or industry. The school district is the largest 
employer in the community. The popul
ation has remained fairly constant the last few years, although the expectations for 
future growth, looms on the horizon.
 
 

 
Our Mission is... To provide every student success in learning. We are 
dedicated to the individual development of attitudes, 
skills, know ledge, and responsibility essential to successful achievement in school and society. We actively involve parents
  
and the community in supporting student learning and development.
 
 
To Fulfi
ll our Mission... We are committed to a strong and comprehensive educational program and learning environment 
which enhances character, provides role models, optimizes each child's potential, develops a lifelong love of learning, build
s 
personal responsibi
lity, provides opportunities to serve, and accentuates individual respect.
 
 
Fundamental to our Mission... Is a commitment to the active involvement of a competent and caring staff, teamwork, shared 
leadership, the effective management of resources, and a s
afe and orderly learning environment. We pride ourselves on 
our dedication to our students, families, community, each other, our profession, and to continuous learning.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
Developing positive self
-
esteem and healthy peer 
relationships is an important district focus. Students receive support from 
trained health clerks and a county psychologist. The district funded a program to support students and families. The district
 
also has programs designed to assist students who have
 
been identified at
-
risk. Students can be evaluated by the Student 
Study Team (SST), and interventions can be recommended. In all cases, careful and ongoing consultation with parents is 
maintained.

nty. Specifically, DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, 
course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter

mative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the
