By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Dear Parents,
 
It is with pleasure to present Pioneer Elementary School's School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The purpose

best educational program for our students. The 
excellent quality of our program is a reflection of our highly committed staff, the involvement of our parents, and our hard 
working students. We are dedicated to ensuring that our school provides a welcoming 
and stimulating learning 
environment where students are actively involved in learning academics as well as exemplifying positive character.
 
 
Together through our hard work, our students will be challenged to reach their maximum potential socially and

Our Pioneer Elementary School vision is aligned with the District vision and mission.  Pioneer Elementary School will ex
cel 
at creating an innovative nurturing learning environment where students, staff, and community are inspired to meet the 
challenges of our rigorous curriculum and work collaboratively to achieve success.
 
 
District and School Profile
 
Pioneer Union Element
ary School District (PUESD) is the oldest school district in Kings County. In 1993, Pioneer Union 
Elementary School District became the first charter school district in the state. Since its inception as the Pioneer Union 
Elementary Charter School District,
 
the district has experienced growth in ADA; increased test scores; expansion of 
programs, services, and offerings for students; and has seen an enhanced enthusiasm for "thinking out of the box" about 
public education. The school district, in existence sin
ce 1870, takes pride in meeting the needs of all its students, and as a 
result, the district enjoys the overwhelming support of its parents, teachers, and community members.The student 
population of the Pioneer Elementary is a mixture of children of farm w
orkers and farmers; professionals and 
homemakers; naval base officers and enlisted service personnel; small and large business owners; self
-
employed; and 
retirees.
 
 
To be more specific, the 2018
-
19 enrollment for Pioneer Elementary School was approximately
 
571 students (CALPADS 
Certified). The student population is made up of the following: 37.5% white (n=214), 48.7% Hispanic (n=278), 5.4% African 
American (n=31), 2.6% Asian (n=15), 2.3% Filipino (n=13), 0.4% American Indian (n=2), 0.4% Pacific Islander (n=
2), and 
2.5% other or multiple ethnicities (n=14). Of the 571 students at Pioneer during the 2018
-
2019 school year, 45.9% were 
socio
-
economically disadvantaged (SED) (n=262), 7.2% (n=41) students were English Learners (EL), 8.42% students 
received special 
education services (SPED) (n=47),  0.4% of students were Foster Youth (n=2), and 0.4% of students were 
Homeless (n=2). Pioneer's English Learners reportedly speak several different languages including Spanish, Arabic, 
Cambodian, Portuguese, Ibo and Tagalog
.  Furthermore, our suspension rate was at 0.4%.
 
 
Pioneer Elementary promotes a secure and friendly environment that serves the students and community in a variety of 
ways. The district core program provides rigorous instruction with high expectations for 
both staff and students and is 
focused on the acquisition of knowledge and skills of the State Academic Standards. Enrichment opportunities are offered 
through music, athletics, STEM, and leadership opportunities. Academic supports through differentiated i
nstruction within 
the classroom, reading labs, after school programs, and summer school programs provide safety nets for students needing 
additional and focused instruction.
 
 
Parents, teachers, and administrators frequently work together on school issues a
nd projects, including school structure, 
curriculum, school environment, and a variety of activities aimed at student success and maintaining the high expectations 
for all philosophy. Pioneer Elementary School has established a shared vision that assures w
e will excel at creating an 
innovative nurturing learning environment where students, staff, and community are inspired to meet the challenges of 
our rigorous curriculum and work collaboratively to achieve success. Staff members are highly qualified and su
pport the 
school's mission to provide a challenging curriculum in a safe, nurturing environment where academic, social, and 
emotional needs are met.
 
 
In order to achieve this vision, we offer a strong core academic program with current curricula that is St
ate Board of 
Education approved. Our curriculum is supported by high quality instruction. Our highly qualified teachers receive ongoing 
training to ensure knowledge of the standards, subject matter pedagogy, and strategies to engage all students in rigorou
s 
learning. We use both formative and summative assessments to inform teaching, monitor student progress, and to identify 
the needs of our students. A multi
-
tiered instructional intervention system is in place to provide the appropriate amount 
of support t
o each student. This system includes programs to meet the needs of special populations of students. Our Title 
I, Special Education, Section 504, English Learner, and Migrant programs are all critical parts of our intervention system. 
Additional strategic i
nterventions are provided to students who are not achieving grade
-
level standards that includes 
differentiated small group instruction and after school intervention opportunities in the areas of Mathematics.

During the 2018
-
2019 school year, Pioneer Eleme
ntary participated in the statewide CAASPP testing for Common Core.  
In English Language Arts, 57.3% of students met or exceeded standards in third through fifth grades. In Mathematics, 
49.11% of students met or exceeded standards in third through fifth gr
ades. In both English Language Arts and Math, we 
scored in the GREEN category on the California Department of Education Dashboard school accountability system.  The 
California School Dashboard provides parents and educators with meaningful information on s
chool and district progress 
so they can participate in decisions to improve student learning.
 
 
Pioneer Elementary was awarded the California Honor Roll presented by the Educational Results Partnership (ERP) and 
the Campaign for Business and Education 
Excellence (CBEE) for the last four years. We are proud of this accomplishment  
and are confident that with our continued strong academic focus, safe and supportive climate, and innovative technology 
our students will continue to perform well.
 
 
A full rang
e of technological tools are provided in every classroom to enhance instruction and prepare our students to 
learn in a 21st century environment. Teachers utilize a variety of technology for teaching lessons across content areas 
such as document cameras, in
teractive monitors, and Google Classroom.Technology tools for students also include one 
to one Chromebooks for students in second through fifth grades. These students utilize Google Classroom and incorporate 
technology across all curricular areas. All grad
es, first through fifth, also have opportunities weekly to receive direct 
computer lab instruction. In primary classes, there are also computer stations as well as roving computer carts with class 
sets of computers for check out that can be incorporated in
to whole class instruction.
 
 
Character education is another deeply embedded element of our curriculum. This includes a focus on the Character Counts 
pillars of Citizenship, Caring, Responsibility, Fairness, Respect, and Trustworthiness.We have a monthly pi
llar focus. During 
each month's focus we highlight that pillar and educate students on what the pillar means and ways they can exhibit that 
pillar. We also have incentives that award students when they are demonstrating these character traits. We integrate
 
a 
bully awareness and prevention program as an important part of our character education and highlight these programs 
with our positive behavior initiatives. This year we continue with our fifth year of implementing PBIS,  Positive Behavioral 
Intervention
s and Supports. The PBIS approach helps to sustain our positive collaborative school culture and keep our 
staff and students focused on academic achievement. One focus of PBIS is to promote our school
-
wide expectations, 
PAWS, as a means to promote positive
 
behaviors in both classroom and non
-
classroom settings. PAWS stands for Be 
Proud, Be Aware, Be Wise, and Be Safe. Student training for PBIS consists of a full training where students rotate around 
the campus to learn about how to put their best PAWS forwa
rd in non
-
classroom settings. In addition, there are follow up 
trimester assemblies and incentives when students show their "PAWS." We are pleased to announce that Pioneer 
Elementary was awarded the Bronze Medal Champion Model System for our PBIS program d
uring the 2014
-
2015 school 
year. In 2015
-
2016 we were awarded the Silver Medal for PBIS and in 2016
-
2017 Pioneer Elementary was awarded the 
Gold Medal for PBIS. Since then, Pioneer Elementary has worked to maintain its Gold Medal status. In addition, Pione
er 
was awarded the Bonner Center Character and Civic Education Award for the 2015
-
2016 school year for our outstanding 
school
-
wide Character and Civic Education Programs. We are required to wait for an additional 4 years until we can apply 
for the Bonner C
haracter Education award again, which we anticipate in the upcoming year. Another way Pioneer 
Elementary builds character and leadership skills in students is through our Student Council and Panther Pals Program. 
Such opportunities are available for 4th an
d 5th grade students. Student Council is responsible for planning and running 
all of our character and spirit rallies and hosts many school
-
wide events. Panther Pals is a student ambassador program 
that is designed to train students in conflict resolution 
and tutoring younger students in the classroom setting both in 
general and special education classes. Panther Pals apply their learned skills on the younger students' playground by 
helping them solve minor problems by taking them through the conflict
-
resol
ution steps. In the classroom setting, 
teachers train and mentor students to tutor struggling students and be their mentor.
 
 
In addition to a strong academic and character building programs, Pioneer Elementary also focuses on health and 
performing arts. Pi
oneer offers Physical Education as well as opportunities for instruction in music in the 4th and 5th 
grades.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
School Facilities
 
 
Pioneer Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for learning through proper f
acilities maintenance and 
campus supervision. Ongoing maintenance and improvements ensure campus facilities remain up to date and provide 
adequate space for students and staff. All classrooms are on a five
-
year rotation schedule for replacement of flooring
.
 
 
Campus Maintenance
 
The district administers a scheduled maintenance program to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well
-
maintained 
and in good repair. The district's maintenance department manages larger projects that may require third party 
c
ontractors. School custodians are qualified and equipped to handle minor routine repairs and maintenance projects.
 
 
An informal work order process is used to forward requests for unscheduled repairs and maintenance projects. Teachers 
and Administrative sta
ff forward unscheduled projects to the district maintenance department for resolution. The 
district's maintenance department prioritizes each request and assigns projects to either the school custodians or district 
maintenance staff. For urgent requests wh
en verbal communication is required, principals contact the maintenance staff 
directly. Emergency situations are given high priority and resolved immediately by school or district custodial staff, based 
upon the nature of the situation.
 
 
Pioneer Union Elem
entary School District is proud of its high standards regarding campus maintenance and general 
housekeeping practices. The Board of Trustees along with district administration has approved and adopted specific 
cleaning standards, schedules, and policies fo
r maintaining clean, safe environments for everyone on campus. The 
district's policies and standards are available for review by contacting the school principal. The custodial supervisor 
follows
-
up regularly each week to ensure custodians are following est
ablished cleaning standards and to survey campus 
facilities to identify deficiencies that should be corrected to maintain high safety and cleanliness standards. Custodians 
are provided a detailed cleaning schedule that ensures learning areas are kept clean
 
and safe throughout the school day. 
A 'Campus Pride Program' is in place with clearly established standards for shared responsibility by staff and students to 
assist in maintaining the standards.
 
 
Pioneer Elementary School's custodial staff is supervised 
by and collaborates with the district's custodial supervisor to 
ensure classrooms and campus grounds are well
-
maintained and kept safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. 
Day custodians and evening custodians are assigned to Pioneer Elementa
ry School for routine maintenance, daily custodial 
duties, and special events. The principal communicates daily with site custodians concerning safety issues, activities 
schedules, and cleaning needs. Once a week, the principal meets with the district's ma
intenance supervisor to discuss 
school facilities and safety issues, custodial responsibilities, housekeeping needs, and maintenance schedules.
 
 
Every morning before school begins, the day custodian secures the school gates and inspects school facilities f
or safety 
hazards and maintenance issues that require attention before staff and students arrive on campus. Any graffiti or signs of 
vandalism are removed immediately. Restrooms are checked at least twice a day for cleanliness and cleaned as needed. 
The da
y custodian's routine includes general maintenance duties; preparing facilities for mealtime activities; cleaning the 
cafeteria after meals are served; cleaning restrooms and classrooms; lawn and groundskeeping maintenance; and fulfilling 
basic custodial n
eeds for students and staff. The evening custodians are responsible for setting up facilities for afternoon 
meetings and special events; cleaning classrooms, library, restrooms, and office areas; and vacuuming/mopping floor 
areas. Every night, the evening 
custodians clean and disinfect every student's desk and all the bathrooms to promote a 
healthy environment and minimize germs and bacterial growth.
 
 
During the upcoming school year, Pioneer Elementary will begin the modernization project (i.e., Measure Y) 
to revitalize 
the campus with new infrastructures and the addition of new permanent classroom buildings.

Deferred Maintenance
 
Pioneer Union Elementary School District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program which provides 
dollar
-
f
or
-
dollar matching funds to assist school districts with major repairs or replacement of existing school building 
components; these typically include roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior/exterior 
painting, and floor sy
stems.
 
 
Water Well Project
 
Pioneer Elementary School recently completed a large replacement water well project, storage tank and four fire hydrants 
this year thanks to grant funding from the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund and the American 
Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act. This project began in 2005 and was completed in stages. The $2,500,000 project was completed in 2010 
and water is consistently below the federal arsenic standards of 10 parts per billion.
 
 
Public Address System
 
Pioneer Elemen
tary School utilizes a public address system throughout the school year. This system enhances campus 
safety by allowing for announcements and information to be heard throughout campus. In addition, Pioneer Elementary 
also communicates important school news
 
and announcements through our Blackboard Connect System in which 
recorded announcements call out to all parents in the school's database.
 
 
Pioneer Elementary Modernization Plan (Measure Y)
 
During the 2016
-
17 school year, a bond was passed to start the mod
ernization project at Pioneer Elementary School. This 
is a multi
-
year project. The project calls for the upgrade of two permanent buildings and the removal of all portable 
buildings and replacing them with new construction. New construction includes two ne
w wings, a K
-
2 building and 3rd/4th 
grades wing. This project will also include upgrading the infrastructure to update electrical and wireless technology so that
 
classrooms meet the requirements for the 21st Century Classroom. Modernization plans and the n
ew construction began 
in the summer of 2017 and  concluded during the 2019 summer. As of the Fall 2019 school year, phases one and two have 
been completed.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority
: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are encouraged to be 
involved in their child's learning environment by attending school events, serving on a school 
or district committees, assisting their children with homework, and by volunteering at school. Some of the opportunities 
for volunteers include becoming involved
 
with our School Site Council, PEPTC (Pioneer Elementary Parent Teacher Club), 
English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), helping out in the classroom or library, helping with the annual Book Fair 
and Santa Store, attending school events and parent confer
ences, or chaperoning field trips. Some parent involvement 
opportunities that will take place during the 2019
-
2020 school year include:  Back to School Night, Spring Open House and 
Book Fair, Parent Conferences, Fall Family Night, Grandparent's Day, Fall F
undraiser, Jog A Thon, Winter Family Fun Night, 
Santa Store, Panther Store, Family Paint Night, Winter Drive Through Dinner Fundraiser, Donuts with Dads, Muffins with 
Mom, and Awards Assemblies. These events provide wonderful experiences for the school com
munity to join together. In 
addition to school based activities, our parents are involved in a variety of ways at the district level including serving on
 
the following district committees: The District English Language Advisory Committee (DELAC), District 
Parent Advisory 
Committee (DPAC), Wellness Committee, and Title I Parent Group. These district committees offer parents the opportunity 
to have input regarding the district's LCAP Plan, our school's curriculum, and activities.
 
 
District parent committees (
e.g., DELAC, Title 1, DPAC) are essential and provide valuable input at the district level. 
Members include school site staff members, parents, site administrators, and community liaisons. Members on these 
committees review and approve district budgets, re
view current instructional materials, and review district
-
wide data for 
attendance, discipline, and academic progress. At the site level, the Pioneer Elementary School Site Council Committee's 
(SSC) purpose is to review, give input, and approve the site bu
dget and Single School Plan for Student Achievement. This 
committee meets four times a year where the school data, school budget, and the School Plan and achievement goals are 
reviewed.
 
 
The Pioneer Elementary Parent Teacher Club meets on a monthly basis a
nd has many functions. The PEPTC raises funds 
for school projects, pays for school field trips for extended learning opportunities, sponsors our Panther Pride Trips for 
3rd
-
5th grade students (incentive program for good attendance and good behavior), runs 
the Student Store for 1st
-
2nd 
students, supply Kindergarten treasure boxes in class, and helps with student and family activities.
 
 
The Wellness Committee meets several times a year and is comprised of parents, school staff members, and student 
representat
ives. The Wellness Committee members also includes representatives from student nutrition services, 
administration, health services, and physical education. Committee members are responsible for the implementation and 
update of the district's wellness poli
cies. Wellness programs are designed to increase student participation in the school 
lunch program and increase awareness about healthy eating habits and fitness. Formal lessons, classroom presentations, 
student discussions, and school
-
wide assemblies rein
force the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
 
 
Parents are kept informed of school activities, events, meeting dates, and program deadlines through weekly school 
bulletins, teacher newsletters and emails, the district's Pony Express newsletter, 
flyers, automated announcements, and 
the school's digital marquee and website. E
-
mail is available for parents who prefer a more convenient method of 
communicating with their child's teacher (e
-
mail addresses are available on the school's website). The sch
ool's web site 
hosts an internet
-
based data retrieval program that allows parents to check student grades, homework, and attendance 
(4th
-
8th); a password is required and can be obtained from the school office. Translations of any communications are 
availab
le upon request. Parents who would like more information about Pioneer Elementary School or are interested in 
participating in its learning community may contact the principal at (559) 584

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan was developed for Pioneer Elementary School in collaboration with local 
agencies and district administration 
to fulfill Senate Bill 187 requirements. Components of this plan include child abuse 
reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for 
safe arrival and departure from school, sexual haras
sment policy, and dress code policy. Pioneer Elementary's most 
current school site safety plan is reviewed, updated and shared with school staff at the beginning of each school year and 
is approved annually by the School Site Council and District School Bo
ard. Students are familiar with the emergency 
procedures and practice our action plan for fire, intruders, and earthquakes in monthly and trimester drills. The District 
and School Safety Plan is reviewed annually by the District Safety Committee as a means
 
to keep our safety protocols 
current.
 
 
The district has formed a District Safety Plan Committee. This committee meets 2
-
3 times during the school year prior to 
January to review the plan and offer input. The Safety Plan Committee ensures that the plan mee
ts state and federal 
requirements. The committee members include: local law enforcement (School Resource Officer), site teacher 
representatives, the Classified Union President, an administrator from each school site, a parent representative, the MOT 
Direct
or, local Fire Department representatives from both the city and county, as well as the district Superintendent. The 
committee keeps formal documentation for public review of the agendas and minutes.

Types of Services F
unded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
At Pioneer Elementary School we have several programs that help support struggling students and subgroups. One 
program we had is for our English Learner students. English Learners attend the EL Lab daily to receive English 
Language 
Development instruction that is individualized to meet their language proficiency level. Alternatively, the EL Instructor 
often pushes into classrooms and supports students in the classroom setting. English Learners also received language 
developm
ent instruction within their classroom with their credentialed teacher. Pioneer Elementary has supplemental 
funds that allowed us to hire Instructional Aides. Our Instructional Aides provide additional classroom support in a small 
group setting with studen
ts who were identified as academically at risk. In addition, the district has provided a summer 
jump start program for our elementary age students in grades 1st
-
3rd for the past two summers. This program takes on 
students who need extra support academicall
y in both English Language Arts and Math.Students are selected based on 
academic performance levels and English Proficiency Levels. Students are identified by performance data and are also 
referred by their credentialed teacher.  Furthermore, at Pioneer we
 
have two full
-
time and one part
-
time credentialed 
Title 1 teachers. The Title 1 staff specialized in supporting students who were identified as needing additional English 
Language Arts assistance.
