2020 School Accountability Report Card for Twinhill. In 
this document, you will find valuable information about our academic achievement, professional 
staff, curricular programs, instructional materials, safety procedures, classroom en

the condition of our facilities. The Twinhill teachers, support staff and administration work 
collaboratively to create a positive learning environment which supports the academic and 
personal growth of all our students. We focus on the Commo
n Core standards, character education, 
the use of data to drive teaching and learning, and to provide consistent implementation of the 
curriculum so we can continue to increase students' achievement and progress. Twinhill is creating 
a path of success as w

community partners to ensure the growth and success of all our students so they will realize their 
unlimited potential.
 
 
Twinhill Elementary School is located in the northwestern region 
of Riverside and serves students 
in grades transitional kindergarten through five following a traditional calendar. 
 
 
In an effort to support our students and further their success and growth, we promote a learning 
environment which supports college readin
ess for all students. As part of this endeavor, every 
classroom adopts a four year college/university. A bulletin board in every classroom is devoted to 
the adopted college/university and college vocabulary. Every Friday our students and staff proudly 
show
 
their college spirit by wearing clothing that represents their adopted college/university.
 
 
Character counts at Twinhill. We support our students' development of positive character traits 
through an emphasis on the Six Pillars of Character: Respect, Respo
nsibility, Trustworthiness, 
Fairness, Caring and Citizenship. We model these character traits in an effort to support these 
character traits in our students, so they will continue to develop decision
-
making skills that will 
serve them throughout their educ
ational careers and beyond. Our students are recognized for their 
positive character with "Caught Being Good" slips, character cash, monthly character awards and 
other incentives. Together we have made a commitment to provide the best educational program 
f
or all Twinhill students. Please let us know if you have any questions, concerns or comments 
regarding the information in this report or our school. Together with hard work and collaboration, 
our students will be challenged to realize their unlimited poten
tial.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educatio
nal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, d
ata reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.g
ov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student

Smar
ter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible
 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical
