School Description
 
Welcome to Foussat
 
Elementary School! Our entire staff is committed to providing a quality 
learning environment for all students. Our skilled and caring teachers are dedicated to meeting the 
needs of all children. Our commitment to educational excellence is at the core of o
ur instructional 
program.  We focus on providing our students with the necessary skills to be college or career 
ready.  We address these needs through the implementation of the Common Core State Standards, 
English Language Development standards and the 21s
t Century Skills of Communication, 
Collaboration, Creativity and Critical Thinking.
 
 
Foussat Elementary has a rich and challenging curriculum that develops creative, confident, and 

show compassion through acts 
of kindness at school and in the community. Our students learn teamwork and collaboration 
through partnerships modeled by staff and parents. At Foussat we take pride in our spirit of 
optimism, enthusiasm, determination, and our
 
ongoing quest for excellence.
 
 
We are proud of our DREAMS Lab (Design, Research, Engineering, Math, Science) and being able to 
offer Project Lead the Way lessons.  All students in Kinder through 5th grade rotate through the lab 
and are given the opportuni
ty to investigate real
-
world problems and design solutions.  This helps 
to foster and promote students' natural curiosity about the world around them.  To help augment 
and enrich classroom lessons, we are proud to be able to provide students with access to
 
1
-
1 
devices.   We strive daily to help our students reach their full academic potential and to instill in 
them a sense of knowing they can achieve anything they are willing to work towards. In addition to 
making sure that our student's academic needs are 
met, we also concentrate on ensuring that our 
student's social and emotional needs are also being addressed.  Foussat now has a part
-
time 
counselor who offers monthly classroom lessons to all students as well as individual and group 
sessions (grief counsel
ing, friendship issues, managing emotions, stress/anxiety and lessons on self
-
esteem).  At Foussat we believe in addressing the needs of the whole student!

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accounta
bility Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported i
n the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP,
 
see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district off
ice.

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education popula
tion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
ali
gned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

School Safety Plan
 
Foussat students follow the guiding principles of being Safe, Responsible and Respectab
le.  The 8 Keys of Excellence are also taught in the classrooms to 
help students focus on positive behavior that will guide them not only through elementary school but also through life.  As a
 
staff, we strive to provide 
all of our students with a stellar 
education and also a safe and nurturing environment where students feel safe and are able to focus on their learning.
 
 
Our school has safe and modern playground equipment, which district maintenance staff and our own custodial staff inspect reg
ularly. Play
ground 
supervisors supervise the students during all recess periods. Students follow our playground safety guidelines. In keeping wi
th the district policy, all 
visitors and volunteers are required to check
-
in at the office and obtain a visitor's badge.  Sc
hool administration oversees monthly safety drills and meets 
regularly with staff to update our School Safety Plan and address any concerns, and was last updated in October of 2019.  Our
 
clean, safe campus reflects 
our pride in our school and community.

Professional Development provided for 
Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. 
Professional learning 
opportunities are provided centrally and at the school site throughout the school year.  Staff deve
lopment is focused on the implementation of the 
Common Core Standards and the integration of the 4 Cs (Collaboration, Communication, Critical Thinking and Creativity) into d
aily lessons.  In addition 
to this, there has been an on
-
going school
-
wide focus of
 
Guided Reading in Language Arts and Math professional development.  Foussat has been a 
forerunner in the integration of technology (iPads, Apple TV, computer
-
based learning programs) in the classroom as a means of enhancing student 
learning and also as a 
way to help them learn skills they will need to be college or career ready.  This year all of the teachers at Foussat are imp
lementing 
Benchmarks English language arts program and i_Ready assessment program.   As a staff, we will be analyzing all students'
 
Guided Reading Levels and i
-
Ready test results to assess the effectiveness of the program.
