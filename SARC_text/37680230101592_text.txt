School Description
 
Anne and William Hedenkamp Elementary School opened its doors to students on September 2, 
2003. It is one of 49 District schools, including charters. It is a state
-
of
-
the
-
art school for the 21st 
century located in the southernmost county of Chula Vista on 
the east side of Interstate 805.
 
 
Hedenkamp
 
Elementary School has 40 classrooms, 12 resource rooms, a library, multipurpose 
room and an administration building. The school currently has a population of 1006 students.
 
 
Vision Statement
 
We inspire learners to excel, own their thinking, and become pos
itive forces in our global 
community.
 
 
As reflected in the Single Site Plan, goals are established to ensure that all students reach 
proficiency in all areas of CAASPP and Local Measures.   Data from site assessments in literacy skills 
and math are adminis
tered every 6
-
8 weeks to gauge student progress and drive instruction.
 
 
The Dual Language Immersion Program was established during the opening year of 2003
-
04 in 
English/Spanish. Hedenkamp offers the Dual Language Immersion Program for all grade levels, 
tr
ansitional kindergarten through sixth grade. Hedenkamp has approximately 400 students 
enrolled in Dual Language Immersion, about 40% of our population.
 
 
School
-
wide, each classroom offers a consistent, rigorous, standards aligned curriculum. Grade 
Level Te
ams collaborate for about 4 hours bimonthly to develop and implement a consistent 
standards plan in all academic areas.
 
 
As a learning community, we are working to strengthen relationships and mathematical discourse 
at all grade levels.   Another focus for
 
this school year continues to be technology and how we 
integrate technology with instruction. Each teacher now has their own laptop computer to support 
teaching and learning.  Hedenkamp now has an Interactive Promethean Board in every classroom 
to enhance
 
instruction for all students. iPads, Tablets, Desktops and/or Laptops are available for 
student use in all classrooms.  All 3
-
6 grade students have access to a device daily for creation, 
collaboration, and communication in the classroom.    In addition, H
edenkamp will continue our 
efforts to use technology to better communicate with school staff as well as to our families and the 
general Hedenkamp community.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the S

Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical

At our first SSC meeting of the year, held on August 15, 2019, one of the agenda items was to review our goals, objectives, a
nd a
ctions steps from last 
year and share the data we collected to determine whether we met our goals and/or to what extent they were met. Based on the 
data presented, new 
draft goals and objectives were shared and justified with the SSC and an opportunity for
 
questions and comments was allowed. All who have 
participated/attended SSC meetings in the past were notified of the meeting via email and provided with an agenda on August 1
2, 2019. The entire 
school community has been invited to all SSC meetings. A flye
r with all meeting dates was sent out to all parents on July 22, 2019. The flyer was also 
placed in our parent handbook which was electronically distributed via Peach Jar on July 22, 2019. The Parent Handbook was ma
de available via the 
Peach Jar link on th
e Hedenkamp School blog. There was a blog post on August 3, 2019 asking parents to get involved with the SSC and/or contact t
he 
administrators with any questions about the SSC.
 
 
Based on the input provided by SSC at the August 15 meeting and analysis of re
levant data, the Emergency Preparedness and Safety Committee drafted 
action steps for the goals and objectives. These were shared at the SSC meeting on September 10, 2019 and our ELAC meeting on
 
September 10, 2019. 
Both meetings were advertised via our sch
ool marquee beginning on September 3, 2019, there were posters posted around campus on September 8 and 
a blog post inviting people to attend the ELAC meeting was posted on September 8. Goals, objectives, and drafted action steps
 
were discussed and 
approved
 
by both committees.

In addition,  our Resource Teacher works with all teachers to provide instructional support.
  
She reflects with teachers, reviews data, models lesson, helps 
teachers target instruction, and provides professional development.
 
 
We intend to create a "cumulative effect" of instruction;  improving each year on the strategies learned and implemented i
n each grade level. Ultimately, 
students leaving our schools will have learned the necessary skills and strategies to be outstanding readers, writers, thinke
rs and mathematicians.

Our Professional Development at Hedenkamp
 
has centered around mathematical discourse, relationships and social emotional learning for learning for 
the 2019
-
2020 school year.  Our first PLC (Professional Learning Cycle) of the year focused on social emotional learning.  We provided
 
input trainings
 
for 
our teachers on GRIT.  Our teachers used read alouds and role play to develop GRIT in all our students.  Teachers visited col
league's classrooms to glean 
ideas on how to teach and instill GRIT in all our Huskies.  Our second PLC of the year focused on
 
questioning to move discourse forward.  Our teachers 
received input trainings on focusing and funneling questions.  They also received question stems at various depth of knowledg
e levels for each subject 
area.  Teachers observed colleagues to further hone
 
their questioning techniques to move students' thinking and collaborative conversations forward. 
Our third PLC is focused on mathematical discourse, specifically we want our students to further develop their ability to lis
ten attentively to their 
classmat
es and to deepen their understanding through collaborative conversations.  We will conduct a guided visit to determine our pr
ogress towards 
our quality indicators for collaborative conversations.

problem solve and design.  In addition, digital and video photography to enhance presentation skills must be requisites to en
ter seventh grade.
