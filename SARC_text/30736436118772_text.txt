By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Tustin 
Unified School District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in 
this effort, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School 
Construction (OPSC
). The results of this survey are available at the school office, the District office, or on the Internet at 
https://tinyurl.com/TUSD

Inspection
-
Tool. The District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to 
keep the school in good rep
air and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to 
ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Myford Elementary School officially opened its doors for students' first day of sch
ool on September 4th, 2001.  The 57,000 
square foot five
-
building campus includes 21 classrooms, 7 portable classrooms, and a multipurpose room.  Each of the 
28 classrooms is equipped with a SMART Board, or interactive whiteboard.  The SMART Boards provide
 
teachers and 
students with the technology needed to keep instruction engaging and interactive for students.  In addition, each 
classroom is equipped with a document camera and a sound amplification system. There is a large, grass
-
covered sports 
field that
 
serves as a hub of all athletic activities.  A Solar Panel shade structure has recently been installed over a portion 
of the field.
 
 
The facilities are maintained by one full
-
time head custodian, one full
-
time night custodian, and one part
-
time night 
cust
odian.  The Myford Elementary staff and students strive to maintain a clean and orderly learning environment and 
participate in school wide procedures which address these issues. The custodians and administration regularly assess 
school conditions, and rep
airs are performed in a timely manner.  Students are given "PAWS Pride Tickets" for taking 
responsibility for the cleanliness of the school.
 
 
Myford's annual inspection received a rating of  "good" in all categories, and an overall rating of EXEMPLARY.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced 
Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may
 
participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The 
percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There are many opportunities in the district for parental involvement through participation in parent surveys, support 
organizations, booster clubs, school site councils, DELAC and district
-
level advisory committees with the superintendent.
 
 
All Myford par
ents are provided with a multitude of opportunities to be involved at our school.  Parents are active in 
school improvement efforts through the elected School Site Council and English Language Advisory Committee.  Teachers 
give parents volunteering options
 
at the beginning of the year at their "Back to School" information night.  These volunteer 
opportunities range from helping with small groups in the classroom to assisting with the preparation of materials for 
classroom use.  Teachers are aware that some 
parents are unable to come into the classroom to devote their time, so 
many teachers give parents the opportunity to help by taking things home to prepare for the class.  Myford PTO is another 
way that interested parents can get involved.  The PTO encourag
es parents to become involved by either becoming an 
active member on the PTO Board or by volunteering time to work on or chair one of the many PTO committees that help 
to make Myford the school that we are today.  The PTO sponsors many activities throughou
t the year in which parents 
can participate (i.e. Family Nights, Book Fairs, Restaurant Nights).  Parent Workshops put on by the staff to keep parents 
informed of school activities and the curricular program.  Awards assemblies and weekly Flag Salute gathe
r parents 
together as a community to celebrate and recognize student effort and achievement.  Classroom Writing Celebrations 
include parents in celebrating students' writing.  Weekly videos highlighting "Myford Moments" are shared with parents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Date Last Reviewed by School Site Council (SSC):  February 5, 2018 (pending review February 11, 2019)
 
Date Updated and Approved by SSC:  February 5, 2018 (pending approval February 11, 2019)
 
Date Discussed with Staff: August 9, 2018
 
 
Our School Safety Plan includes the following elements: Child abuse reporting procedures, disaster procedures, routine 
and emergency (SEMS); suspension, expulsion, or mandatory expulsion recommendations; procedures to notify teachers 
of dangerous pupils; d
iscrimination/harassment policy; provisions of any school
-
wide dress code; procedures for safe 
ingress and egress; safe and orderly environment; rules and procedures on school discipline and dress code; hate crime 
reporting; school safety goals and objecti
ves. We run monthly drills and work closely with our Student Services department 
to ensure that we have updated procedures and practices in place to ensure school
-
wide safety.
 
 
The Myford staff works diligently to provide a safe environment for all 
students.  All visitors must enter through the front 
office where they sign in and receive a visitor's pass while on campus.  Myford is in year five of PBIS training, which is a 
positive behavioral intervention program that focuses on giving student positi
ve feedback for adhering to behavioral 
expectations.  Noon
-
duty supervisors are trained to work with students during lunch recess.  They are clearly identified by 
their orange safety vests, and are equipped with training in how to handle playground inciden
ts in a fair and consistent 
way.  The PTO has provided us with funding to secure emergency preparedness supplies for all students on campus.  These 
supplies are organized and housed in designated areas on campus in the event of an emergency.  School person
nel work 
closely with the Irvine Police Department to ensure that our students are safe at school, as well as on their way to and 
from school.  Staff take part in monthly fire, earthquake, and lockdown drills to prepare students in the case of an 
emergency

Tustin Unified School District provides dedicated time for professional development for all staff.  Schools often provide 
additional professional development time based on specific school
-
site scheduling and budgetary decisions.  The District 
provides inte
nsive workshops in August during the week before school starts to provide teachers with new knowledge 
and enhanced skills for the upcoming year.  Staff development opportunities are also offered after school and by release 
time throughout the school year. 
 
Additionally, professional development is provided one non
-
student day in the fall and 
one afternoon per month after school.  New teachers are provided an extensive new teacher training program throughout 
the year to support their implementation of effect
ive instruction.Teachers are given the opportunity to participate in 
Professional Development through district offerings, as well as through the school site.  Summer workshops are in place 
so that teachers can sign up to attend trainings of their choice.  
A select group of teachers participated in GATE Training, 
Readers Workshop Summer Institute, a Coaches' Readers Workshop Institute, attended a Social Thinking conference, a 
CUE Conference, and a Mindfulness Workshop.
 
 
From 2010, several teachers were selec
ted to participated in "The Art of Teaching" grant through the Cotsen Foundation 
which provided extensive professional development.  These teachers are now given further alumni opportunities to 
continue becoming more artful teachers.  All teachers are also
 
given opportunities to participate in observations and 
trainings centered around Writers Workshop, Readers Workshop, and Cognitively Guided Instruction.  All teachers 
participate in Balanced Literacy, technology, and math training throughout the school ye
ar.  Professional Development 
around the area of Balanced Literacy is strengthened through our partnership and work with Growing Educators.  This 
supports further growth in best practices.   Additional professional development opportunities throughout the 
school year 
are determined by teacher surveys in conjunction with assessment data.  On selected Wednesdays each month, time is 
allotted for teachers to participate in these learning opportunities to promote professional growth.  In addition, teachers 
are e
ngaged in grade level Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) every week.
