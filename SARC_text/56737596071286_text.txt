By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Westlake Elementary is a welcoming, vibrant and collaborative community that focuses on a well
-
rounded education. 
Westlake Elementary's mission is to provide students a fun and challenging 
curriculum in a nurturing and supportive 
environment. Our school promotes inclusivity, integrity, and empathy through a variety of social
-
emotional and character 
education programs. Westlake is committed to providing students with a rigorous and well
-
round
ed education. Westlake 
Elementary's curriculum focuses on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) including the Next Generation Science 
Standards (NGSS). Throughout the year, students receive an extensive specialist schedule and have a variety of 
opportunities 
available to them including: enrichment, intervention, leadership, arts, and technology.
 
 
Westlake Elementary incorporates a well
-
developed Multi
-
tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) program and targeted time 
for English Language Development (ELD) instruction.
 
Our MTSS program is called MAGIC (Meeting Academic Goals In 
Curriculum) time, and provides intervention and enrichment for all students in English Language Arts. Every student 
receives small group instruction at their level with curricular focuses in phon
ics skills, fluency, comprehension, text 
analysis, and research and inquiry. Additional credentialed teachers are provided during each grade level's MAGIC time, 
to allow for significantly reduced class size. Our classroom and additional support teachers wo
rk together to provide 
explicit instruction in each group's target area. This year, we provided an additional support teacher to further reduce 
group numbers. We hope this will result in a continued increase in academic achievement for all of our students,
 
including 
English learners (EL), students with disabilities (SWD), and socio
-
economically disadvantaged students (SED). Our targeted 
time for English Language Development occurs during our eBlock (enrichment block) time. During this time, English 
learners
 
(EL) receive targeted instruction in English language development. This year, all EL students are receiving the pilot 
ELD curriculum, which pairs with the ELA (English Language Arts) curriculum and will hopefully increase relevance and 
engagement. Additio
nal enrichment options are available to students during eBlock including targeted options for our 
GATE (Gifted and Talented) students including school newspaper, stocks, videography, entrepreneurial skills, and science.
 
 
Westlake Elementary has been very i
ntentional in efforts to provide a more inclusive environment and community for all 
students including students with disabilities (SWD) and socio
-
economically disadvantaged (SED) students. Activities to 
foster this inclusive climate have been planned throu
ghout the year including Start with Hello week, Anti
-
bullying month, 
Inclusive Schools week, Kindness month, along with our school motto, "Be The Nice Kid," being reinforced on a weekly 
basis. This year, we implemented a new student leadership opportunity 
for our 4th and 5th grade students called WOW 
(Welcoming Our Wizards), of which SWD and SED are represented. WOW's mission is to create an educational 
environment where students are empowered to foster an inclusive environment and are equipped to reach out
 
to other 
students on campus to ensure that everyone feels safe and included. WOW leaders visit classrooms monthly, provide 
recess activities for students, are buddies for new students, and act as a cadre to identify bullying behavior and help to 
stop it. 
 
To promote inclusivity and access within the classroom, Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is a school focus. 
Teachers are receiving professional development in UDL throughout the school year. This focus will continue to enhance 
the inclusion efforts of 
our staff and our efficacy in providing all students access to the curriculum. Additional enrichment 
opportunities are available through our extensive specialist schedule.  Westlake Elementary students receive music 
instruction (all grades), ballroom dance
 
(grade 1 and 4), technology instruction (all grades), and Art Masters (grades 1
-
5). 
Students also have the opportunity to participate in the band and strings program during the school day and our chorus 
program after school. Westlake Elementary's Makerspa
ce room is a space for students to grow in creativity, collaboration, 
and problem solving through STEAM technologies including robotics, crafting, coding, video and movie making technology, 
3D printing, and engineering. iPads and Chromebooks are available 
to all students with one

through 5th grade.  Additional student leadership opportunities include: Student Council
-
 
an active student body that has 
monthly activities and promotes school spirit, WOW (Welcoming Our Wizards) team
-
 
focusing on inclusivity and belonging, 
and our student Tech Team
-
 
leading all technology aspects of the school including videoing and reporting of school events, 
running the sound and light boards for school plays and musicals, and assisting with technolo
gy needs.
 
 
Our dedicated and active parent community supports our school in every way from supplemental and instructional 
supports to events and activities. Many of our events are designed to engage families and create a more cohesive home 
and school conne
ction. Some of our events include: Back
-

nights, Bingo Night, Math Night, Science Night, storytelling, talent show, and the American Fair. Our PFA also provides 
assemblies which this year inclu

Elementary recognizes the uniqueness of each child and is committed to providing a well
-
rounded educational program.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
January 2020
 
 
All TK
-
12 students have current standards
-
based textbooks in math, science, history/social science, and English/language 
arts. With each curricular cycle established by the State of Calif
ornia, the Conejo Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) 
Board of Education adopts textbooks within the timeline provided. Standards
-
aligned books for grades 9
-
12 are approved 
locally. Textbooks in grades K
-
8 are selected from lists of books and materials 
approved by the State Board of Education. 
Sufficient standards
-
based textbooks and instructional materials have been purchased for all students in English, math, 
history/social science, science, health and foreign language. In addition, annually, sites rec
eive specific science 
supplementary funds to be used for consumable laboratory expenses and/or equipment.
 
 
The process of selecting textbooks and materials involves the formation of a committee charged with the responsibility of 
reviewing current state sta
ndards and frameworks, analyzing student data, writing courses of study (as required) and 
selecting and maintaining current instructional materials. The goal of such district
-
wide committees comprised of teachers 
and administrators representing all targete
d grade levels, is to achieve high academic standards for all of our TK
-
12 
students. Each major subject area, such as math, science, history/social science, foreign language and English/language 
arts, is reviewed and adopted under the guidance of the Calif
ornia Department of Education and State Board of Education. 
The committee submits its recommendations to the Board of Education for final approval. The recommendation to the 
Board includes the basic textbook materials as well as supplementary materials wit
hin the subject. On October 1, 2019, 
the CVUSD Board of Education approved a resolution for the 2019
-
2020 school year declaring that the Conejo Valley 
Unified School District has provided each pupil with sufficient standards
-
based textbooks and instruction
al materials 
consistent with the cycles and content of the curriculum frameworks.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Each fall, all schools in the Conejo Valley Unified School District are inspected by a team which consists of all or many of 
the following personnel:   Site Admi
nistrator, Director of Maintenance and Operations, Director of Planning and New 
Construction, and the Assistant Superintendent. A facilities evaluation is completed documenting the condition of the 
school in a variety of area  including the cleanliness of 
restrooms, condition of roofs, paving and walkways, HVAC systems,

the funds available to address those needs.  The final list is approved by the Board of Education in the Spring, with the 
majority of projects completed the following Summer.  Each year the District participates in the St

Maintenance Program and these funds have been a major source of support for the annual Major Projects List in recent 
years   The District revises and submits a Five
-
Year Deferred Maintenance Plan to the Office of Public School Construction 
(
OPSC).  The District has not been required to make its normal contribution to the Deferred Maintenance Fund since the 
2008

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP]
 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight
 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant co
gnitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or program
s 
of study.

Westlake Elementary has an active Parent Faculty Association (PFA), School Site Council (SSC), Gate Committee, and 
English Language Advisory Council (ELAC).  These leadership bodies help set the goals of the school and actively work to 
increase parent invo
lvement on campus.  SSC and ELAC oversee the creation, implementation, and evaluation of Westlake 

-
scheduled meetings, all of which are open to the public. Parents have many 
involvement opportunities and representati
on through School Site Council (SSC), Gate Committee, and our English 
Language Advisory Council (ELAC) along with Parent Education classes facilitated by our Outreach Assistant and 
community partnerships, and our Parent Faculty Association (PFA). Parents a
re also encouraged to volunteer at school 
and attend any of our events. Our Special Education District Advisory Council (SEDAC) representatives offer involvement 

atives participate in 
district
-
level meetings and report back to SSC and ELAC, enriching our district
-
site level communication. The school 
leadership team (LCAP) team meet regularly to identify and address student needs and necessary supports for teachers 
for delivering quality instruction for all students, as well as Tier 2 supports for students in targeted populations (EL, SPE
D 
and SED). Our focus this year is on UDL strategies in the classroom.
 
 
To volunteer, please contact Megan Triplett, the Principal,
