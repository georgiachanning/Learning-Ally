About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pu

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter
 
Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible st
udents 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter

Based on the 
analysis of CAASPP data as well as local assessments the district continues to deliver research based Developmental Reading A
ssessment 
(DRA) as well as a guided reading program intended to differentiate instruction and meet the needs of each individual stu
dent, especially our EL 

sed writing program that 
allows teachers and instructional aides to work on the individual needs of each ch
ild.  Professional Development is delivered by consultants, in the area 
of mathematics, during our early release days, by attending workshops, or during the regular school day by providing substitu
tes for classroom teachers.  
The district is implementing a
 
data driven tiered reading as well as language intervention program to target struggling English learners, and accelerate 
their learning to meet grade level expectations.  Teachers are supported through follow up meetings with administration to di
scuss st
udent work analysis, 
district and classroom assessment data protocol, and grade level meetings to determine intervention and next level work for s
tudents who are struggling 
and excelling.
