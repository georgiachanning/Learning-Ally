By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Tamura School. Students are supervised before/after school, during 
lunch and recess periods, by teachers, administrators, trained aides, and classified staff. All visitors to the campus mu
st 

Tamura must check
-
in and check
-
out through the Raptor Visitor Management System which helps to ensure an elevated 
level of securi
ty for the school.
 
 
 
The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake 
standards. The Safety Committee reviews and updates the Safe School Action Plan each year by March 1st. Any and al
l 
revisions to the plan are immediately communicated to classified and certificated staff.
 
 
The Goals and Objectives in the Safe School Action Plan focus on three areas:
 
1)  A school climate characterized by caring and connectedness,
 
2)  The safe and orderly physical environment of the school, and
 
3)  The health and wellness of students.
 
 
To supplement the Safe School Action Plan, every school also has a disaster preparedness plan that includes steps for 
ensuring student and staff safe
ty during a disaster. Fire, disaster, and lockdown drills are conducted on a rotating basis 
throughout the school year.  Tamura staff participated in professional development related to safety during the 2019
-
20 
school year.
