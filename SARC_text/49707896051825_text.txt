About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to 
publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to pre
pare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consis
tent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more informatio
n about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school prin
cipal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Kenwood Elementary School consists of the 
original building constructed in 1960, the multi purpose building constructed in 1987, and four portable 
classrooms. The original main building houses kindergarten through third grade, a computer lab, a library, and the school/dis
trict office. The multi pu
rpose 

portable buildings house the 
sixth grade classroom, the Resource Specialist, as well as the Creativity Room where art and mus
ic classes are held and a classroom designated to STEAM 
instruction. In addition, Kenwood School has a preschool and day care program on site in two more portable classrooms. The po
rtable classroom that 
houses the day care program was be replaced in the su
mmer of 2019 with a new building as well as an updated path of entry from the front of the school. 
Also part of the project was the addition of two large water tanks that will serve as an emergency fire suppression water sup
ply for the the school and 
neigh
boring community.
 
 
Kenwood School utilizes a campus safety team consisting of the Superintendent/Principal, a parent member of the School Site C
ouncil, and the Facilities 
Coordinator. The Facilities Coordinator provides a report to the School Site Council 
at each meeting. Kenwood School prides itself on the safety and 
cleanliness of the entire campus. The district employs two custodians who clean the facility on a daily basis. All classrooms
 
meet state requirements for 
space. The restrooms, electrical syste
m, and plumbing are checked on a daily basis. The District continues to contribute funds to the State School Deferred 
Maintenance Program which helps the school with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building comp
onents. Typic
ally, this 
includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. 
For the 2018
-
19 school year, the 
District budgeted $7,200 for the Deferred Maintenance Program. This represents 0.2% of 

installation was completed in 2016 and was funded in part by the Proposition 39 Clean Energy Jobs Act.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priorit

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessme
nts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards,
 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the 
University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical
