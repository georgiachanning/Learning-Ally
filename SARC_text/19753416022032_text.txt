Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The Redondo Beach Unified School District is focusing staff professional development (PD) in three main areas: effective 
instructional strategies aligned to California State Standards at schools sites; use of technology in 
instruction; and the 
supporting of the social, emotional, and behavioral needs of all students, particularly through the implementation of 
Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS) in all schools. While the current PD does focus on instructional
 
and 
curriculum in mathematics, English, and science, the RBUSD is also developing PD for History Social Science standards.
 
 
The RBUSD is engaged in a multi
-
layered approach to delivering PD. The District provides PD through: teacher release 
time; conferen
ce attendance; one
-
day workshops; mentoring; book studies; and after
-

elementary schools utilize weekly collaborative planning time through the implementation of a School Instructional 
Leadership Team and grade level leads.
 
 
Ta
rgeted teacher development activities are essential for increasing the quality of education to students. The below topics 
are a few of the professional development areas for this school year:
 

 
Reading strategies and understanding text complexity
 

 
MTSS and Ti
er 2 Intervention Strategies
 

 
Supporting students with disabilities through inclusive practices and co
-
teaching
 

 
Grade level articulation
 

 
Professional Learning Communities (PLCs)
 

 
Student mental health
 

 
Suicide prevention
 

 
Mastery Learning
 

 
Examination of student assessment results
 
The use of student data is critical to better assess and support individual student development. The District provides 
training on our student data management, Performance Matters, to analyze individual and aggrega
te student progress. 
Elementary teachers and secondary math teachers receive ongoing training and support on diagnosing students learning 
targets and adjusting instruction to increase number sense.
 
 
Internal PD offerings are supplemented by partnering with
 
external professional development organizations, including 

teachers and administration on instructional programs for all students.
 
 
Our new tea
chers are supported at school sites and at the District level through the Beginning Teacher Support and 
Assessments (BTSA) Program where each new teacher is mentored by a BTSA support provider. By working with BTSA, a 
new teacher receives support and resou
rces to improve their teaching pedagogy.
 
 
Through the collective bargaining process, additional paid professional development days are included in the teacher work 
calendar.
