School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stude
nt Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics
 
given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
s
tudents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tech
nical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Cecil Avenue Math and Science Academy offers a variety of opportunities for parents to be involved with their students 
on and off campus. We have a School Site Council and English Language Learner Advisory Council that meet at least six 
times a year.  Pare
nts are encouraged to attend and participate in discussions involving curriculum, instruction, parent 
involvement, etc. We also hold an annual Back to School Night at the beginning of the year and parent
-
teacher conferences 
during Trimesters One and Two fo
r parents to have an opportunity to meet one
-
on
-
one with teachers about their child's 
academic process. Parents also have access to view their child's grades through the online Aeries Parent Portal. This gives 
parents the opportunity to see their child's g
rades in real time. Teachers are encouraged to update their gradebooks every 
two weeks so parents have the opportunity to view their child's progress and setup teacher conferences as needed. In 
addition we also invite our parents to participate in nonacade
mic activities such as parent luncheons, awards assemblies, 
movie nights, paint nights, and parent educational nights.  With the various events happening throughout the school year, 
Cecil Avenue utilizes several resources and methods for inviting parents a
nd reminding them about school functions such 
as the school's website and Facebook pages, Blackboard Connect (computer
-
generated phone calls) and fliers.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Student safety is a priority. Cecil Avenue employs a full time campus supervisor who patrols the school grounds before, 

time School Resource Officer (SRO) 
who visits the campus almost daily and is available for specific situations when necessary.  Administration, classroom 
teachers, and noon
-
duty aides supervise breaks, passing periods, lunches, and end of the day dismissal
.  Detailed steps for 
staff to follow for all emergency situations are also included in the safety plan, and safety drills are reviewed and practic
ed 
with staff and students at least once per trimester.
 
 
Continual improvement of school climate is also a fo
cus of Cecil Avenue with the incorporation of our Multi
-
Tiered Systems 
of Supports (MTSS) which include positive behavior recognition, counseling, and behavior intervention to name a few.  
The site has an MTSS team that meet at least twice a month to analy
ze discipline data and create professional 
development for staff regarding classroom environment.  In addition, Cecil Avenue acquired a behavior intervention 
teacher who meets with Tier 2 students throughout the week to provide behavior intervention using 
the Why Try program, 
Ripples Effects, and other behavior
-
specific lessons.  Cecil Avenue also acquired a social worker who is present on campus 
each day. The plan will be reviewed, updated, and discussed with school faculty by December 16, 2019.

Our ASES (or POWER) after school program serves approximately 90 students daily with enrichment and intervention 
activities in English language arts. In addition, our After School STARS Academy Intervention program serves approximately 
multiple students fo
ur times a week for 4 weeks at a time. This program helps students focus on  master fundamental 
mathematical operations or instilling skills for Language Development. We also have an academic math coach, and one 
academic learning Coordinator.  This year, C
AMSA is partnering up with Project Lead the Way, PLTW, to create a 
automation and robotics program for our 6th 
-
 
8th grade students. This program will help the students become better 
acquainted with modern robotics and coding which gives them the opportuni
ty to enroll at Bakersfield College to further 
pursue a degree in robotics while enrolled in high school. Lastly, part of our charter plan includes having an accelerated 
program in math and science which includes a class of 8th graders who are enrolled in 
an Algebra course at Delano High 
School. Upon satisfactorily completing the course, they will receive Algebra 1 credit before entering high school.

During the 2016
-
2017 and 2017
-
2018 school year, 10 days were dedicated to staff development where the primary focus 
has been on English Language Development and Mathematical Practices. The site SBAC data was used to make these 
determinations.  The methods 
of professional development used have been school workshops, conference attendance, 
and co
-
teaching with site academic coach. Teachers also receive feedback and are supported by school and district 
administration as well as from academic coaches through cl
assroom walk
-
throughs and through structured teacher 
planning sessions.
 
 
For the 2019
-
2020 school year, Cecil Avenue Math and Science Academy decided to allocate a minimum of 10 professional 
development days. So far the site has had 4 whole staff and appro
ximately 6 content/grade level based professional 
development day.
 
 
Staff development and areas of focus are based off of our SBAC data and the newly adopted ELPAC data. Early in the year, 
departments meet with campus administrators and resource support st
aff to disaggregate data and find trends and 
patterns that are affect our students.  Teachers are provided with structured teacher planning time (STPT) during the day 
to discuss factors that determine student scores. Based on these data
-
driven discussions,
 
teachers then formulate goals 
to address the needs of our students. Campus administrators along with resource support staff assist in guiding teachers 
into the creation of their action
-
plan to meet their data
-
driven goals. Two areas of focus for this year
 
were Listening and 
Writing for English Language Arts and Concepts and Procedures for Math. These areas also demonstrated that two special 
population groups needed an extra added focus: special education students and English
-
Learners.
 
 
Methods of delivery 
for professional development come in an array of forms. This year, after
-
school professional 
development began with a co
-
teaching to address the concerns of our special education population. An initial 
informational meeting where campus administrators shar
ed the reason behind co
-
teaching and how it would be 
implemented. A follow
-
up meeting took place soon after but this time the conference was an STPT day held in a district 
conference room where we illicit ed the support of our special education director. S
ubsequently, teachers needed follow
-
up support and more so in the area of individual mentoring by one of our campus administrators or by a district coach. In 
addition, support for our English Learners was addressed with our teachers by providing coaching f
rom our district ELA 
coach and campus administrators. Furthermore, in the area of Math, our teachers met with our resource support staff to 
have an initial meeting and then began to have a series of follow
-
up meetings where areas of concern were discussed.
 
Presently, teachers have been reviewing SBAC interim assessments to help provide instructional guidance and mentoring 
to our teachers in the areas of both math and English.
 
 
Teachers continue to be supported through in
-
class coaching from district coaches
, resource support staff and campus 
administrators. In addition, we monitor student progress and make adjustments when needed.
