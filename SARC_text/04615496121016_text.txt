By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our vision for Heritage Community Day School is for all students t
o develop a strong foundation in academics and to 
develop socialization skills enabling them to be successful in the school community, the community at large and the work 
force. We focus on a respectful and safe learning environment. We strive to promote s
tudents that will become 
productive, employed and socially responsible, self
-
motivated citizens. Our daily mission at Heritage CDS is to prepare our 
students, academically and socially, for success in their next educational setting whether that is the comp
rehensive middle 
school or high school.
 
 
School Description 

 
Our attendance fluctuates to meet the needs of the comprehensive school sites in our district and to 
honor agreements with our neighboring school districts. There are typically between 10
-
15 stu
dents in grades 6, 7 and 8 
and they come from a variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The faculty and support staff are progressive minded, 
implementing innovative ideas and proven methods with students. It is a pleasure to serve the families in our 
community.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Our Community Day School is a newer facility that is inspe
cted and maintained annually. Heritage works diligently to 
ensure that our campus is clean, safe, and functional. District maintenance staff and site custodial staff ensure that the 
repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order 
process is used to ensure efficient service and that safety
-
related repairs are given the highest priority. The principal works 
closely with the custodial staff to ensure that all school facilities are kept clean 
and free of safety hazards. Currently the 
restroom tile floors need re
-
grouting and sealing.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Because we are such a small 
school, the classroom aide, the teacher, the counselor and the principal are able to interact 
with families on a daily basis. There are several opportunities that exist for interested parents/guardians to become 
involved in our school. Parents are solicite
d each year with inquiries as to how they and other family members might like 
to be involved.
 
 
Parents are invited to serve on our Nelson Avenue Middle School Site Council, and we solicit their assistance with revision 
of the School Plan for Student Achiev
ement, our Parent Involvement Policy and our Family
-
School Compact. Parents also 
attend Back to School Night, Open House and Parent Conferences.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Heritage Community Day School takes a serious position when it comes to school safety. The school safety plan was 
developed with input from teachers, staff, and parents with a goal of 
making the school safer for our students and 
community. The plan provides a comprehensive plan on various safety issues that affect the school.
 
 
The plan addresses the dress code, certain policies pertaining to harassment, emergencies, and safe egress on a
nd off the 
campus. Survey data is gathered to assist in the action plan of the safety plan to ensure we are meeting the needs targeted 
for our school. It is reviewed annually with changes made toward improvement via teachers, students, and the School Site 
Council. The completed plan is sent to the board of trustees for approval every year. The plan is available at the site and 
can be checked out to any parent wishing to review it or provide input. Our goal is to ensure that our school is a safe place
 
for st
udents to develop academically and socially.
 
 
The Thermalito Union Elementary School District has a district
-
wide comprehensive School Safety Plan that is updated 
annually, pursuant to Education Code 32280
-
32289. Our vision is to empower all stakeholders i
n order to create a safe 
and challenging environment where all students and staff can be safe and grow academically, socially and emotionally. 
We will provide an environment which allows for the development of attitudes that promote healthful physical, soc
ial, 
academic and mental habits. This will be accomplished by encouraging pride in self achievement, respect and 
responsibility toward self and others, recognition of students and staff and positive relationships with young people.

This section provides information on the annual number of school days dedicated to staff development for the recent

year period.
 
 
Heritage CDS teachers are afforded professional development 
opportunities similar to those offered to general education 
teachers in the Thermalito Union Elementary School District. In the last three years, teachers participated in district
-
wide 
grade level collaboration, Trauma Responsive schools training, Nurtured
 
Heart, Brain
-
based Research, English Language 
Development (ELD) and New State Standards training in English Language Arts and Math. CDS teachers received training 
in Crisis Prevention Intervention (CPI) and a seminar regarding Oppositional Defiance Disord
er (ODD).  Staff will also be 
working with a consultant to assist the district in professional learning communities (PLC's). In addition, teachers have 
ongoing training on the ELA/ELD Study Sync program.
 
 
Once a week, collaboration time with colleagues at 
the comprehensive school sites is also made available.
