School Description
 
Edmondson Elementary is the 
proud home of the mighty eagles, where we offer a rigorous and 
highly academic curriculum along with social emotional learning, to prepare our students (the 
whole child) for a successful future as a life
-
long learner. 
 
All of our teachers are AVID trained,
 
enhancing our instruction using WICOR across all content areas, in alignment with our district's 
focus areas of literacy, math, and college & career readiness. 
 
We are also proud to be one of only 
two elementary schools within Norwalk
-
La Mirada Unified Sc
hool District that offers a specialized 
Dual Language Immersion Program. Our DLI program promotes students who are fully bi
-
literate in 
English and Spanish. All of our teachers are highly qualified. Our instructors utilize the 90
-
10 model. 
Our students sta
rt in Kinder, receiving 90 percent of instruction in Spanish and 10 percent of 
instruction in English. By fifth grade the instruction is 50
-
50, both English and Spanish. 
 
Starting a 
student's educational journey as early as possible has proven to be fruitf
ul years later when a child 
enters high school and college so we added a Transitional Kinder classroom. 
 
Our TK students 
attend school all day, with the help of a para
-
educator and a highly qualified teacher.
 
 
 
We believe in the power of Collaborative Coll
ective Efficacy. 
 
Our grade
-
level teams engage in 
weekly professional learning communities (PLCs) to use the cycle of inquiry to monitor students' 
academic progress in service of student achievement. 
 
We have several teacher teams and support 
staff that he
lp to build capacity across our school. 
 
We have a Site Leadership Team/AVID Site Team, 
who receive district training and assist the Principal with planning and facilitation of professional 
development sessions for teachers and staff. 
 
We have an English L
earner Team, who also receive 
district training that is then shared with all staff during professional development sessions to 
improve our efforts in meeting our English Learner needs. 
 
We have a District Teacher
-
on
-
Special
-
Assignment who works with our st
aff to provide research
-
based professional development and 
support around interventions, organize our Response To Intervention (or RTI), and host CAPSS/SST 
meetings. 
 
This staff member is part of our Site Intervention Team, which also includes a general 
ed
ucation teacher, our SPED Resource Specialist (RSP) teacher, our Speech teacher, our Student 
Support Specialist (ESSS), and administrator. 
 
A feature that also makes our school special was the 
hiring of four Reading/Math tutors to help support our teachers
 
during our intervention time for 
all grades, TK 
-
 
5th. 
 
Based on student need, we provide intervention in both English and Spanish, 
adding a bilingual component to our previous RTI intervention program.
 
 
Technology is the key to our students' future. Ther
efore, we hired a full
-
time Media Tech. to 

iReady and Accelerated Reader (English & Spanish), iStation for K
-
2, Notability, and Coding & 
Robotics. On top of tha
t we created two computer labs
---
 
a Mac lab full of iMacs and Mac Minis, as 
well as a PC
-
based lab with Dell computers. 
 
In addition, we have added a TK
-
5 music program as 
well as a visual arts program called "Meet The Masters."

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year
, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local prioritie
s. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expul

Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Our supervision staff monitor and keep our school safe beginning 35 minutes before school, and after school as well. During r
ecess and lunch we also 
maintain a full staff fr
om the cafeteria to the playground. Teachers regularly review the rules for safe, responsible behavior in school and on the 
playground. We have a safe and closed campus during the core instructional day from 8:00 a.m. to 2:22 p.m. Visitors must ente
r the s
chool through the 
front office and sign
-
in, where they receive a visitor's badge to wear throughout their stay.
 
 
We revise our School Safety Plan annually. The plan includes procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and inventories of emer
gency 
supplies. We make 
the plan available and keep copies in the office for parents. We share the plan with all staff during a school wide staff mee
ting. Our staff practices routine 
fire, earthquake, and emergency drills every month. We also host trainings for 
staff on emergency preparedness.
 
 
Our safety plan includes two staging areas to ensure that, in case of emergency, students are picked up in an orderly fashion
. Every classroom has 
emergency supplies. Our PTA also assists our school in procuring a 30
-
gallo
n can full of emergency food supplies, water, and activities for every classroom. 
In one of our staging areas we also have a large storage container full of major emergency supplies such as helmets, blankets
, axe, stretcher/cot, and 
water.
