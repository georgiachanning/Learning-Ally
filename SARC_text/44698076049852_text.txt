By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
San Lorenzo Valley Elementary School is a two
-
time C
alifornia Distinguished school and a California Gold Ribbon School. 
Our mission statement is as follows: We are a community of dedicated educators supporting one another to develop 
critical thinkers and inspire confident learners. We are committed to makin
g a difference in the lives of children through 
teaching innovative programs, engaging curriculum, active communication and essential interventions.  Our vision is to 
build and sustain innovative programs, engaging curriculum and essential interventions th
at support continuous 
improvement in student achievement.
 
 
San Lorenzo Valley Elementary is one of 2 elementary schools in the San Lorenzo Valley Unified School District.  We are 
located in the heart of the Santa Cruz Mountains and have been an integral pa
rt of the Valley for the past 60 years.  We 
are now in our third generation of students.  At the beginning of the 06
-
07 school year, San Lorenzo Valley Elementary 
School became a K
-
5 school.  In 2012, we added a TK program. Our school now includes 562 stud
ents. Our K
-
3 students 
participate in class size reduction, with those classrooms averaging about 23 students.  4th and 5th grade classes average 
about 30 students. All classrooms are equipped with projectors, document cameras, and computers, and we have a
 
Mac 
computer lab and Chromebook carts that are used by all classes.  5th grade students are participating in a "Bring Your 
Own Device
--
BYOD" program to ensure access to technology and a focus on 21st Century Learning Skills.
 
 
Curriculum is focused on prep
aring students for college and career in all subject areas, and follows the Common Core 
Standards for each grade level.  Our teachers engage in regular collaboration around student achievement on Wednesday 
afternoons. K
-
3 students have music enrichment, sc
ience enrichment and art added into the curriculum because we value 

-
grade students have separate teachers for Music and Science, in 
addition to art instruction.  In addition, all students have PE i
nstruction. SLVE students benefit greatly from our location.   
The school shares a large campus with the district's middle and senior high schools. This proximity allows for many cross
-
age tutoring opportunities, with MS and HS students acting as tutors an
d classroom aides for our classes.  Students also 
gain hands
-
on learning in our environment through hands
-
on lessons using the redwood forest and our local watershed 
for nature walks, experiments, and lessons in conservation.
 
 
Please visit our school or we
bsite to hear about all of the excitement that is happening at SLVE.
 
 
SLVE is the place to be!

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
October, 2019
 
 
San Lorenzo Valley Unified held a 
public hearing on October 17, 2019, and determined that each school within the district 
had sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment Pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All stu
dents, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned 
textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home, Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted in a cycle alig
ned  with  the California Department of Education, making the 
textbooks used in the school always either current or under new adoption processes. We are currently piloting a NGSS 
aligned science program (FOSS) and considering it for adoption for this upcom
ing school year.  Materials approved for use 
by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee 
composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent exa
mination at the district 
office prior to adoption. The table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education populati
on and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the re
quirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

categorical budgets and approves
 
SPSA, or the Bobcat Club, our parent group, which provides funds to supplement our 
programs. In addition, parents volunteer in classrooms, drive on field trips, provide our Art Masterpiece program, and 
assist in a number of other ways.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of San Lorenzo Valley Unified. Schools in the 
district are in compliance 
with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. Each site works 
with the district and county to ensure that there is a Safety Plan at each site.  During the fall semester of
 
the new school 
year, all annual revisions were communicated to both the classified and certificated staff. The school's disaster 
preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are 
conduct
ed on a regular basis throughout the school year. Lockdown drills are held annually.

SLVUSD is committed to "leading the 
learning" and provides multiple opportunities for professional development 
throughout the year.  We believe that the best professional development occurs when educators spend significant time 
collaborating around four essential questions:
 
1. What do we wan
t all students to learn?
 
2. How do we know if students learned?
 

 
4. How do we systematically respond when students already know the learning goals?
 
Because we have aligned our vision on professi
onal learning, SLVUSD teachers and staff meet for an hour each week for 
grade level and/or department collaboration.   Educators analyze the results from student work and then determine 
instruction that will best meet the needs and strengths of students.  
Sites use collaboration time to focus on their own 
professional learning as well.  Each site has a focus area for instructional improvement that is developed with the 
administrator and presented in the site plan and in teacher/administrator goals.
 
Througho
ut the year, the district also provides professional development in a variety of avenues.  Administrators meet 
regularly as an Administrative Council to learn with their colleagues about collaboration, instructional strategies and 
research and leadership. 
 
Teacher leaders participate in district teams that focus on technology, instructional strategies, 
assessment, mathematics, English learners, gifted education and other key issues that improve classroom and school
-
wide 
learning for all students. SLVUSD sta
ff participates in professional development days at the beginning of the school year 
and  throughout the school year.
 
 
For 2019
-
2020, the PD focus for our district began with Design Thinking as a model for collaborative problem solving. We 
continued our SE
L focus with Healthy Kids survey data analysis and planning next steps. Our content focus PD is centered 
around mathematics this year with 2 full days of professional development provided by Dr. Nicki Newton. With her 
support, we are diving into the Math W
orkshop model as an instructional strategy to differentiate instruction and support 
all of our students as they work toward proficiency and beyond. In addition, We are continuing to provide PD in Readers 
and Writers Workshop with Momentum's PD offerings.
 
 
For 2018
-
2019, the PD focus for our district continues the theme of Social Emotional Learning (SEL) and student 
engagement. The district started the year with two PD days (August 15 and 16), bringing in outside experts in engaging 
and connecting with stude
nts. The PD day on October 19th continued this theme, and also added in work on the Next 
Generation Science Standards for elementary. The last PD day of the year, February 1, 2019, will focus on more NGSS 
work, student engagement and interdisciplinary team
ing.
 
 
For 2017
-
2018 the PD focus for our four district PD days was social and emotional learning (SEL). We had two days in 
August focused around this theme (August 22 and August 23, 2017, and we had two more during the year on January 26, 
2018 and March 12
, 2018). These days allowed for professional speakers to come in and share resources and best practices 
with teachers, and we also build in time for collaboration and planning. We also held some after school sessions on SEL to 
support further PD for teache
rs.
 
 
Another PD focus for 17
-
18 was reviewing grading and homework practices. Our District Curriculum Council (DCC) 
reviewed these issues and made plans for revising policy and practice. The DCC meetings are held during the school day, 
so teachers do have 
release time for these sessions. DCC is made up of administrators and teacher leaders.
 
 
PD Days in 15
-
16: 8/18/15, 8/19/15, 10/30/15, 1/29/16: Focus area was Writer's Workshop, CGI Math, AVID and data 
driven instruction.
 
 
PD Days in 16
-
17: 8/16/16, 
8/17/16, 10/10/16, 1/27/17: Focus area was instructional technology and data driven 
instruction.
 
 
Last we have district coaches who support our teachers in our areas of focus. Our two coaches this year are focused on 
SEL and data/assessment (PLCs, benchmar
k assessments, reviewing data, etc.). These coaches support teachers in and out 
of the classroom.
