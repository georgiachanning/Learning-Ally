Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The safety of students and staff is of utmost importance to Jefferson Elementary School. Supervision is provided to ensure 
student safety on school grounds before, during, and after school. School entrances are secured or monitored during 
school hours and 
visitors report to the office first. Emergency and evacuation procedures are posted across the campus 
and practiced monthly. 
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan, developed by the school in partnership with the School Site Council (SSC), provides 
additio
nal information regarding maintaining a safe environment and preparing for emergencies. The plan is revised and 
approved by the school board each year. It was last reviewed/updated in January 29, 2019 and discussed with staff at that 
time. It was reviewed 
again August 2019 for new staff.
 
 
Key elements of the plan include:
 

 
The LUSD discipline matrix
 

 
LUSD district policies and procedures including but not limited to: Child Abuse Reporting, Disaster and 
Emergency Response Procedures, Bullying, Hate Crime 
reporting, Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports 
(PBIS)
 

 
Results from the California Healthy Kids Survey
