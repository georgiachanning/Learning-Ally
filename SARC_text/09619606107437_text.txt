Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

areas provide basketball, volleyball, and 
other hard surface activities. A turf field provides additional PE activities and lunch 
time play. Boys and girls restrooms are located on the upper and lower classroom levels. Restroom facilities for staff are 
located near the front office. Classrooms, re
strooms, multipurpose room, and office areas are cleaned and maintained on 
a daily basis. The campus is free of graffiti. An active recycling program is ongoing to help reduce trash and instill 
conservation behaviors in our students.
 
 
The school is well ma
intained and safe. Policies are in place regarding campus safety, fire drill exercises, earthquake 
preparedness instruction, and campus supervision. Our School Safety Plan is updated annually. A discipline plan is 
implemented yearly. Review of safety pract
ices and procedures is ongoing. All efforts to ensure building safety, cleanliness, 
and adequacy have been successful.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Sierra Ridge Middle 
School staff members make every effort to provide a safe, orderly, and disciplined campus 
atmosphere. Sierra Ridge developed and utilizes a Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) system to 
maintain behavioral expectations. These ideals are e
xplicitly taught, modeled and reinforced by all staff  on a continual 
basis. Staff have also implemented Love and Logic strategies for the past two years.  The school to home connection and 
consistent communication is essential to sustaining a safe and ord
erly campus. Appreciation, positive recognition,and self
-
esteem building practices are engrained in the school culture. Positive behavior and student contributions to the school 
are recognized at assemblies during the school year. Student Council leaders a
nd students participating in Sierra Ridge's 
Interact Club provide opportunities for our young teens to contribute to the school and community.
 
 
The school's Emergency Operations Plan is reviewed every year during staff development days before school begins
. The 
most recent review took place in September, 2019. Staff is updated on the plan and made aware of the important details 
in the plan. Sierra Ridge Middle School practices a "Lock Down Drill", "Fire Drill" and " Bus Evacuation" during the first 
week of 
the school year with all staff and students. Monthly evacuation emergency drills are conducted to keep students 
and staff attuned to safety procedures.  The Plan is regularly reviewed and revisions are considered after every major 
emergency.

Beyond evacua
tion procedures, our staff continually receives training aimed at the health and safety of the Sierra Ridge 
Community. Annually, many staff members are trained to administer CPR and first
-
aid. In addition to this training, our 
coaching personnel complete c
lasses on identifying and treating concussions. A school nurse works three days per week 
assisting office personnel, staff, students, and parents with health concerns. This nurse also provides an annual in
-
service 
to review and teach specific health and sa
fety protocols. In addition, Sierra Ridge has a health assistant for the two days 
that the nurse is off campus.  A team of employees is Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI) trained to safely manage disruptive 
and assaultive behaviors. Yard supervision is prov
ided by teachers, paraprofessionals, and the principal before and after 
school and at all passing periods, breaks, and lunch.
