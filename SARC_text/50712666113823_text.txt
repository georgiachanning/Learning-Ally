 School Accountability Report Card
 Reported Using Data from the 2018
-19 School Year
 Published During 2019
-20   By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
   For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.  For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.  For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
  DataQuest
 DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).  Internet Access
 Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-come, first
-served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our mission is to create a caring community partnership where we teach from our hearts, enrich minds and develop skills 
for students to view learning as an enjoyable lifelong journey.
 
 
Dena Boer School opened in February o
f 1997 and enrolls students in transitional
-
kindergarten through 5th grade. The 
school was built in the center of a neighborhood with Mello
-
Roos tax funds and state funds.  Approximately 65% of the 
students are Hispanic, 24% White, 2.4% African
-
American, 3
% Asian and the remaining 5% represent various ethnic 
groups. Approximately 33% are English Learners.
 
 
The school is located on almost 10 acres, with a 5
-
acre county park directly behind the school. It is a clean, well
-
maintained 
facility. The school build
ings feature skylights which open classrooms to natural light. The school has been profiled in 
numerous magazines and publications for the energy savings skylights and open
-
air feel to the classrooms. Safety fences 
were installed in 2015 and several update
s were completed on the site buildings.
 
 
Student achievement and effective teaching go hand in hand, and these are the most important things we do each day. 
We are proud of our students' performance on a variety of measures. Strong Reading and Language Art
s Programs have 
been foundational since our school's beginning, with additional support and materials for our English language learners. 
Dena Boer Elementary School was honored with the California Distinguished School Award in 2002 and 2006. Our school 
was
 
recognized for our work with under
-
achieving students when we received the Title I Academic Achievement Award. 
This same commitment to excellence continues today. We think we have a simple formula that works: Students + Teachers 
+ Parents = Success.
 
 
Stud
ents participate in weekly Physical Education facilitated by the district P.E. teachers.  All students attend classroom 
music instruction and fourth and fifth graders may participate in weekly instrument lessons.  S.O.A.R., the Dena Boer after 
school progr
am, was recognized as the number one program in Stanislaus County.  The program provides quality after 
school services for 120 students each day.  Each month we celebrate our school community, state, and country at our Flag 
Assembly with music, thoughtful 
presentations, community
-
building games, and an emphasis on our Positive Behavior 
Intervention and Supports (PBIS) system.  In addition, the community uses our school facilities for many sports activities.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priori
ty: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We welcome and encourage parent participation in a variety of ways at Dena Boer, as we believe that parent involvement 
in school is extremely important to student success.  Parents are encouraged to volunteer in classrooms, chaperone field 
trips, and volun
teer at a variety of school events.  Some of the ways that we foster parent involvement include:  School 
Site Council (SSC), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) stakeholder 
input meetings, Parents Club Organ
ization, Back to School Night, Open House, Parent Teacher Conferences (interpreters 
available), School Assemblies, and School Communication in English/Spanish via flyers, BlackBoard messages (phone, 
email, text, and app), and the School Website.  Additiona
lly, the Parents Club Organization hosts multiple Family Fun 
Nights, which have included movie nights, spaghetti dinner, ice cream socials, and the Harvest Festival.  The Parents Club 
Organization also wanted to invest in the school. In the past several ye
ars they have provided field trips at each grade 
level, technology to be used in the classroom, a shade structure to cover our outdoor learning and picnic area, instruments 
for our school music program, and an electronic school marquee.

y inspections of the school facility each year. Their findings are written and forwarded to the District 
Maintenance and Operations department, as well as the District Safety Committee.  The District Safety Committee meets 
quarterly to review and monitor s
ite safety matters as indicated in the school inspection reports.  Repair orders are issued 
and safety issues brought into compliance.  Our School Safety Team reviews and updates our Safe School Plan annually, 
reviews with School Site Council and staff, an
d reports the findings to the School Board for their approval.  A copy of the

The key elements of o
ur School Safety Plan include:  Preparedness for emergency and natural disaster, awareness of the 
school's physical and social environments, and expected characteristics of a safe school and school culture.  These 
elements are reviewed annually in a staff 
meeting with school personnel.  Parent/Student and Teacher handbooks are 
prepared and distributed to students and staff for their review on the first day of each school year.  To adequately prepare 
teachers for emergencies, each classroom is equipped with 
an emergency folder including parent contact information. 
Teachers have also been issued packs containing first aid supplies to wear during yard duty and on school field trips.  
Additionally, safety procedures such as proper yard duty techniques and enforc
ement of playground safety rules are 
reviewed during staff meetings throughout the school year.  Dena Boer is in the first phase of implementing the Positive 
Behavior Intervention and Support framework to address the social/emotional needs of students and

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018

To date we have not had any limitations to purchasing materials or providing extra time and services to students who are 
low performing. We will continue to utilize and maximize all resources and staff in providing additional support to low 
performing stud
ents. LCAP and special education funds will all be budgeted to meet the needs of under
-
performing 
students.  The primary focus of our district community liaison is to communicate with our Spanish parents, translate during 
parent/teacher conferences, and pr
ovide written translation in an effort to increase parent involvement.
 
 
Our school has many resources available to assist our students. These resources include: a Learning Support Team lead by 
the Learning Director and paraprofessional support personnel; s
pecial education aides; school nurse and health clerk; 
elementary technology integration support staff; library clerk; support from the district bilingual community liaison for 
translations; Speech Therapist three days per week; Adaptive PE teacher; elemen
tary PE teachers; elementary music 
teachers; school counselor; School Psychologist; SDC classes; and the Salida branch of the Stanislaus County Library.
 
 
These support personnel are funded through a combination of resources including LCAP funding categorie
s.  EL students 
receive daily English language development and reading intervention when identified. English learners receive reading 
intervention from a credentialed teacher. Curriculum resources utilized by our support staff to develop listening, speakin
g, 
reading, and writing skills includes, but is not limited to:  Benchmark Advance Reading, Anita Archer's Phonics for Reading, 
Footsteps2Brillance and iREADY.  The Learning Support Team provides push
-
in support for students in reading and math.  
The Learn
ing Support Team utilizes extra support and supplemental materials from the district adopted language arts 
program.  The Learning Support Team provides targeted intervention instruction for a minimum of 4 times per week in 
each class.  This supplemental in
structional team and our special education staff work together in a Learning Support 
push
-
in model.  This model allows us to allocate more time for student support and to meet the educational needs of 
more students.
