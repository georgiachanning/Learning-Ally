By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Built in 1961, Palisades Elementary School is the only public
 
school in Capistrano Beach. Palisades sits on a bluff, 
surrounded by homes, near the Pacific Ocean. There is a beautiful ocean view from throughout the school, and the 




 
 
The Palisades staff is committed to preparing all st
udents for the 21st century. Dedicated teachers at each grade level 
provide students with learning experiences that are interesting, relevant, creative, and meaningful to their everyday lives. 



more than ever before. To ensure all students are ready for success after high school,
 
the Common Core State Standards 
establish clear, consistent guidelines for what every student should know and be able to do in math and English language 
arts from kindergarten through 12th grade. In addition, the focus at Palisades for the 2019
-
2020 schoo
l year is to improve 
our academics programs with a emphais on math instruction to create 21st century learning opportunities for ALL 
students.
 
 
Palisades goals for the 2019/2020 school year are below:
 
 
Math: The students of Palisades will increase 4% in pr
oblem
-
solving as measured by 3 end of grading period common 
assessments and the summative SBAC test.
 
 
ELA: The students of Palisades will increase 4% in the area of writing as measured by 3 end of the grading period common 
assessments and the summative SBA
C test.

Establish clear and consistent 
expectations for students.
 
 
Establish Tier 1 behavior interventions.
 
 
Palisades has energetic parents who assist staff members and students during the school year in the classroom, front 
office, and throughout the school. There is an active Parent Teacher 
Association (PTA) at Palisades and an Education 
Foundation. Their ongoing support has provided the school with many programs and assemblies. Elected parents and staff 
members on School Site Council review programs for Palisades, oversee categorical money a
nd grants, and review Local 
Control Funding (LCF).
 
 
We believe the most promising strategy for achieving the mission of Palisades Elementary School is to have a staff that:
 

 
unites and works together in a collaborative manner to achieve a common purpose wit
h clear goals that are 
based on the Common Core State Standards and frequent review of student data.
 

 
seeks and implements a variety of strategies to continually improve student achievement.
 

 
demonstrates a personal commitment to the academic success and wel
l
-
being of ALL students.
 

 
monitors each student's academic and social progress throughout the school year.
 
School Mission Statement 
-
 
The mission of Palisades Elementary School is to develop caring, confident, and responsible 
students who love 
learning. Palisades tagline is "Where we learn and grow together".
 
 
Students, parents, and staff members enjoy being part of the Palisades community. Once a Wave, always a Wave. Keep

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Staff members submit Work Orders throughout the school year when a safety hazard is noticed and/or repairs are needed.
 
 
In the summer of 2019, Palisades 
recieved beautification in the following areas: All classrooms and the MPR recieved air 
condition, we recieved three new portables, new floors in the MPR and an updgrade to the strucures of our buildings 
including new drainage.
 
 
Ceiling fans were installed
 
in all main building classrooms in December 2017 and January 2018.
 
 
Portable air conditioning units were placed in all classrooms in the main building in August 2015 since these classes do not 
have permanent air conditioning. Due to the overall cost, poss
ible structural issues with the roof, and possible electrical 
infrastructure issues, Palisades will not have permanent air conditioning installed in these classrooms. The portable 
buildings/classrooms have permanent air conditioning.
 
 
Three projects were c
ompleted during the summer of 2015. The exterior of the school was painted along with a new logo 
on the outside of the multipurpose room. New rubber matting was installed around the preschool playground. A new

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Capistrano Unified School District places great value on the role of professional learning, and utilizes systems
-
wide 
structures and strategies to promote continuous learning of adults that result in 
increased learning for students.  The 
ongoing focus for professional learning is to support the district's Wildly Important Goal for Teaching and Learning.  It is 
the district goal to engage students in meaningful, challenging, and innovative educational e
xperiences to increase post
-
secondary options for all students.
 
 
It is the goal of  Capistrano Unified School District to ensure all students receive Great First Instruction (GFI).  The visi
on 
for GFI is that all learning environments include Lesson Prepar
ation, Interaction, Strategies, and Review and Assessment 
as defined by the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP).  By design, the model for providing professional 
learning is multi
-
tiered, and ranges from large
-
scale, district
-
wide learning op
portunities focused on priority areas to site
-
specific, embedded professional learning (including coaching) that supports teachers in the transfer of that learning to the 

ng during the summer and after 
school hours to further support district initiatives and teacher needs for ongoing professional learning. The outcome of all 
CUSD professional learning is to improve educator effectiveness in order to increase student learnin
g. In support of this 
outcome, administrators participate in professional learning to increase their knowledge of quality practices, California 
Content Standards, and strategies for instructional leadership.
 
 
Since 2004, all schools provide specific releas
e time for embedded professional learning using late start or early release 
days.  In grades K
-
8, this time is known as ACE time (Articulation and Collaboration for Excellence).  The purpose of this 
time is for educators to examine the impact of their prac
tice on student learning, with a focus on continuous improvement.  
Schools work to identify key areas of learning based on an analysis of student data, upon which they place their focus for 
professional learning and set annual measurable goals based upon t
hose identified areas of need. These areas are 
determined through the analysis of student learning data from multiple sources, including, but not limited to high stakes 
testing. The action plan developed to accomplish these goals outlines priorities for te
acher training and implementation.
 
 
Throughout the year, the structure of collaboration typically involves teacher teams engaging in ongoing examination of 
standards
-
based curriculum, the examination of meaningful formative and summative assessment data, a
nd powerful 
teaching strategies that get results in student learning. In 2017 the District developed the CUSD Professional Learning 

Goals
, Relational Trust, Focus on Learning, Shared Responsibility, Action
-
Oriented, Data Driven, and Systems and 
Structures for Support  to ensure all students are learning at high levels.  These embedded professional learning activities 
help prepare teams to p
rovide a differentiated instructional program that meets the needs of all students.
 
 
Beginning teachers receive systematic training and support during their first two years of teaching within the CUSD 
Induction Program. This program assists new teachers as
 
they build upon the skills they already possess upon entering the 
field of teaching, and provides them with support from a veteran teacher. The program is approved by the California State 
Commission on Teacher Credentialing and meets the requirements nece

to those activities previously described, all teachers may receive support, assistance, and opportunities to grow 
professionally through their participation in school site learning teams, student study tea
ms, from district resource 
teachers, and the Peer Assistance and Review Program.
