Like the roaring '20s, our district is poised to make some noise in 2020!
 
LEUSD student accountability showed meaningful gains with the latest California School Dashboard 

focus on Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) to provide
 
teachers and principals with critical 
performance data to guide daily instruction, helping students succeed!
 
 

open in August of 2020. This new TK
-
5 school
 
will feature state
-
of
-
the
-
art solar energy efficiency, 
flexible classroom furniture and configurable classroom space, exciting classroom technology, and 
advanced campus security systems.
 
 
Recent facilities projects funded by the recent Measure V school bo
nd include flexible classroom 
furniture, artificial turf replacement, playground refurbishment, LED lighting conversions, and 
classroom technology purchases. Grant funded CTE program expansion will significantly update our 
existing engineering, agriculture
, and medical career pathways. All LEUSD high school performing 
arts centers have recently received state
-
of
-
the
-
art sound and lighting upgrades, and new theater 
seating plus stage refurbishments are coming next.
 
 
A previously shuttered campus in Wildomar,
 
Jean Hayman Elementary, was reopened this summer 
under a new development plan that will unfold over the next five years. Phase 1 tenant 
improvements were recently completed to accommodate the Southern California EMS Training 
Institute. Phase 2 will includ
e refurbishment of the existing multipurpose room for professional 
development, staff training, community meeting rooms, and expanded parking. Phases 3 and 4 
include the relocation of existing adult education programs, new site
-
based child care, plus 
separ
ate parking. Phase 5 will complete the relocation of our existing Adult Transition Program; 
also, installation of affordable housing for teachers as an incentivized recruitment strategy, 
enabling LEUSD to stay competitive in a statewide teacher shortage.
 
 
As you can see, 2020 and the beginning of a new decade has plenty for everyone to shout about!
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Dr. Doug Kimberly, Superintendent

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
dist
rict office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Lake Elsinore Unified School District (LEUSD) is committed to 
maintaining a safe, secure, and aesthetically pleasing environment for our students. 
The LEUSD Governing Board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the District. A summary of these standards is ava
ilable at the school office 
and at the Distric
t Office. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
In addition 
to District
-
level support of routine and periodic maintenance needs, LEUSD holds high standards for cleanliness, appea
rance, and good repair of all 
campuses daily and maintains them through the efforts of the students, staff, day custodian, evening custodial crew, and Dist
rict Maintenance 
Department. Our maintenance staff ensures the repairs necessary to keep the school i
n good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner.
 
 
A work
-
order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. LEUSD regularly 
assesses maintenance, 
modernization, and new construction
 
needs. Any pesticide use at our school sites is in compliance with the Healthy Schools Act of 2000.
 
 
Fire drill evacuations are conducted on a monthly basis at all elementary and middle schools, and twice a year at the high sc
hools in the District. A fire
 
safety inspection is conducted once each year by the Riverside County Fire Department, while site personnel conduct site insp
ections on a regular basis.
 
 

imes per year at each elementary school and middle 
school, and once each semester at the high schools.
 
 
Currently, the District provides storage areas for emergency supplies to be kept on campus in the event of a disaster. A radi
o communication system 
allo
ws for continuous communication with the District office in the event of a disaster.
 
 
A Crisis Intervention Team has been identified and trained to deal with stress experienced by students and staff as a result 
of a crisis situation. Team 
members are calle
d upon to assist across the District as necessary. As part of the comprehensive School Safety Program, School Resource Office
rs provide 
prevention and intervention procedures on all LEUSD campuses at least part time.
 
 
Our school was built in the 1880, thou
gh no original structure currently exist.  We currently have 28 regular classrooms, two computer labs, one iPad lab, 
a library,  a multipurpose room, and five special education rooms. The designed capacity of the school is approximately 800 s
tudents. Athle
tic facilities 
include a blacktop and athletic field with two backstops for baseball related activities, a kindergarten playground structure
, and two playground structure 
areas for grades 1
-
5.
 
 
Our staff is working on redefining our discipline policy as we
 
are in the first year of implementing a Positive Behavior Support system that is supported 
by training in the principals of Boystown training.

ter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible
 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

School Safety Plan
 
The Safe School Plan (SSP) is up
dated annually at each site to address components that the site will proactively seek to improve as it relates to student 
and staff safety. The SSP is available to the public for review upon request.  This year, the plan was developed with the ass
istance a
nd support of a variety 
of stakeholders. The plan for the 2019
-
2020 school year was reviewed and approved by our School Site Council on November 12th, 2019.
 
 
Component #1 of the plan is to provide continuous training to the campus supervisors in conflict m
anagement and resolutions through the use of the 
BoysTown curricula.  Additionally, to provide training in playground game rules and in proactive intervention.
 
 
Component #2 of the plan is to regularly review, address and update campus security concerns, i
ncluding ensuring that all adult visitors have volunteer 
badges or visitor stickers and that no unauthorized personnel enters the campus.

I, Part A (Title I) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as amended (ESEA) provides financial assistance to local 
educational agencies (LEAs) and schools with high numbers or high percentages of children from low

income families to help ensure t
hat all 
children meet challenging state academic standards. Federal funds are currently allocated through four statutory formulas tha
t are based

the LCFF creates base, supplemental, and concentration grants in place of most previously existing K

12 funding streams, including revenue 
limits and 
most state categorical programs.
 
 
At Wildomar Elementary, we currently employ 1
