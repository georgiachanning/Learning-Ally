About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is requir
ed by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) 
are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an L
CAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Pacific University in th
e CHAMP Program, as well as support from the Duarte Elks Lodge and Golden State Foods Foundation which Lee has collaborated 
with for several years.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pup
il suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 

dness plan inc
ludes steps 
for ensuring student and staff safety during an emergency or disaster. Fire, Earthquake, Lock
-
down drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout 
the school year. Annually, the school practices a complete earthquake drill, which includes an
 
entire school evacuation. A storage bin located at the 
school contains food, water, and other supplies for use during an emergency or disaster.  In addition, an emergency backpack 
with supplies is stored in 
each classroom. The backpack holds a first aid k
it and student information cards. Principal, teachers, and support staff are trained and practice lock down 
procedures in order to secure the entire campus in case of an emergency.  In addition, Principal, teachers, and support staff
 
supervise the campus b
efore 
and after school, and during recess and lunch to ensure the safety of all the students.  All visitors must sign in at the fro
nt office, wear identification tags 
while on the school grounds and sign out upon departure.
 
 
A Comprehensive School Safety P
lan was developed by the Safety Committee in order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997. The plan provides students 
and staff a means to ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. Key elements of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan inc
lude the foll
owing: 
monthly facility safety inspections; child abuse reporting procedures; teacher notification of dangerous pupils procedures; d
isaster response procedures; 
procedures for safe entering to, and exiting from, school; sexual harassment policy; suspension
 
and expulsion policies; dress code; and discipline policies. 
The Safety Committee evaluated the plan in May 2019 and updates were made as needed.

full and partial days as well as early student release day opportunities. Student achievement data continues to be the 
determining factor in the selection of professional learning topics. The primary areas of focus for professional learning in 
the last thr

in the area of supporting teachers as it relates to math, and ELA/ELD, history
