School Description
 
The "vision" and mission of Gerald F. Litel Elementary School is 
predicated upon a belief and upon 
a commitment to our students that ensures a quality program to all of our student learners. We, 
believe the potential of all students may be attained through high expectations, a positive, safe 
learning environment, in con
junction with meaningful communication with our parents and the 
Litel community.  Litel Elementary School is committed to providing an atmosphere where learning 

l 
gifts. Further, we teach our students to respect others; learn to view the world in a variety of ways; 
and live with honesty and purpose as contributing members of society. Additionally,Gerald F. Litel 
Elementary School will provide students with opportu
nities to think critically, will engage in 
academic discourse, and will prepare our student learners for college and career readiness.
 
 
Moreover,Gerald F. Litel Elementary School aspires to educate all students, and  we are committed 
to narrowing deficits 
for students who struggle. Also, we are committed to teach our our students 
how to become proficient users of technology, and to be able to demonstrate the "4 C's" through 
creativity, collaboration, critical thinking, and communication. The focus of our fa
culty is to provide 
instruction to our students in alignment to the English Language Arts Shifts (1
-
3), to promote, teach, 
and provide opportunities for our students to demonstrate critical thinking, to focus on the 
Standards of Mathematical Practices (1,2
,3 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8)), and to implement positive behavior 
supports school
-
wide. Students will be expected to strive to produce quality work, demonstrate 
understanding of other perspectives by working and/or playing together, and to build content 
content t
hrough purposeful and active listening.
 
 
School
-
wide SMART goals include the following three goals:
 
1). 
 
70% of all students will Meet or Exceed Standards within the Mathematics portion on the 
2019
-
2020 CAASPP.
 
2). 
 
72% of all students will Meet or Exceed 
Standards within the English Language Arts portion 
on the 2019
-
2020 CAASPP.
 
3).
 
Family involvement will be increased by giving stakeholders the opportunity to provide 
input on universal foundations every 12 months to increase TFI Feature 1.11 to a score of
 
"2" and an overall Tiered Fidelity Inventory Implementation score of 100%. In addition, 
the Check In and Check Out (CICO) intervention will be piloted by the team.
 
 
The two academic goals will be measured three times yearly and the metric utilized will th
e 
Essential Standards Assessment that will be administered in October, December, and in March.
 
The Family Involvement goal will be measured twice through internal TFI audits and then through 
an external TFI audit in March which will be conducted by an outs
ide evaluator.

Programs that continue to appeal to our student learners include a Walk
-
Through Ancient Civilizations offered to our sixth grade
 
students 
and a Walk
-
Through Colonial America offered to our fifth grade students. Our fourth grade students travel to the Mission San Juan 
Capistrano and they engage in California Days toward the end of the year. In addition, our third grade students atte
nd a play and at least 
two other field trips during the school year. Our second grade students travel to the Jurupa Science Center while or first gr
ade and 
Kindergarten students travel to different field trips based on hands on exploration. Our students in
 
need of intervention are provided with 
"interventive" measures inside the school day while some of our students will be invited to attend an after school math and r
eading 
intervention program which is funded by the school. In addition, we have a highly po
pular Science Detectives offered after school which 
supports students' love of science through exploration, engagement, enrichment, experimentation, and collaboration. Our GATE 
students 
have been afforded the opportunity to participate with a Math Olympiad
 
which promotes critical thinking, problem solving, working to 
solve rigorous math problems, and the opportunity to collaborate in small groups to solve very challenging math problems.
 
 
The" Mission" of Gerald F. Litel Elementary School is to educate all s
tudents in an environment that welcomes student diversity and 
promotes student collaboration. Further, the faculty aspires to lead and to develop instruction as a collective group of lear
ners who 
recognize that all students are capable of learning more tha
n they did last year.  The faculty and staff at Litel Elementary School, in 
partnership with our parents, believe that student achievement can be attained through a viable, guaranteed curriculum that i
s 
undertaken in a safe learning environment where a pos
itive school culture is demonstrated daily. Through teaching and rewarding the 
school
-
wide behavioral expectations; THE ROAR, students are taught to (BE RESPONSIBLE, BE OPTIMISTIC, BE ACCOUNTABLE, and BE 
RESPECTFUL). Further, the faculty of Gerald F. Litel
 
Elementary School will continue to develop as a cadre of learners, the faculty will 
observe one another through our Collaborative Learning Rounds which will emphasize best educational practices and focus instr
uctional 
strategies that align with the learni
ng intentions and success criteria which will ultimately lead to improve student learning and increase 
in student achievement for all learners at the school.
 
 
CORE BELIEFS
 
1). All students can learn more than they did last year
 
2). Positive school 
climate supports student learning
 
3). Collaboration, cooperation, and mutual respect are essential to enriching the lives of students
 
4). High Academic expectations can be met through excellent teaching and active learning
 
5). Parents/guardians are our par
tners in the educational system
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
conta
ins information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describ
es how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about 
SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent 
Year)
 
Chino Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) makes it a priority to maintain safe, clean, and effective school sites for our 
students, staff, and parents. The 
safety of students is of paramount importance to CVUSD. In the morning, staff supervision i
s provided to watch the cafeteria, entrance gates, and 
playground activities. During lunch and recess times, noon ground supervisors and teachers monitor students to ensure student
s interact safely. At the 
end of the school day, staff supervises student di
smissal. The staff and student workspaces for this site are cleaned on a regular basis by the school site 
custodial staff. In addition to regular cleanings, deep cleanings are scheduled and carried out during breaks and vacation pe
riods. The school facilit
y is 
adequate and has sufficient classrooms, playgrounds, and staff spaces in order to operate efficiently. A planned or recently 
completed school 
improvement for this site is a full school modernization project currently in progress and a schoolwide secur
ity camera and keyless access system in 
progress.
 
 
To ensure sites are clean, safe and functional, Maintenance and Operations department staff conduct inspections at the school
 
sites on a continual basis. 
School sites may also enter maintenance requests by
 
accessing the School Dude system. After the school site request is entered into the system, a work 
order is generated, and the Maintenance staff works diligently to complete all work orders in a timely manner.  The Maintenan
ce team utilized the Facility 
I
nspection Tool (FIT), a survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction (OPSC), t
o record inspection results.

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

A high degree of community involvement, including parent volunteers, business partnerships, volunteers from the local high sc
hools, and an active PTA 
work together to enhance the learning environment, and to evaluate 


arent newsletter which 
emerged from a "survey form" th
at was in response to our parents and community. Also, there is a section in every monthly publication in which our 
wonderful PTA updates and apprises all parents and community members as to time sensitive information as well as opportunitie
s for parent 
in
volvement.  New this year, based on feedback received from our School Site Council, is the request to explain some of the edu
cational acronyms such 
as Social
-
Emotional Learning, our Student Teacher Excellence Program (STEP), and Thinking Maps.  A portion o
f our newsletter will inform parents as to 
educational programs such as PBIS; Positive Behavior Intervention Supports. Lastly, the principal will continue to inform the
 
parents of new developments 
regarding the modernization of the campus.
 
 
Additionally, L
itel is a proud partner with our District and we are excited to recommend the Kindergarten Readiness Academy to our parents. 
The 
Kindergarten Readiness Academy was first offered to our parents four years ago, and it was a rousing success. The parents att
en
ded this 4
-
week academy 
with their children and, together, they were able to experience, firsthand, the skills necessary to enter Kindergarten and ta
ckle the Common Core State 
Standards. Based on parent feedback, support, and attendance, we realized that t
his was a wonderful way to welcome our students and parents to Litel 
Elementary School. Further, the parents were able to tour the campus, visit our kindergarten classes, and learn from a former
 
kindergarten teacher. We 
are optimistic that our academy will
 
continue to grow.  This program is now presented at the Family Learning Network partnership which is housed at 
the adult school. Speaking of Kindergarten, enrollment for our incoming kindergarten students is now offered on
-
line. In addition, all incoming 
registered 
kindergarten students are offered a brief ten to fifteen assessment that informs our kindergarten team as to skills already l
earned and skills that students 
still need to practice prior to beginning Kindergarten. Then, this information is shared
 
with the parents and they still have the entire summer to prepare 
for kindergarten equipped with an action plan of skills to work on or enhance.

Our School Site Council, English Language Learner Advisory Committee, GATE Committee, LCAP Forum, and Safe Sc
hool Committee are also among the 
variety of committees that parents and staff participate in at Litel. We are very fortunate to have parents who see the value
 
in volunteering as evidenced 
in a number of ways. Parents assist in the classroom, chaperone fie
ld trips, they volunteer to load the buses during and after science camp, they volunteer 
during our highly successful after school program, Science Detectives, and they bring high and positive energy, and a strong 
sense of "volunteerism," that 
we are truly
 
fortunate to have them support all of our students. Litel Elementary School has a very active Parent Teacher Association invo
lved in the 
Picture Person Program, membership drives, fundraisers, school events, assemblies, and Family Fun Nights. Parent and s
tudent volunteers dedicate 
thousands of hours to assist our staff in the enhancement of the educational programs at Litel Elementary School.  A vital co
ntribution that the PTA made 
to Litel was their financial backing for the very popular Student of the Mo
nth program that recognizes students in an intimate luncheon in which parents 
are invited to participate in celebrating their children.  The students receive two certificates; one for academic recognitio
n and one for a food certificate.  
The parents and st
udents love this program which is made available through the Herculean efforts of the PTA. The Fun Club daycare program is a 
partner
-
in
-
education program designed to benefit our students and parents. In addition, The Litel staff acknowledges how very fortu
nate we are to have the 
support from the many members of the community for the benefit of our students.  Lastly, based on parent surveys, Litel Eleme
ntary School offers after
-
school enrichment in the area of STEM.  Three different sessions are being offere
d this school year including an 8 week STEM enrichment program 
dedicated to engineering followed by two
-
6 week sessions dedicated to art.

Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Each school has a detailed School Site Safety Plan for emergencies that is annually reviewed, updated, and discussed by the S
chool Site Council. The date 
on which the School Site Safety Plan 
was last annually reviewed was March 2019, and the plans are reviewed monthly by the School Site Council.  Each 

onents and procedur
es. 
Fire, earthquake, and intruder drills are held on a regular basis so that all students and staff are familiar with emergency 
procedures. Emergency supplies 
are located on each campus in the event of an emergency.
 
 
Assigned staff monitors school grounds
 
daily before, during, and after school.  The District policy regarding campus visitors is enforced by requiring 

-
in log is located in the school office and all visitors 
must sign in before 
going onto the campus. In addition, all visitors must wear an identifying badge while on campus. To increase security, all ga
tes remain locked during the 
school day, so visitors must enter campus through the school office.
 
 
The Chino Va
lley Unified School District is committed to providing an environment that fosters health and safety, in both form and functi
on. This 
commitment extends to the process of developing and maintaining a comprehensive Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan a

Safe Schools Plan and is evident from the individual site to the overall District. These plans delineate actions to protect a
ll students while they are at 
school. The plans are designed with the help of security staff members, lo
cal law enforcement, local fire, and emergency management, and public health 
officials as required by Education Code 32280
-
32282.
 
 
Plans are reviewed and updated yearly in accordance with Education Code 32286. These plans include procedures to respond to c
ritical incidents, such 
as fire, earthquake, or intruders. School personnel practice these drills regularly.
 
 
The primary purpose of the Chino Valley Unified School District Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan is to define roles a
nd 
responsibilities at the 
site and between the site and district office management. The Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan establishes the minimu
m requirements for 
school and site plans throughout the District. This Plan meets the requirements of the S
tandardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) as mandated 
by California Code of Regulations, Sections 2400
-
2450, and the National Incident Management System (NIMS) as mandated by Government Code 8607. 
It also meets the requirements for earthquake prepared
ness found in Title 5 (California State Education Code, Sections 35295
-
35297).
