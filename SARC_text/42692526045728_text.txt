School Description
 
Montecito Union School, recertified as a California Distinguished School in 2018, is a one
-
school district serving the 
community of Montecito with transitional kindergarten through sixth grade. The District
 
is comprised of a middle to upper 
socioeconomic population and has a current enrollment of approximately 360 students. It is governed by a five
-
member 
Board of Trustees and is administered by a Superintendent, Principal, Assistant Principal, and Chief Bus
iness Official.
 
 
Montecito Union School District, a historic cornerstone of the community, is dedicated to providing a comprehensive 
educational foundation, cultivating a passion for learning, honoring the unique qualities and strengths of our children, an
d 
challenging them to attain their full potential.
 
 
We live in a time of constant change that includes increasing globalization, vast amounts of information, the dominance of 
science and technology, complex environmental challenges, and the integration of 
cultures.  These changes call for new 
ways of teaching, learning, and thinking.
 
 
The vision of MUS is to launch inspired thinkers who positively impact the world.  We strive to provide our students with 
the academic foundation to creatively solve complex p
roblems, teaching them to apply interpersonal and collaborative 
skills, and to demonstrate a genuine sense of curiosity in a student
-
focused and supportive environment.  Our students will 
be empowered thinkers who positively impact and adapt to our ever
-
ch
anging and diverse world.
 
 
Specific core beliefs form the cornerstone of the Mission and Vision for Montecito Union School.
 
 
1.
 
We commit to creating a school community in which each student is known and nurtured in an atmosphere of 
physical and emotional saf
ety, as well as trust and respect.
 
2.
 
We believe in seeking joy, wonder, and the love of learning.
 
3.
 
We commit to providing a comprehensive experience that allows our students to reach their highest potential 
academically, artistically, athletically, and social
ly.
 
4.
 
We believe collaboration among the community, parents, the school board, administration, and staff leads to 

 
5.
 
We believe all students, employees and volunteers can me
et high standards of excellence.
 
6.
 
We commit to researching, developing, and applying best practices in order to continually improve all aspects of 
MUS.
 
7.
 
We believe educators are learners who model and nurture intellectual curiosity and rigor, and interdiscip
linary 
and collaborative inquiry.
 
8.
 
We commit to designing and delivering a relevant, rigorous, and integrated curriculum that engages students in 
critical and creative thinking, and allows them to be inquirers and problem solvers.
 
9.
 
We commit to teaching char
acter attributes such as leadership, kindness, respect, persistence, integrity, courage, 
and empathy through example, digital citizenship, purposeful instruction, and meaningful application.
 
10.
 
We believe service to others is an essential component of Monteci
to Union School and the greater community.
 
11.
 
We commit to developing the dispositions of personal responsibility and accountability for our learning 
community.
 
12.
 
We commit to modeling and promoting environmental stewardship.
 
 
Guided by our Strategic Plan, MUS has embarked on a journey with Project Zero from Harvard University over the last ten 
years.  Our staff has been and continues to be, extensively trained in the tenets of Visible Thinking.  With the support of t
he 
Montecit

one year of service to Harvard University to better understand how to help our students think and understand.  Visible 
Thinking is a flexible 
and systematic research
-
based approach to integrating the development of students' thinking with 
content learning across subject matters. An extensive and adaptable collection of practices, Visible Thinking has a double 
goal: on the one hand, to cultivate 
students' thinking skills and dispositions, and on the other, to deepen content learning. 
By thinking dispositions, we mean curiosity, concern for truth and understanding, a creative mindset, not just being skilled,
 
but also alert to thinking and learning 
opportunities and eager to take them on.  When you walk into any of our classrooms, 
expect to see students being asked: Why? What makes you say that?  Tell me more?  Students are regularly asked to provide 
evidence for their answers, to engage in dialogue 

abstractly, and to apply their understanding to novel situations.  Throughlines help students make connections from facts, 
details, and formulas to patterns, trends, and ideas.  We f
irmly believe that teaching students to think will empower them 
on high
-
stakes tests as well as in their future studies and careers.

Another key component of our curriculum is focused on the work of Lucy Calkins and the Reading and Writing Workshop Project. 
 
Through experience
s at Columbia 
University in New York, summer institutes, and expert trainings on
-
site, our teachers have received extensive support in their literacy instruction in order to not only teach 
our students to read but to love reading.  Readers Workshop focuses
 
on the central role of curriculum development and planning in teaching reading, explicitly teaching 
comprehension strategies, the importance of assessment
-
based instruction, the role of the read
-
aloud book, methods of holding our students accountable for 
doing their 
best work, helping students grow ideas about literature, and classroom structures that support inquiry and collaboration.  We
 
are also able to regularly send staff members 
to regional institutes to further our understanding and implementation o
f Readers and Writers Workshop.  Through mini
-
lessons, making connections, and supporting 
students with an abundance of "just right" reading materials, our students learn to love to read and read to learn.  Our expe
rience has demonstrated that the major te
nets 
of Readers Workshop closely align with the major throughlines of Visible Thinking, teaching students to be engaged, curious, 
critical thinkers.
 
 
Encompassing each academic area is our school
-
wide focus on implementing Costa and Kallick's
 
16 Habits of Mind.  We were fortunate to be one of twelve schools in the 
United States named as an International Habits of Mind School of Excellence.  Art Costa and Bena Kallick have spent numerous 
days working with our staff and community 
so that we can 
better develop those mental qualities, attitudes, and dispositions that all students need to be successful, such as demonstra
ting persistence, flexibility, 
empathy and more.  Teachers weave instruction in the Habits of Mind throughout all areas, such as id
entifying traits of historical figures or literary characters, seeing 
connections between persistent or flexible animals in science, or noting the importance of striving for accuracy in mathemati
cs.
 
 
The Habits of Mind serve as a framework for student char
acter development. Proactive dialogue circles (Mustang Meetings) are utilized routinely in all classrooms as a 
vehicle for building Habits such as listening with empathy, thinking about thinking, managing impulsivity, thinking and commu
nicating with clarit
y, and thinking 
interdependently. Dialogue circles can be utilized for daily check
-
ins, for establishing class norms, for celebrating successes, and for exploring solutions to ongoing conflicts 
and complex problems. This classroom routine supports students
 

productive school community. When conflict arises, administrators are trained in using dialogue circles as a vehicle for reso
lving issues and repairing
 
the community. Staff 
members utilize dialogue circles in staff meetings and PLCs to establish common needs and explore potential conflicts. This s
erves as a model for students about our core 
values with respect to ongoing relationship building and conflic

develop the grit and persistence necessary for lifelong success in a world where content knowledge is vast, fast, and fleetin
g.
 
 
The circle structure b
ecomes a key component in managing conflict. The school utilizes restorative approaches for managing student misbehavior. Thi
s high
-
accountability, 
high
-
support system focusses energy on students identifying the impacts of their behavior and strategies for
 
helping to mitigate these impacts. In addition to circles, 
mindfulness practices are embedded into the classroom and into recess to give students skills to slow down, better manage imp
ulsivity, and increase focus and attention. 
At MUS, we see recess as an
 
important element in students' social
-
emotional development. To support this development daily pathways exist to allow students to explore 
service
-
learning opportunities, play sports, and participate in STEAM
-
based activities. These pathways provide struc
ture to the recess and allow students to form new 
relationships around common interests.
 
 

e
-
level teams weekly to develop common 
th
roughlines, activities, and assessments.  They analyze students' work together and talk about their practice in order to grow
 
professionally.  The entire staff collaborates 
three times a month as well, practicing thinking routines, developing common expect

in teaching and learning.  In addition, each staff member has access to significant professional development dollars to use a
t their discretion with the approval of a 
leadership 
committee, allowing for our teachers to explore areas of particular interest and need outside of our larger school initiative
s.
 
 
Small class sizes with a school
-
wide average of approximately 18 students per class, as well as having instructional
 
assistants in each classroom help us ensure that we 
provide each of our students with the time and attention he or she needs.  The school implements and continuously refines an 
organized and articulated set of common 
benchmark assessments to help us celeb
rate student successes, while also enabling us to quickly identify students who are struggling.  Regular child study meetings
 
are 
held where a committee of diverse stakeholders (special educators, classroom teachers, specialists, administration and parent
s
) come together to create individualized 
plans for student intervention that support achievement.  In addition to a resource teacher, speech therapist, counselor, and
 
psychologist, we also employ reading and 
math specialists to provide individual or small 
group intervention when students are struggling to have their needs met in the regular classroom.  These structures and 
systems help ensure that no student falls through the cracks.
 
 
In addition to our strong focus on language arts and mathematics, we also
 
believe that our students benefit from development in the arts, world language, and other areas.  
Students enjoy regular visits to our well
-
equipped music and art rooms as well as a state
-
of
-
the
-
art computer lab.  Each second and third
-
grader is immersed 
in instruction 
with an individual violin for two years of strings study with our music specialist.  In our one
-
to
-
one initiative, each third, fourth, fifth and sixth grader is assigned an Apple 
laptop for composition, research, and presentations, while TK
-

professionally designed art gallery.  Our physical education teachers help support healthy living and sportsmanship through b
i
-
weekly outdoor sessions
 
for each class.  Our 
Spanish teachers work with students twice weekly, encouraging cultural awareness and language acquisition.  Our science speci
alist coordinates our learning labs with 
exciting equipment and materials in addition to engaging STEAM activ
ities to support classroom science units.  A math specialist supports teachers by helping design lessons 
and provides professional development, as well as providing MTSS support for students.  Our technology specialist similarly h
elps infuse technology int
o teachers' 
curriculum.  A librarian is on hand for weekly classroom visits and is available to help connect students to over 22,000 titl
es housed in our library.
 
 
Students at Montecito Union receive an enriched education through many other activities supp
orted generously by the MUSF.  Individual grade levels partake in residencies, 
bringing in experts for extended study of African drumming, movement, poetry, storytelling, colonial experiences, primitive l
iving, and much more.  Numerous field trips 
bring le
arning to life, helping students make connections to discussions and text in the classroom.
 
 
All of these incredible attributes of Montecito Union help us to provide our students with our vision of a global standard of
 
educational excellence.  We prepare o
ur students 
to think, to be good citizens, to appreciate and understand the arts, and ultimately to fulfill our mission by providing a co
mprehensive educational foundation, cultivating a 
passion for learning, honoring the unique qualities and strengths of 
our children, and challenging them to attain their full potential.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in
 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educati
onal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, 
data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

For additional information about the school, 
parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
A safe, attractive, and motivating learning 
environment is a priority for the Montecito Union School District. This is ensured by the work of the Safety 
Committee, Facilities Manager, and an outstanding and dedicated janitorial/maintenance staff consisting of a full
-
time manager, three full
-
time day
 
custodians, four full
-
time custodians who work afternoons and evenings, and one gardener.
 
 
Building Inventory: Montecito Union School currently consists of seven buildings containing 35 classrooms, a library/technolo
gy center, a maintenance 
shop, and a co

-
grade classrooms were built in the 1930s. The 
main building, in addition to the classrooms, includes an office complex, teacher workroom, auditorium, faculty room, sci
ence lab, and a 
custodial/maintenance workroom. Two single
-
story buildings for kindergarten and first grade were built in the 1950s.  The library/technology center was 
completed in 1993. The center includes a state
-
of
-
the
-
art library and innovation lab, a 
book room, and workroom.
 
 
In April 1995, a building containing six classrooms was completed. This building houses our fifth
-
grade classrooms, afterschool program headquarters, 
and a Spanish classroom. In November 1997, voters within the Montecito Union Sch
ool District approved a $4.5 million bond issue for new classroom 
construction. The project allowed for the building of 17 new classrooms and was completed in time for the opening of school i
n September 2000. This 
project replaced the last remaining portab
le classrooms on the site.
 
 
Grounds Inventory: Montecito Union School is located on approximately 8 acres of land. The northern half of the school proper
ty consists of grassy 
terraces including a soccer field, track, newly renovated basketball courts and a
 
volleyball court, handball courts, tetherball courts, a softball field, 
playground equipment, and an obstacle course. The southern half of the school property contains the school buildings, blackto
p, grass play areas, organic 
garden, playground equipment,
 
and outdoor education areas. Four drop
-
off and pick
-
up parking lot areas were made available with the completion of 
the building addition in the fall of 2000.
 
 
In 2007 the District acquired 2.2 acres of land adjacent to the southern boundary of the existi
ng school footprint.  The acquisition of this land will allow 
for the future development and expansion of Montecito Union School and is currently providing additional staff parking.
 
 
The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Progra
m to assist with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school 
building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or e
xterior painting, and floor 
systems.  In the summe
r of 2019, the District will complete accessibility upgrades to the main parking lot, will replace two play structures, and w
ill 
improve accessibility and drainage in our largest play spaces.  In addition, the District has plans to use State funds and in
te
rnal funds to renovate our two 
oldest buildings within the next five years.

School Safety Plan
 
The Goal of the Montecito Union School District is to create a school environment conducive to learning. Safety is central to
 
this goal. When children are 
safe, they are able to learn. Simply stated, safety is central to the daily operation of the school.
 
The School Safety Plan was last reviewed, updated, and 
discussed with the school faculty in September of 2019 and approved by the Board of Trustees on August 20, 2019.
 
 
It has been stated that school climate is the single most important component of a saf
e school. On every level, Montecito Union demonstrates the 
characteristics of a school that seeks to create a positive, caring school climate. It begins with the Student Pledge:
 
 

others with kindness, respect, and integrity. I understand that I am responsible 

 
 
Strategies, programs, and procedures address the manner in which the school complies with existing laws 
related to school safety.  These comprehensive 
plans address student discipline, safe routes to school, safe and drug
-
free environment, non
-
discrimination and harassment, child abuse reporting, 
environmental safety, and disaster preparedness. The school al
so implements an articulated and embedded character education program that teaches 
students successful dispositions and habits of mind such as persistence, managing impulsivity, and demonstrating empathy.
 
 
Once each month all students and staff participate
 
in a safety drill, including lockdowns, shelter in place, earthquake, fire, and debris flow scenarios.
 
 
Independent inspections take place in the following areas:
 
 
Fire: the Montecito Fire District conducts a fire inspection annually. Any discrepancies fo
und in any areas of fire safety standards and regulations are 
immediately corrected.
 
 
Earthquake: All buildings have been approved by the Office of State Architect with regard to earthquake (Field Act) standards
.
 
 
Asbestos: An asbestos specialist from the 

conducts an inspection annually. The District is in compliance with all AHERA regulations.
 
 
Playground/Buildings: On a regular basis, an inspection 
team consisting of the Facilities Manager, Campus Support Supervisor and Assistant Principal 
inspects the school site and identifies items needing attention. Items listed are corrected in a timely manner.
 
 
School committees are also in place to address spe
cific concerns:
 
 
Facilities Master Plan Committee: The goal of the committee is to engage in long range facilities planning and implementation
 
of the District's Master 
Plan.
 
 
Safety Committee: This committee addresses all aspects of student, staff, and sch
ool safety.  It works to develop and promote safe routes to and from 
school, monitors potential hazards that might impact student safety, examines policies and procedures, and observes, monitors
 
and reflects on pick
-
up 
and drop
-
off, safety drills, parking 
lot safety, traffic and more.

During the summers of 2010
-
2017 All permanent teachers of Montecito Union teachers have traveled to Harvard University to study "
Project 
Zero," which involves the strategies exemplified in "Visible Thinking." K/1 teachers also spent a week at Columbia University
 
studying 
readers' workshop in 2010 and all staff members have received ongoing support through the use of a consultant for
 
up to 15 days a year.
 
So often, educators attend trainings and are momentarily inspired only to forget what they learned as the latest fad hits the
 
spotlight. The structures of 
grade level and school

wide professional learning communities along with the f
act that teachers have all shared a common experience have helped build
