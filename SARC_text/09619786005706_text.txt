School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.

Opportunities for Pa
rental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school staff enjoys a high level of community support and involvement in all aspects of our educational programs.  
Parents participate in collaborative planning of our school
-
based program through School 
Site Council meetings. 
Additionally, our PTO works with school staff to identify school
-
wide needs that can be supported through parent 
volunteers and community fund raising events.  Outstanding examples of these events are the PTO Fall Festival, Read
-
A
-
Th
on, Giving Gala, Jackson JOG, and Scrip sales. Proceeds from these events have provided our students with a video 
production lab, dance studio, outdoor school garden, school
-
wide educational resources,  school marquee, art murals, a 
new sound system in our
 
gym, kindergarten and elementary play structures, and many outstanding special events 
including our annual Science Fair and Family Science Night.
 
 
Parents have an opportunity to participate on a variety of levels.  Parents assist in classrooms during the 
Language Arts 
block and during math lessons.  Parents help in the school garden with classes and help with upkeep of the garden over 
the summer months.  The library coordinator utilizes parent help in our library.  The PTO board also offers a wide variety 
of opportunities to help support classrooms and school events.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Ruppel Center, amphitheater, lunch facility, stage, and computer lab were completed in December 1999. Due to 
continued growth, the district is in the process of planning for 
additional future school sites.   Jackson School is on a 
traditional schedule.   Policies and procedures are in place regarding campus safety, fire drill exercises, earthquake 
preparedness and playground supervision. The PBIS team evaluates and implements 
rules and procedures for staff and 
students.  The Safe School Plan sets goals each year for campus improvements and campus safety goals.  The custodial 
staff maintains our campus to ensure cleanliness and maintenance.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
All Rescue schools receive equal allocations, per student, of LCFF Base Funding.  This funding helps support students by 
providing instructional materials, supplies and other needs.  Funding for support services, such as maintenance of buildings 
and ground
s, utilities, and student transportation, is budgeted for at the district level and provided to each school site 
based on the varying needs of the individual school.
 
 
In addition to the Base Funding described above, schools in the Rescue Union School Distr
ict receive Supplemental funding 
roughly proportional to the number of unduplicated pupils (English Learners, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged, and 
Foster/Homeless Youth) they serve.  Furthermore, school sites receive allocations from other state and federa
l categorical 
programs, including Title I and Title II.  The purpose of these categorical programs range from improving the quality of the 
total instructional program for all students to addressing the unique needs of special groups of students.
