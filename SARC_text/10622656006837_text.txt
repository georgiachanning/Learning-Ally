About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Pl
anned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Publi
c School Construction. The results of this survey are available at the KCUSD Business Office. Riverview 
School's most recent facilities inspection was complete in December, 2019.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the ef
forts made to ensure that students are provided with a clean, safe, and 
functional learning environment. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by spe
aking with the school 
principal.
 
 
Riverview School has 19 c
lassrooms, a multipurpose room, a new student center
 
(completed in November 2009), a library (updated and expanded in 
2010)
 
and an administration building. The main campus was built in 1960. Additional relocatable classrooms were constructed in 1990
 
and 19
98. During 
the summer of 2018, improvements were made to parking lot, front of school, and the campus was painted. A solar parking struc
ture and shade structure 
were added in the summer of 2019.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessar
y to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
The Director of Maintenance, Custodial Supervisor, 
and the site principals work cooperatively with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar f
or dollar basis to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components
. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
During the 2015 summer Bond Measure K allowed Riverview to receive new roofing, blacktops and basketball courts.
  
Riverview also gained a new 
storage shed.
 
 
The multi
-
purpose room received new flooring during the 2015 summer.
 
 
During the 2016 summer the Riverview Administration Building received a new roof.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Riverview Elementary School. Before, during, and after school, the campu
s is monitored by assigned 
staff. All visitors must sign in at the 
office and wear appropriate identification while on campus.
 
 
The comprehensive school safety plan is designed to assist in preparing for emergencies, managing emergency response efforts,
 
and maintaining a safe 
school environment. The plan requires 
identification of security needs, development of prevention and intervention techniques, evaluation of physical 
facilities, and communication with staff and students. Components of the plan include: child abuse reporting procedures, proc
edures for teacher 
notification of dangerous pupils, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress from school, sexual ha
rassment policies, and 
suspension and expulsion policies. The safety plan is reviewed annually, updated as needed, and fully compli
ant with federal and state regulations. The

For the 17
-
18 and 18
-
19 school years, staff studied researched based best instructional practices, learner engagement strategies, and les
son design to 
meet the needs of students performing below proficiency. Staff, grade level, and vertical team meetings also provide regular 
opportunities for 
professional collaboration, as do district data analysis and interpretation committee meetings. A p
rofessional learning community continues to meet 
throughout the school year to plan, implement, observe, and reflect on instructional strategies. The district provides early 
release of students every 
Wednesday to allow teachers time to reflect on the Cycle
 
of Inquiry, including review of student data, planning instruction, and collaboration. Teachers 
received specific training at the August Buy
-
Back days. District instructional coaches followed
-
up with additional training days, observations, modeling 
and fe
edback. Riverview administration also participated in this staff development. Administrators work on teams to observe their s
ite teachers and 
teachers at other sites to provide feedback.  All ELA teachers were trained throughout the year on "Write from the
 
Beginning and Beyond."  The "Write 
from the Beginning" training were held approximately one Wednesday each month for the last several years.   Several teachers 
also participated in NGSS 
training.
 
 
In 2019
-
2020 in addition to the district provided professi
onal development, Riverview staff participated in Autism Training and Safety Care Training.  We 
continue to focus on Collaborative Teams and data analysis to the individual student level.  School
-

data to 
drive the instruction during this time.  Four teachers have joined the NGSS team and participate in trainings and lesson stud
ies around Science.  
Riverview Elementary School continues to emphasize collaborative team building, assessment and data collection
, and effective teaching strategies in its 
professional development program. Staff, grade level, and vertical team meetings also provide regular opportunities for profe
ssional collaboration, as 
do district meetings. Teachers attend various conferences and 
workshops based on teacher needs. Buy

quality professional development and collaboration.  Wednesday early release days are utilized for Grade Level Collaboration 
Meetings and district Write

raining.
 
 
Riverview also continues to engage in Professional Learning Communities (PLCs), assessment and data collection, and effective
 
teaching strategies, with 
continuous monitoring of our significant subgroups: Students With Disabilities, English Langua
ge Learners, Hispanic, and Socio
-
economically 
Disadvantaged. To supplement student learning, the Riverview staff received training on ways to use "Thinking Maps" as an ins
tructional strategy.
