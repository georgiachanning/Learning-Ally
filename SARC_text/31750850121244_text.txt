School Description
 
Sunset Ranch Elementary School is one of sixteen schools in the Rocklin Unified School District. The 
school serves students in pre
-
kindergarten through sixth grades, with an enrollment of about 726. 
The school is located in the heart of Whitney Ranch in a 
very stable and supportive community that 
expresses its values toward education through a high level of parent participation. Sunset Ranch 
Elementary School opened in 2010 and is the newest school in the District. Melanie Patterson is 
the Principal, Cindy 
Camillucci is the Assistant Principal, and Roger Stock is the District 
Superintendent. The school staff strives to provide an exemplary learning environment. Academic 
achievement is certainly the primary focus of the school, but the staff also operates on 
the principle 
that a caring environment fosters self
-
esteem and individual development and is the best road 
toward achieving a well
-
rounded education. The students are able to approach all facets of their 
learning with confidence and the assurance that thi
s school is their home.
 
 
Our rules of conduct are realized internally, leading to self
-
directedness and initiative. Our school
-
wide Positive Behavior Intervention System (PBIS) model focus on "Coyotes, CAN": Cooperate, Are 
Safe, Never Give Up. Sunset Ranch
 
Elementary School welcomes the direct involvement of the 
community in our efforts. By working together, parents and staff create a safe and orderly learning 
environment in which students interact positively with others and are able to develop 
responsibili
ty, confidence, and self
-
esteem. Parents play very important roles in Sunset Ranch 
Elementary School through their active participation and involvement in School Site Council and 
the Parents/Teacher Club (PTC). They share information with classes about pro
fessional lives, teach 
special skills (art, music, and sports), work on school or playground improvements, conduct 
fundraisers and make donations. They regularly volunteer their services in the classrooms and the 
library. Sunset Ranch Elementary School has
 
become a focal point and center for students and the 
community.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or the district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Sunset Ranch Elementary School opened in August, 2010.  It is new construction and no changes or modifications have occurred 
due
 
to its state of the 
art construction.
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.  To assist in this effort, the d
istrict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Pu
blic School Construction.  District maintenance ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school 
sites in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient se
rvice and that emergency 
repa
irs are given the highest priority.
