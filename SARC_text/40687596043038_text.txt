About t
he SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Loc
al Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to
 
address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Grover Beach Elementary International Baccalaureate World School provides a safe, clean environment for learning. Built in 19
55 and modernized in 
1990, Grover Beach Elementary International Baccalaureate Candidate 
School is situated on 10.3 acres. The school buildings span 39,735 square feet, 
consisting of 29 classrooms, a library, computer lab, administrative offices, counseling offices, and a multipurpose room wit
h a kitchen. There is one large 
playground and blac
ktop area for students in grades 1
-
6 and a separate enclosed playground area for kindergarten students.
 
 
In addition to the Grover Beach Elementary International Baccalaureate World School buildings, the site houses state preschoo
l classes, three Special 
E
ducation preschool classes, and the District early intervention Speech and Language program.  Nine new modular classrooms and
 
a restroom  replaced 
existing classrooms housed in portable buildings in 2019.
 
 
Grover Beach Elementary International Baccalaureat
e World School is a closed campus. Many people visit the campus to volunteer in the classroom and 
participate in school events. Parents and visitors are welcomed and required to check
-

visit
ors are required to return to the school office upon departure. During lunch, recesses, and before and after school, adults s
upervise students and 
school grounds, such as the cafeteria and recreation area, to ensure a safe and orderly environment.
 
 
Safety 
concerns are the No. 1 priority of maintenance and operations. District maintenance supervisors are proactive and conduct ins
pections at school 
sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed 
in a timely manner. A work
-
order process 
is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The District maintenance staff
 
has indicated that 100 percent 
of all toilets on school grounds are in working order.
 
 
A 
team of custodians ensures classrooms, campus grounds, and restrooms are kept clean and safe. A scheduled maintenance program
 
is administered 
by Lucia Mar Unified School District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well maintained and provide 
a suitable learning environment. A 
summary of these standards is available at the school office or at the District office.

telephone message system, and postings on bulletin boards and 
the marquee. All written bulletins and newsletters are published in both English and Spanish, we we use online applications f
or our postings as well.
 
 
Parents and the community are very support
ive of the programs at Grover Beach Elementary as evidenced by survey data. Parents become involved in 

n of school activities, 
atte
nding parent education evenings, and chaperoning on field trips. Organized groups for parent involvement include the PTO, SSC
, and ELAC.  Parents 
and community members are also invited to school activities and events throughout the year. Events include Bac

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the District to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The Plan pr
ovides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes the following requireme
nts of SB 187 within their Safe School Plans: 
current status of school crime; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, both routine and emergency; policies r
elated to suspension and 
expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual harassment polic
y; provision of a schoolwide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and school 
employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and updates it as needed. Safety proced
ures, including elements of the Safe School Plan, are reviewed with school 
and District staff in the fall, at the start of each school year. This year our Safety Plan was reviewed and approved by our 
School Site Council (SSC) on 
October 22nd, 2019.  The In
jury, Illness & Prevention Plan was last updated and reviewed with school staff in August, 2019.

Career Technical Education Programs
 
The Board of Education realized that students have varying academic interests and aptitudes, and that they need to be better 
prepared for options other 
than a 
four
-
year university directly from high school, particularly in light of the rapidly changing workforce technology and employment 
environments in 
many industry sectors. Therefore, the Board of Education sought to support Programs of Study to ensure that al
l students graduating from the Lucia Mar 
Unified School District have the preparation necessary for success in any post
-
secondary pursuit, whether it is university studies, technical training, 
workforce placement, military enlistment, or service as a commu
nity volunteer. 
 
 
As vocational education evolved in the 21st century, it became known as Career Technical Education (CTE). Business owners, tr
ade union leaders and 
educators came together to change how occupational and technical subject matter were delivered in high school
, college and technical training 
environments. This resulted in the need to develop robust and rigorous curriculum provided in a cyclical continuum that engag
es participants in the most 
common tasks and skills required in a broad umbrella of employment opp
ortunities within a specific industry sector. High School Career Pathways provide 
the first two to three years of instruction and skill development in this scenario. 
 
 
Pathway programs in LMUSD are designed so that students are able to gain at least one in
dustry certification, or equivalent skill measurement, to provide 
a competitive advantage in the job market. Additionally, curriculum will coincide with community college career certificate a
nd associate degree 
programs in same/similar industry areas and i
n some cases allow students to earn college credit for their coursework while still in high school. This will 
shorten the time it takes students to earn post
-
secondary degrees/certificates and enter the skilled workforce. The California Department of Educa
tion 
gives guidance for the design of model CTE programs in their plan for Career Technical Education, which was adopted by the St
ate Board of Education in 
2008. 
 
 
The same quality program indicators were taken into consideration during the development of 
career pathway programs of study for LMUSD. Specifically, 
the focus of pathway preparation has been on assessing current programs and facilities, establishing relationships with indus
try members and assembling 
advisory committees for new programs, reviewin
g and developing curriculum, reviewing instructor training needs, determining outreach/communication 
needs, and researching funding options for new and existing pathway programs.

The Director of CTE provides direct support to instructors, pathway program
s, and site administration in the areas of curriculum, facility and equipment, 
postsecondary alignment, industry partnerships, and overall pathway focus. CTE teachers participate in professional developme
nt to stay up to date with 
changes in industry by at
tending workshops, conferences, and other training opportunities. Additionally, CTE instructors focus on pathway development 
and philosophy, which include California State CTE Frameworks and model standards, as well as funding legislation that affect
s the 
structural make up of 
CTE programs. This baseline of CTE supports has continued to improve annually in the support of current programs that are fun
ctioning well, retooling 
programs that have minor areas of weakness, building out viable pathways from progra
ms that currently function as a single course, and establish new 
programs where programs do not exist but there is a regional workforce need. 
 
 
Several CTE programs participate in Career Technical Student Organization (CTSO) activities and competitions thr
ough the Future Farmers of America 
(FFA), SkillsUSA, and HOSA. The Culinary Arts, Agriculture, Design, Visual, Media Arts, and Animation programs have all had r
egional contest student 
winners, who competed in the various categories at the state level. Indu
stry recognized certifications include CPR, First Aid, Food Handlers, Serv Safe, 
Adobe, and CAD. Students also have the opportunity to earn college credit toward a degree within their field of study and som
e pathways offering 
multiple college courses. Addi
tionally, students are able to build resumes and portfolios with unique projects that demonstrate their level of expertise 
with industry desired skills. Through continually expanding internship programs available in various pathways, students are a
ble to g
ain real world 
experience within their field of study that often times leads to employment.
