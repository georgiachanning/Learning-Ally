By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our community is generous and caring in an atmosphere where cooperation and respect is highly valued. Blue Oak 
Elementary School realizes the positive correlation between parent involvement and student success. For this reason, the 
school continually searc
hes for ways to involve parents and the community in the education of our students. The school 
greatly benefits from the supportive parents who participate in the following ways: Parent Teacher Association (PTA), 
School Site Council, Yearbook Committee, LC
AP Committee, School Advisory Committee, and Budget Advisory Committee. 
In addition, we have dedicated classroom volunteers that give their time in various ways on a regular basis. Parent teacher 
conferences are held six weeks into the school year and are 
well attended at all grade levels. Parents are also provided 
opportunities to engage with the school through parent engagement events such as PTA social events, Family Math 
Meetings, and Parenting with Love and Logic.

and emotional needs of our students, teacher clarity, teacher efficacy, and
 
data review related to formative and 
summative assessments to inform future instruction and student supports.
 
 
The district instructional coach works with teachers to provide in class coaching as well as support during instructional 
planning. The principa
l facilitates data driven meetings reviewing student performance levels as it ties to standards, claims 
and targets. Grade level teacher teams work with administration to collaborate and plan instruction to support areas of 
determined weakness.

the Teacher Induction Program (TIP).
