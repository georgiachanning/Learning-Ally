By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or
 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
pr
incipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Lugonia Elementary School is one of the oldest established school name
s in California. The root name "Lugo" is the family 
name of a prominent rancher who farmed "Lugonia," a large parcel north of Redlands. The current school location, built 
in 1956, is the 3rd such school building to bear the Lugonia name. The current site's
 
longevity has allowed up to 4 
generations of students bearing the same family name to receive their elementary education from Lugonia Elementary 
School. Students continue to enjoy much success, having their educational beginnings at a school rich in histo
ry and 
tradition.
 
 
Today, Lugonia Elementary School is one of 16 elementary schools in the Redlands Unified School District. It has a student 
population of approximately 710 students in grades K
-
5 and serve an approximate 75 preschoolers. Lugonia employs a
 
highly qualified and experienced team of educators and paraprofessionals. School personnel consists of 27 general 
education classroom teachers, one and a half Specialized Academic Instruction (SAI) teachers, two Special Day Class (SDC) 
teachers (all presc
hool), one state preschool teacher, an assistant principal, and a principal. A school psychologist, a speech 
therapist and an elementary counselor are members of the staff on a part
-
time basis. Lugonia children are also supported 
by the district enrichment
 
teachers in physical education, art and music. In addition to the teaching staff, there are six 
instructional assistants, one school office manager, one clerk typist, and a part
-
time healthy start clerk and three 
intervention teachers.
 
 
The PreK
-
5 educati
onal program follows the RUSD Board Adopted core curriculum. Faculty use school wide strategies that 
successfully help students develop skills in reading, writing, and math through active problem solving. We also provide an 
environment which develops self
-
worth, confidence, and character via PBIS (Positive Behavior Interventions) program.
 
 
Lugonia staff works as a Professional Learning Community focusing on student learning. Each Wednesday teachers meet 
in collaborative groups to review current student achi
evement data to develop standards
-
based lessons, re
-
teach 
opportunities, and extension activities depending on the learning need of each child. By using brain
-
based instructional 
practices students master grade level essential standards as outlined in our 
school mission below.
 
 
An early childhood educational program was established on site during the 2001
-
2002 school year. It is comprised of two 
state preschool programs for 3 and 4
-
year
-
old students.
 
 
Lugonia offers intervention both during and after the sc
hool school which is available for students who need extra support 
in reading, math, and/or English language development. Lugonia has partnered with Clement Middle School and Redlands 
High School to establish a cross
-
age tutoring program to support our stu
dents. Additionally, we have developed a 
community partnership with The River Church as well as to provide tutoring support, intramural sports and community 
events.
 
 
Appreciation is extended to our volunteers, donors, and collaborators who include: Redland
s Rotary who provides 
Breakfast and a Book once a month to foster reading in the home; The Assistance League of Redlands supports Lugonia's 
families by providing basic school supplies and clothing when needed; The University of Redlands who provides us wit
h 
America Reads tutors; The River church supports Lugonia by with intramurals and tutors; Loma Linda Dental offers on
-
site 
dental care for uninsured families; Healthy Start and Building A Generation are a resource to a myriad of services for 
students and f
amilies in need; and, United Way who provides identified students with "Weekend Nutrition Back
-
Packs."

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
School and staff work hard to keep the campus clean and safe. All school facilities are in good repair, and a litter/graffiti
-
f
ree environment is emphasized to students and staff. None of the eight emergency facilities needs specified in Education 
Code Section 17592.72 exist.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of our school and the efforts made to continue ensure
 
that students 
are provided with a clean safe and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School/Buildings:
 
Built in 1956, Lugonia Elementary school has 25 permanent classrooms. Since that time, there have been many changes 
including the addition of 8 rel
ocatable classrooms have been made to the original school to accommodate more students 
and to beautify the campus.
 
 
Maintenance and Repairs:
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order a
re 
completed in a timely manner. The governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in RUSD. A summary 
of these standards is available at the school office, at the District Office, or at www.redlands.k12.ca.us. The principal wor
ks 
daily wit
h the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school. A work order process is used 
to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The District maintenance staff has 
indicated 100% of 
all toilets on school grounds are in working order during their last inspection done on November, 2018.
 
 
Cleaning process and Schedule:
 
School site custodians clean bathrooms and preschool classrooms daily. Kinder through grade 5 classrooms are cleaned 
on 
an odd/even schedule (with trash emptied daily). The school district provides a grounds crew who work at Lugonia on 
a rotating schedule.
 
 
Modernization Projects:
 
During the school year 2004
-
2005, local bond funds from Measure K were used at Lugonia. The ap
pearance of our school 
has been enhanced by painting, additional landscaping, new playground equipment and a new shade structure. The 
classrooms, library, computer lab, and multipurpose room were freshly painted, new carpeting was installed, and 
classrooms
 
received new white boards and additional bulletin board space. The entire school's computer/internet access 
has been updated with multiple access points for computers installed in each classroom. In addition, a new VoIP telephone 
system was installed. The
 
new system provides a PA system for the school and a telephone with voice mail for all staff. In 
2008
-
2009, Measure J Funds were used at Lugonia to provide additional fencing, security cameras, and parking lot 
improvements.  In 2018
-
2019 the entire school
 
received new carpeting as well as new flooring in the cafeteria.  The entire 
school's computer/internet access was also updated through enhanced wireless access points and the the lighting on 
campus was updated.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Lugonia Elementary School utilizes data from its California Safe School Assessment and suspension/expulsion reports to 
evaluate
 
the current status of school crime. A Safe School Plan is adopted in March of each school year and is reflective of 
the school's safety needs. The key components of Lugonia's Safe School Plan include a description of school discipline 
policies and procedu
res, dress code guidelines, suspension and expulsion policies, sexual harassment policies, child abuse 
reporting procedures, dangerous pupil notification, and disaster response procedures. The site assistant principal 
coordinates student behavior supports,
 
supervises the preschool programs, and facilitates community support services to 
meet student needs.

School Safety
 
To ensure student safety before school, campus monitors, teachers, and administrators supervise the school grounds 
including the cafeteria 
and playground. During the school day all entrance areas are locked with the exception of the front 
entrances located near the administrative office.  The raptor system is also utilized with anyone who visits our campus.   
Signs are posted throughout the c
ampus to indicate all visitors must report to the administrative office and may not be 
on school grounds unless the person has a visible Raptor pass. A specially trained group of 4th and 5th graders, the 
"ROARing Leaders" as well as our Elementary Counselo
r work individually with certain students who may be experiencing 
problems with classmates.
 
 
Lugonia's boundaries allow students to walk to and from school. Two crossing guards stationed on two different streets 
ensure students cross the street safely. Cam
pus monitors, teachers, and administrators supervise the area until all 
students have left the campus for home. Some Special Day Class students ride the bus.

ates in four categorically funded programs: School Improvement Program (SIP);ESEA Title I; Title III; 
and EIA/LEP
 
 
School Improvement Program (SIP)
 
This is a state funded program for all students, kindergarten through fifth grade. The funds from this progr
am are used to 
provide supplemental materials and educational opportunities for students.
 
 
ESEA Title I
 
Title I is a federally funded program for students in grades K

5. Lugonia services all students with funds from Title I. Title I 
funds support intervent
ion teachers, additional campus monitor support for school safety, parent involvement activities, 
supplemental instructional materials, professional development, and other intervention programs to enrich the students 
academic careers.
 
 
EIA/LEP (Limited Eng
lish Proficiency)
 
LEP funds are provided on the basis of enrollment of students who demonstrate limited proficiency in English. These funds 
provide for services to English Learners to help them acquire English as a second language and grade level proficien
cy in 
all content areas. As a result our EL intervention teachers' salary, a portion of staff professional development; parent 
workshops; and supplemental classroom materials are funded through LEP funds.
