By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Hanshaw Middle School is located in the southwest section of Modesto, California. Hanshaw is one of four comprehensive 
junior high schools in Modesto City School system. Our enrollment consists of 901 7th and 8th g

student population consists of the following feeder schools: Bret Harte, Fairview, Robertson Road, Shackelford, and 
Tuolumne.
 
 
Our instructional program is a blend of academic and enrichment classes that help students prepare for h
igh school and 
higher learning. Students are scheduled into academic classes: Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, History Social 
Science, and Physical Education. An extra period of Language Arts and/or Mathematics Support is offered to students in 
need of
 
additional support and who have scored basic or below on the California State Test. In addition, students who are 
English Learners will be scheduled into an Academic Language Development (ALD) or Read180 class. Our ALD classes 
strategically focus on teach
ing students academic language, vocabulary, intensive writing strategies, and building prior 
and background knowledge. Our Read180 classes are a comprehensive reading and writing system of curriculum, 
instruction, assessment, and professional development p
roven to raise reading achievement for struggling readers for any 
student reading two or more years below grade
-
level. Hanshaw also has the Dual Language Academy (DLA) for 7th and 
8th graders to help them be proficient in both English and Spanish. These st
udents have been enrolled in the DLA beginning 
in elementary school and will to continue learning in both English and Spanish in their social studies class and as well as i
n 
a Spanish language arts class taught in Spanish.
 
 
Three Special Education programs
 
offered at Hanshaw are Resource, Learning Handicapped and Severely Handicapped 
classes. Our Resource course is designed to assist students with assignments and instruction from general education 
classes, using their goals from their Individualized Educati
on Plans (IEP). The Learning Handicapped course is designed 

modifications of the curriculum. Lastly, the objective of our Severely Handica
pped course provides students with 
functional academic skills using adaptive state standards as well as working on life skills.
 
 
For enrichment, students can ballot for one of the following elective classes: Introduction to Computer Technology, 
Woodshop, A
VID, Life Skills, Leadership, Guitar and Band. Students gain additional support through our After

paths and/or extracurricular a
ctivities.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
 
We believe ALL students can learn in a safe environment, designed to ensure fu
ture success in a highly connected world. 
We expect all members of the Hanshaw School community to treat each other with dignity and respect. Students will 
attend school, be prepared, and ready to learn. ALL community members will collaborate as a team to 
create and sustain 
this academic
 
 
learning environment at Hanshaw. We will celebrate the academic and social growth of our Hanshaw community

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of 
this survey are included within this report. The results of this survey are available at the district office and on the inter
net 
at mcs4kids.com.
 
 
Lakewood School is proud to provide a safe haven for children and strictly follows the District's guidelines 
for school safety, 
discipline, and drug prevention. Lakewood School has been part of the Safe Schools Project. Campus Club childcare is 
offered before and after school. All staff have been issued Lakewood School MCS identification badges. All visitors are 
required to sign in/out and pick up a guest sticker. The principal and staff monitor the parking lot in the morning and 
afternoon on a daily basis. The School's Safety Committee is comprised of the principal, staff, and parents. Lakewood 
School has a close
d parking lot monitored by our student safety patrol and staff. The campus is closed after 6:30 pm on 
the weekdays and on the weekends. Lakewood staff works with community members who are interested in using the 
facilities before and after school. The Safe
ty Plan and Emergency Crisis Plan are modified yearly and as needed. These 
plans include procedures for school safety issues, release of students, and all emergency drills. Regular Safety Committee 
meetings are scheduled at the school site. This committee 
responds to student, parent and staff
-
generated safety 
concerns. Office personnel update the Crisis Response Kit annually. The school nurse maintains records and provides in
-
services of student health care plans to teachers, students, secretaries, and the 
principal.

number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Asse
ssment plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., 
achieved Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they receiv
ed a score or not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Hanshaw continues its PBIS components to decrease negative behaviors on campus. We also have three campus 
supervisors to help supervise the campus and school crisis (emergency) procedures (including predetermined evacuation 
routes and location and lock dow
n procedures). Teachers are provided with a Safety and Emergency Reference guide that 
indicates the Campus Emergency Action Plan. The Safety Plan is reviewed and approved by the Safety committee each 
year. We also share the most common emergency procedures
 
that we will encounter in a given year: Lockdown, 
Evacuation, Secure Campus, and the Drop, Duck, Cover and Hold On. At the end of the day, staff monitor the front gate 
along with a campus supervisor and 1 or more safety officers to ensure students are bei
ng picked up safely and that traffic 
flows in a safe general direction.
 
When the Safety Committee meets the parents are notified via a phone dialer. Our Site Specific Dress code is also included 
in that folder. We review the dress code with all the social 
studies classes when the conduct code is reviewed.
 
School area pedestrian safety plan: Students are encouraged to use the buddy system; use designated crossing areas to 
cross the street; avoid the canals; not walk down middle of the street; and, not accept
 
ride from strangers.
 
Safety hotline implementation plan: the number is disseminated and distributed to the staff, students and kids are made 
aware from posters posted around school. Supervision staff checks the messages weekly.

Professional development in MCS is data driven using research
-
based best practices to ensure our students receive 
guaranteed and viable curriculum in every grade, in every school.    We use formative and summative data to drive our 
instructional decisions 
and focus for professional development.  To this end, we utilize multiple structures  to provide 
high
-
quality professional development to our staff including:  summer training, preservice
-
days, district wide professional 
development days, after school work
shops, Saturday workshops, substitute
-
release days, instructional coaching, a BTSA 
and PAR program,  and most recently a 0.5% compensation package for those who choose to complete an extra 6 hours 
of professional development.
 
 
MCS has prioritized our focus
 
on mathematics, literacy across grades and content areas, collaboration, welcoming 
schools/customer service, and building our capacity as professionals.  This has been in addition to the needed training in 
new adoptions, curriculum and standard updates an
d the like.  The professional development is sustained through site 
administration, district and site level instructional coaches, and intervention specialists.  In the 2019
-
202 academic year, 
a new division was also created in order to increase the qualit
y and quantity of professional development provided to 
classified, certificated, and managers alike.
