By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

success, but are equally proud of how our students continue to succeed after leaving Wilson School.
 
 
To 
encourage high academic learning and positive social behavior, our Students of the Month program is based equally 
on academic subjects and character traits.  Students chosen for this honor are recognized at our monthly Board of 
Education meetings.  Student
s are also recognized by teachers at our weekly assembly for displaying good character traits 

part of the story.
 
 
We invite you to visit
 
Wilson School to see how our small learning community is a wonderful place for children to grow 
into responsible, thoughtful, educated, confident, healthy and happy community members.  When you visit, you will see 
how a small, rural school is preparing it
s students to become intelligent, hardworking, emotionally and mentally strong, 
compassionate and responsible 21st century citizens.
 
 
School Mission Statement:
 
We, the Wilmar Union Elementary School District, in partnership with our parents and our communi
ty lay the foundation 


emic 
potential.  We create a safe, caring environment in which children can develop well
-
rounded interests and where they 
learn to respect and value others as contributing members of a community that supports a life
-
long love of learning.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Wilson Elementary School was established in 1863.  Our c
urrent buildings were erected in 1957, modernized in 2003 and 
remodeled in 2015.  The school has 11 regular classrooms, a library, computer lab, multipurpose room, and three portable 
classrooms used for instruction.  Physical Education/play facilities incl
ude three playgrounds (TK & Kindergarten, 1st
-
3rd 
grades and 4th
-
6th grades), a soccer/football field, and a baseball field with a track around it that is ADA accessible.
 
 
In March of 2010 Wilson Elementary School completed a mile
-
long water pipeline proje
ct to bring Petaluma City drinking 
water to the school.  The water project was an eleven
-
year pursuit to bring drinking water from the City of Petaluma to 
Wilson School.  We now have a reliable source of drinking water and only use our well water for irrig
ation.  The Wilson 
School Water Project was paid for by Federal and State funds through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 
2009.
 
 
In November 2012, our community voted to pass Measure P to bring needed funds to upgrade and remodel our 
facilities 
and to improve our technology infrastructure.  In the summer of 2014 Bond work was completed to replace a major 
portion of our sewer system, to expand and remodel our main office and to replace the louvered windows in all 
classrooms.  During the
 
summer of 2015, every regular classroom was remodeled with new flooring, new wall coverings 
and new ceiling tiles.  Insulation was added to the ceiling to make the school more energy efficient.  In the 2017
-
18 school 
year we have converted all of our ligh
ting to LED lights and plan to add Solar Power to our campus in 2019
-
20.
 
 
All facilities are kept in safe and clean condition.  Buildings and grounds are clean and routinely inspected, maintained, 
repaired or upgraded as needed.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

At Wilson School, parents are 
encouraged to take an active role in the life of the school, and we are pleased to have many 
parent volunteers.  We have strong community support through the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) as well as with 
active parent involvement in the classroom, on fi
eld trips, during extra curricular activities, and with campus 
beautification. PTA fundraisers such as our annual walk
-
a
-
thon and school festivals provide additional funds for various 
school improvements, student field trips and community activities. Some 
of the special events are the Gifts from the Heart 
craft day where each student can hand make several gifts for family members during the holidays, the Daughters' Ball and 
the Mother & Son camp out. After school programs include enrichment classes, sports,
 
and after school child care.  Wilson 
community events give parents opportunities for leadership and input into the goals and activities of the school. The 

mbers with the 
staff and students. We strive to identify and to connect with the resources of our learning community in both formal and 
informal ways. Adults and older students are welcome to be involved in our classrooms, on our playground, and in all 
sup

social mentoring, school garden, and a wide variety of others. Formally, our PTA and School Site Council seek the 
involvement of parents and 
other community members. We recently partnered with Mentor Me, a local organization to

school uses the Professional Learning Community (PLC) approach where teachers and administration work collaboratively 
to choose the focus for staff development.  We continue to focus on teaching s
trategies that support 21st Century Skills 
of: Critical Thinking, Communication, Collaboration, and Creativity.
 
 
All teachers are also encouraged to participate in workshops, conferences, and other training that will enhance 
instructional practices. Teache
rs give reports to the whole faculty from the training they attend.
 
 
Teachers new to the profession participate in the North Coast Teacher Induction Program (NCTIP), designed to support 
new teachers through training and individual coaching.
 
 
During the 201
