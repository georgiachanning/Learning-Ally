By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg

.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
It is the mission of Holly Avenue and the Arcadia Unified School District to provide quality work which is engaging, results 
in students learning meaningful content, and challenges every student to learn more. Holly Avenue
 
is an excellent place 
for a child to be educated. The school employs a highly dedicated teaching staff of outstanding quality and professionalism. 
The variety of talent among the teachers, as well as their commitment to excellence, provides an exciting le
arning 
atmosphere for the students at our school.  We provide a high
-
quality, comprehensive educational program for all 
students in a safe but challenging environment.  Teachers use Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) strategies 
to help student
s learn, differentiate instruction and prepare students for the future. Students are encouraged to develop 
socially, emotionally, physically, and intellectually. We are committed to preparing and motivating our students to become 
lifelong learners and prod
uctive citizens who can contribute to a global society. This is accomplished through the 
cooperative efforts of educators, support staff, parents, community members, and students. The staff at Holly Avenue 
Elementary School has created an excellent instruc
tional program based on California Academic Standards. Our vision is 
to prepare students academically in a way that balances skill development with critical and complex thinking skills, 
encourages creative thinking, and maximizes individual student's stren
gths.
 
 
At Holly Avenue, teachers build capacity and strive to make a profound impact.  We recognize and celebrate our 
differences. Our teachers work diligently to ensure that we instill growth mindsets in our students and that we provide all 
students with 
the best individualized instruction possible so that they are prepared to become contributing citizens in a 
global community. We believe in collective efficacy with embedded weekly collaboration time where we discuss student 
growth, visible learning, and i
mpact through the lens of Multiple Tiered System of Support (MTSS). Under the umbrella of 
MTSS, teachers implement a number of Tier I and Tier II supports. The focus on effective classroom feedback (task, 
process, self
-
regulation, self) and visible learnin
g have strengthened instruction and enhanced learning. We emphasize 
universally designed learning environments and support our classrooms with varying furniture and even different lighting 
depending upon needs. Through our many discussions on MTSS and Univ
ersal Design for Learning (UDL), we recognize the 
importance of inclusion and the need for Social
-
Emotional Learning (SEL). By looking at data and discussing best teaching 
practices, we defined our desired outcome 
-
 
success for ALL students. As the curricu
lum intensifies, our new English 
Language Development (ELD) students and special education students, as well as some students not in special programs, 
sometimes struggle to perform at the proficient level. Teachers constantly reevaluate their instructional
 
strategies to meet 
the needs of all students while working closely with families and collaborating together on a weekly basis. In addition to 
support within the classroom, our school has a Literacy for All program where general education students receive 
targeted 
instruction in English Language Arts.  We also offer math camps and teach Number Talks to support students in math. 
Because having a safe environment for students to learn in is essential, we are committed to SEL. Teachers are trained on 
Restorati
ve Practices, and community circles are used frequently. We established relaxation stations within our 
classrooms so that students have accessible and integrated spaces where they can go to reset. Our counselor teaches 
lessons such as Second Step and Kimoc
his. District transition counselors work with fifth graders as they transition to middle 
school. We strive to provide a natural setting that fosters positive relationships. Caring adults play an important role in 
building strong relationships with students
 
and in facilitating student connection to school.

As a community, we work diligently to be proactive and have consequently seen growth in our students, both socially and 
emotionally. Additionally, we teach students the importance of leadership and of con
tributing to their community.  
Through the implementation of the Leader in Me Habits and AVID strategies, we nurture student leaders. All students 
have the opportunity to take on leadership roles, and we have many student
-
created clubs. Students are also m
entors. 
General education students often help students with moderate disabilities in our special education classes. Primary 
students are paired with upper grade level students in special buddy classes. It is not unusual to find fifth grade students 
reading
 
to kindergartners or helping them create writing projects on their 1:1 Chromebooks.  We also have high school 
buddies that come to our school for cross
-
age reading and P.E. We recognize that not every family has the same financial 
resources, so we have de
veloped many programs that provide exposure to our students. Through a grant from the United 
States Tennis Association, we teach our 5th graders how to play tennis and we built an outside exercise area. We offer 
instrumental music for all upper graders, an
d we work with a nonprofit organization to provide visual arts. The use of 1:1 
devices within all classrooms also supports student learning. After school, students have additional opportunities, such as 
being part of drama and garden club and learning Kung
 
Fu or Mandarin. Community support plays an important role in 
the success of our students. The Parent Teacher Association (PTA) is supportive and helps with outreach. Every month 
they offer free family activities, such as STEAM night.  Our PTA meetings inc
lude guest speakers to help educate and 

just arriving in the United States. Our Academic Program Coach (APC) and Math Specialist offer 
trainings focusing on 
reading, writing, and math support.  Our Transitional Kindergarten teacher reaches out to families and trains them on how 
to support our youngest scholars at home.  We see this community as an extended family, and our dedicated staff 
wants 
the best for every child. Holly Avenue is a caring and academically
-
enriched school.  We are so fortunate to have a staff 
and community that works so well with each other.  We not only educate our students to ensure that they are meeting 
academic sta
ndards, but we focus on the whole child.  We encourage students to explore, work together, ask questions, 
and be engaged in their own learning.  Our goal is to create strong leaders who are prepared to work in a global society.  
Holly Avenue has been recog
nized with several awards, including: California Distinguished School Award, the AVID Teacher 
Advocacy Award, and a Leader in Me Leadership Award.  We are proud of all our students and accomplishments.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Holly Avenue Elementary School is
 
a beautiful early
-
California
-
style school. Built in 1926, it is the oldest elementary school 
in the district. Modular buildings have been added to the site. The school was modernized in 1995 and again in 2009

2010. It provides a safe and clean environment
 
for students, staff, and parents. The school employs two full
-
time 
custodians and one part
-
time custodian who maintain the facilities and ensure classrooms, restrooms, and campus 
grounds are kept safe and clean. The district also administers a scheduled m
aintenance program. Children participate in 
the beautification of the school site.
 
 
In recent years Holly completed major improvements and construction including a new three
-
classroom building, 
reconstruction of student
-
support offices, updated 
classrooms, and fencing surrounding the school buildings and fields. 
Air conditioning was added to the cafeteria and auditorium. Upgrades are thanks to a large bond issue passed by the City 
of Arcadia. Summer of 2017 deferred maintenance projects consistin
g of roofing maintenance to several buildings and 
exterior painting were completed. In 2018, a fitness equipment playground area was installed, along with an artificial turf 
surface;  the carpet flooring in Room 20 was replaced; and several window panes we
re replaced.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic

Holly Avenue 
encourages volunteering and our volunteers are highly valued. Many parents work in the classroom; they 
present and read with students, prepare material for teachers for use at school and for students at home, and they are 
also important chaperones on field
 
trips. We have many ways for parents to participate in the daily activities at our school 
and we appreciate all their contribution. Parents are members of our School Site Council (SSC), an important committee 
that reviews student data and develops our sch
ool improvement plan for student achievement. Parents of English Learners 
are vital to our English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) and to our outreach efforts on behalf of new families. We offer 
Latino Literacy classes to our Spanish speaking community a
nd newcomers' meeting for families that are new to this 
country.  Parents in the Holly Avenue community are engaged and well informed. They are interested in the school and 
are actively involved and proud of its accomplishments. We ask all parents to atten
d Back
-
to
-
School Night in the fall, Open 
House in the spring, holiday program, and student
-
led conferences in October and February. Parents are crucial partners 

 
 
Our active PTA provides support for our school. Many parent and
 
community volunteers help in the classrooms with 
special projects, serving on special committees like organizing our STEAM Night,  Legislative Action, and helping with 
school activities and fundraising. Our PTA hosts many events for parents. Some events i
nclude: Donuts with Dads, Muffins 
with Mom, Father
-
Daughter Dance, Mother
-
Son Bowling, and Movie Nights. In addition, they help with meet and greet 
events such as the first day coffee, Kindergarten Round
-
up, and our Welcome Back Picnic.  All parents are in
vited to attend 
monthly PTA meetings that include guest speakers to help inform and educate them. The Arcadia Educational Foundation 
consists of parents and community members and raises funds from the overall community to support selected 
instructional pro
grams. It has provided funding for new technology, and several Holly Avenue teachers have been awarded 
mini
-
grants.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
To safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, a Comprehensive School Safety Plan has been developed by the Safety 
and Disaster Committee, which consists of classified staff, teachers, and the principal. The committee sets goals for the 
school to conti
nually improve in 3 areas: School Climate (Students, Parents, and Programs), Emergency Preparedness 
(Disasters and Crisis), and School Environment (Facilities and Campus). The plan addresses various safety issues, including 
creating procedures that detect 
and prevent bullying, ensuring appropriate campus supervision, maintaining disaster kits, 
and monitoring emergency procedures. The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is updated each year and approved by the 
School Site Council and the Board of Education.  Th
e plan is reviewed with all staff members at the beginning of each 
school year. Safety drills are held on a regular basis; fire drills are held monthly, earthquake drills are held four times a
 
year, and intruder/lockdown drills are held at least once a yea
r. Staff members also receive disaster training on a regular 
basis.
 
 
To ensure student safety, teachers, administrators, and school proctors supervise students on campus before and after 
school, and during breaks and lunch. Holly Avenue Elementary School h
as a closed campus, and permission is always 

office and must wear the proper identification badge at all times.

Under the curre
nt Local Control Funding Formula, districts like Arcadia Unified School District, with low numbers of 
unduplicated students receive far less ongoing money to implement the California Academic Standards compared to 
neighboring districts with greater numbers
 

youth).  These high unduplicated count districts receive supplemental and concentration grant monies to purchase 
materials, hire consultants, and pay for hours of professional
 
development for their instructional and student support 
staffs.
 
 
In the Fall of 2013, the Arcadia Unified School District negotiated an interest
-
based solution for California Academic 
Standards implementation with its bargaining units to add three days to
 
the school calendar for two years starting in the 
2014
-
15 school year. Negotiations produced an agreement to spread the three days of additional paid time over seven 
early release days with development time of 2.5 hours per day built into the schedule.  S
ince 2015, AUSD leadership has 
negotiated annual agreements with its bargaining units to continue the additional three days for professional 
development.

TAC is a representative group made up of bargaining unit 
members and management team members who were charged with serving as an advisory committee to the District in the 
imple
mentation of the district
-
wide California Academic Standards Collaboration Time supporting TK
-
12 instructional 
programs both vertically and horizontally, as they made dramatic instructional and curricular shifts.
 
 
The commitment from both our bargaining un
its and management was to build research
-
based professional development 
around small collaborative working groups. Each group would be designed intentionally to have a vertical alignment of 
teachers from TK
-
12 engaged in the work together.
 
 
In late Spring 
of 2014, the C
-
TAC committee reached out to all certificated staff to assist with generating ideas for the 
content of the Collaboration Days. The committee, after reviewing and discussing the many ideas that were submitted 
and looking at survey data, gener
ated a list of themes which became the foundation of the Collaboration Days and assisted 
in guiding the development of a Course Group Catalogue. The planning of the Collaboration Days was research based, 
focused on meaningful work, teacher choice, flexibil
ity, and ongoing commitment. The Professional Development was 
designed around teacher interests that included creating autonomous choice for teachers and support providers in 
relation to where they felt they could best contribute their training, talents, i
nterests, and education, by participating in 
Small Working Groups (SWaG) and engaging with other professionals to continue the real work of implementing the 
California Academic Standards.  C
-
TAC continues to act as the advisory body for the Collaboration D
ays, reviewing survey 
data and requests for course offerings, and considering suggestions for improvements to the program.

Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) conferences, Thinking Maps, and Write From the Beginning, in support of California 
Academic Standards implementation, Illuminate data and as

Generation Science Standards. At the high school level, data indicated that a large segment of potentially college
-
bound 
students were not being provided access and opportunity to pursue honors and colleg

-
level courses, as their high
-
achieving classmates were. Leadership worked with teachers to engage in professional development around the themes 
of Advanced Placement (AP) open access and equity for all students over the past two years. Professional Devel
opment 
resources have been designated to send teachers, counselors and leadership to the local and regional College Board/A.P. 
Forums. Continued professional development will be pursued at the national level.
 
 
Full implementation of the Advancement Via Ind
ividual Determination (AVID) program continues to be a focus of 
professional development dollars over the past seven years.
 
 
Individual school sites have been
 
tasked with working with the Instructional Coaches to conduct professional development 
around the themes of the California Academic  Standards, including rigor, focus, coherence, instructional strategies, shifts 
in curriculum, pacing and instructional mat

have become regional professional development leaders by presenting at conferences and through their instituting the 
San Gabriel Valley Instructional Coaches Consortium.
 
 
Staff development topics from 2012
