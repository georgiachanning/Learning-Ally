About the SARC
 
By Fe
bruary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fu
nding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
stat
e and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Professional learning in La Mesa
-
Spring Valley continues evolving to cultivate capacity and efficacy of teachers so that they can ensure high levels of 
learning for each and every student. In recent years professional learning has emphasized developing a c
ommon language around high quality teaching 
and learning and building collaborative cultures that promote high levels of learning for all students through professional l
earning communities. This 
work has included a deeper dive into content standards throug
h the selection of essential standards and discussions around mastery and effective 
assessment. In response to student performance data and classroom observation, current professional learning focuses on align
ing instruction to 
standards and student experi
ence, with extra time and resources dedicated to mathematics and English learners.
 
 
New for the 2019
-
20 school year is our Blended Professional Development program which will offer online professional development options while
 
still 
offering 
face
-
to
-
face professional development. Some of the professional learning that we will offer includes: Igniting ELD multi
-
year seminars where 
teachers learn and implement strategies for designated and integrated ELD and using formative assessment to guide s
tandards
-
based instruction, Mindful 
Math where participants will develop deeper understandings of math teaching and how to enrich it while making the District ma
th curriculum more 
accessible to their students, and ProAct, which teaches participants techniq
ues they can use to deescalate a child's behavior.  Additional professional 
development continues to address professional learning communities, curriculum adoptions, differentiation, special education,
 
NGSS and effective 
integration of technology into inst
ruction.
 
 
With professional learning communities as a foundation, professional development is approached from multiple angles to ensure
 
that it is relevant, 
timely, and targeted to both student and teacher needs. Teachers meet weekly, as a grade level or d
iscipline, to analyze student data and discuss best 
practices to address the needs of each and every student.
 
 
The district offers workshops and multiple
-
day seminars, after
-
school workshops, online courses, and one
-
on
-
one coaching and modeling. Select tea
chers 
also attend conferences and workshops offered through outside agencies.  District staff also partners with principals providi
ng professional development 
at site learning days and staff meetings.
