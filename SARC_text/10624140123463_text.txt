By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Sanger Unified retains an independent contractor to provide comprehensive facilities inspection of every school site. This 
inspection meets or exceeds the criteria of the State of California Williams inspection requirement. The Williams 
compliance inspect
ions are done by Fresno County Office of Education (FCOE). Only one SUSD site is inspected by Fresno 
County Office of Education annually for Williams compliance. This site is not a FCOE inspected site. The most recent 
inspection, either district or William
s, available when this SARC is prepared is utilized for this report. Inspection reports 
are maintained at the SUSD District Office.
 
 
The rating scale used for this inspection is as follows:
 
 
99% 
-
 
100% = Exemplary: School meets most/all standards of 
good repair. Noted deficiencies, if any, are not significant.
 
 
90% 
-
 
98.99% = Good: School maintained in good repair with some isolated deficiencies from wear/tear or are being 
mitigated.
 
 
75% 
-
 
89.99% = Fair: School is not in good repair with some critica
l or widespread deficiencies and repairs are necessary.
 
 
00% 
-
 
74.99% = Poor: School facilities are in poor condition with deficiencies of various degrees throughout and major 
repairs are necessary.
 
 
The results of the most recent report available for this
 
campus are disaggregated below.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school site has a Safe School Plan that is reviewed and updated annually.  Plans are reviewed with staff annually often 
at the beginning of each School 
Year.   Our School Site Council (SSC) approves our SafeSchool Plan.  Emergency drills are 
conducted to prepare students and staff in the event of an emergency.  We strive to maintain a safe,healthful, nurturing 
and orderly school campus that encourages pos
itive attitudes in students and staff.  A joint effort between students and 
staff help keep the campus clean and litter free.  Site maintenance staffs survey their campus as the first order of business
 
each day.They insure the campus is clean, any vandalis
m is corrected, and that the campus is presentable and 
representative of the priority Sanger School Board sets on safety and appearance.  Oversight of Sanger Unified Safe School 
Plans is through the Director of Support Services.  Sequoia's Safe School Plan
 
was reviewed with site staff in September 
2019.

What are the primary/major areas of focus for staff development and specifically how were they selected? For example, 
were student achievement data used to determine the need for professional development in reading instruction?
 
 
All of
 
our professional development is based on the needs of our students and teachers, assessed through observations, 
surveys, disaggregation of SBAC data, PBIS data and other assessment data. Teachers in Sanger Unified have completed 
professional training cour
ses designed to support educational priorities and objectives. Staff Development Days are 
designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for administrators, teachers and classified personnel.
 
 
What are the methods by which professional development i
s delivered (e.g., after school workshops, conference 
attendance, individual mentoring, etc.)?
 
 
As a district, we are committed to offering teachers a variety of professional learning opportunities and options for 
personalized professional development. San
ger Unified provides professional learning in all subjects (Math, STEAM, ELA, 
ELD, assessments etc.) for TK
-
6th grade teachers throughout the school year. For single
-
subject teachers, Sanger Unified 
provides two to four full days of training dedicated to s
pecific initiatives, strategies and frameworks (Balanced Literacy, 
Guaranteed and Viable Instruction, ELD, Writing, Speaking and Listening, Close Reading, Project Based Learning, Universal 
Design for Learning, etc.) Sanger Unified also offers after
-
school 
workshops on various math instructional strategies and 
routines, after
-
school technology trainings and Universal Design for Learning trainings. Each year, we offer a district 
conference where teachers share their best practices with one another. Teacher le
aders at all sites are given a variety of 
opportunities to attend national and state conferences and seminars, as to further the collective knowledge of all 
members of their grade level teams and learning communities. Teachers also have the opportunity to 
engage in 
personalized professional development through instructional coaching.

New to the profession Teachers are also supported through the Sanger Unified School District Beginning Teacher Support 
and Assessment Induction Program (BTSA) and New Teacher 
Support. A teacher that is teaching under a PIP or STSP, or is 
an Intern is assigned a mentor that provides the new teacher with a minimum of 4 hours per week of direct or indirect 
support for his/her individualized professional growth. In addition, the te
achers attend required professional development 
provided by the district and school site. New teachers that have a preliminary credential participate in our formal BTSA 
Induction Program. Teachers participating in BTSA receive support from a trained suppor
t provider for two years. The

teachers, along with their mentors (support providers) attend 4 Network meetings together over the 2 years. In addition, 
the program may offer additional professional development offerings based on participant request and through surveys 
that includ
e the following: Classroom Management, Conducting Parent Teacher Conferences/Parent communication, 
Meeting the needs of special needs students, Technology, Writing, etc. Sanger Unified's BTSA Induction Program provides 
support and assessment opportunities 
for all first and second year Participating Teachers to increase understanding of 
their own professional development, which will enable them to more effectively meet the diverse learning needs of their 
students. The mentors, called support providers, are t
rained in cognitive coaching, working with adult learners, and FACT. 
Support Providers attend a two
-
day training their first year and a one day Refresher every year after. In addition SPs are 
required to attend an orientation, and 2 after school trainings 
each year to work on their mentoring skills.
 
 
How are teachers supported during implementation (e.g., through in
-
class coaching, teacher
-
principal meetings, student 
performance data reporting, etc.)? With so many district initiatives, it is essential to ha
ve support for all teachers and 
administrators during implementation. Through many of our contracted trainings (Balanced Literacy, NGSS, UDL), our 
expert trainers provide on
-
site support and follow up personalized coaching. There are varied levels of suppo
rt, both at 
the site and district level. At school sites, teachers are supported during implementation by their grade
-
level or content 
colleagues through Professional Learning Communities. In addition, Curriculum Support Providers, Literacy Specialist 
Teac
hers, (Teachers on Special Assignment) and administrators provide on site support. District support is provided at the 
PLC level through collaborative unit/lesson planning and facilitated curriculum curating experiences.
 
 
All of our professional developmen
t is based on our students and teachers needs. Teachers in Sanger Unified have 
completed professional training courses designed to support educational priorities and objectives. Staff Development 
Days are designed to provide continuous learning opportuniti
es for administrators, teachers and classified personnel.
 
 
Sanger Unified uses Staff Development Days and support from site level Curriculum Support Providers and district level 
District Instructional Specialists to
 
assist teachers in classroom instructional strategies. The district provided a strong base 
for Common Core English Language Arts Implementation over the last few years through professional development 
focused on academic vocabulary, content reading and wr
iting, and unpacking standards. This year the district will provide 
an extensive Math training on the mathematical practices, math tasks, and academic discourse. Further English Language 
Arts professional development will focus on writing mini lessons and 
units.
 
 
New to the profession Teachers are also supported through the Sanger Unified School District Beginning Teacher Support 
and Assessment Induction Program (BTSA). Teachers participating in BTSA receive support from a trained support provider 
for two y
ears. The Sanger BTSA program uses the Formative Assessment for California Teachers (FACT) formative 
assessment to guide "new" teachers in their professional growth. The Sanger BTSA program also provides a menu of 
professional development opportunities for
 
BTSA Participating Teachers, Support Providers, and invites all teachers in the 
district to participate, if the topic meets their need. The menu of professional development offerings include the following:
 
Classroom Management, Conducting Parent Teacher C
onferences/Parent communication, Meeting the needs of special 
needs students, Technology, UDL, Writing, etc. Sanger Unified's BTSA Induction Program provides support and assessment 
opportunities for all first and second year Participating Teachers to incre
ase understanding of their own professional 
development, which will enable them to more effectively meet the diverse learning needs of their students.
 
 
In addition to staff development days, teachers participate in workshops and conferences on the followin
g: Literacy 
Strategies, Writing, Reading and Literacy Training, and ongoing SBE textbook adoption in
-
services are provided throughout 
the first 2
-
years of a curriculum, text implementation period. In
