By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

elementary school in the award winning Poway Unified School District we are proud to be an integral part of the growin
g 
community of 4S Ranch, San Diego. As a part of this master planned community, Monterey Ridge has been built to serve 
the students, family and community of 4S Ranch.
 
 
MRES has grown each year due to the expansion of houses around our 
community.
 
 
MRES curr
ently has a student population of 1,000 students.
 
 
Students have joined us from throughout San 
Diego County and farther as they take up residence in this quickly growing community. 
 
 
 
Our school is designed so that our students work
 
in six small learning c

houses six to seven classrooms which center around a family room. 
 
 
In addition to classrooms, each village contains 

 
where students are able to 
work on laptop computers, receive small group instruction, or work with volunteers from throughout the community. An 
outdoor patio provides additional work space for students and staff.
 
Several of our Kindergarten classrooms are
 
specially 
designed with internal bathrooms as well as a separate play area. Our school also offers a full time preschool class. This 
room has been specially built for preschool with a separate play area as well as facilities for our before and after schoo
l 
care program.
  
 
 
 
The main building houses the administrative offices, as well as a
 
 
multi
-
purpose room/theater, student library and 
a
 
computer lab.
 
In addition, we have a second lab located on campus in the D village. Our school also has 20,000 
square 
feet of solar panels which produce as much as 60% of the energy we consume each day. We are now in our eighth year of 
operation and many traditions are still taking shape.
 
 
We offer a web
-
based intervention and enrichment program that 
utilizes our C
ompass Learning program, which provides every student with their own individualized learning program. 
Staff for the new school were selected from sites throughout the Poway Unified School District and we continue to be 
highly sought after by both staff and
 
students. The excitement to create a new school and the opportunities to shape the 
culture and climate of a new school area continue to remain a big draw for teachers and staff. Through a competitive 
interview process staff came together in the Spring of 
2006 to build a vision and commitment for learning at Monterey 
Ridge. 
 
 
 
Our student population reflects the diversity of the community surrounding our school. Currently, 40% of our students 
are Asian, 11% Filipino, 6% Hispanic, 2% African American, and 37
% Caucasian. 10% of our students are listed as other, 
often a reflection of a mixture of ethnic groups. At this time, 25% of our students are classified as English Language 
Learners and 6% of our students receive free or reduced price lunch. We are thrille
d to be a part of this wonderful 
community and continue to build and foster strong partnerships with our families, businesses and others throughout 4S 
Ranch.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Poway Unified School District ensures that students 
attend clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each of its schools is maintained in good repair.  A work 
order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and well m
aintained.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A night custodial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms and offices daily.  
The district has adopted cleaning standards for all schools.  A summary of these standards is availab
le at the district offices.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessm
ents for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in t
he administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have
 
successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Research supports the positive effects professional development has on increasing student learning. All teaching staff is 
afforded the opportunity to participate in district and site sponsored professional development.  These workshops are 
presented in a s
emester or year
-
long series and support a wide variety of professional development. These include the 
use of effective instructional strategies, implementing the use of computer technology in teaching and learning, critical 
reading, writing and mathematics
 
strategies, effective use of assessments, positive discipline in
-
services, and multicultural 
training. Teachers and administrators are actively involved in professional development activities at the school, district, 
state, and national level.  The Poway 
Professional Assistance Program (PPAP) provides support for new teachers. Teachers 
are encouraged to participate in the National Board Certification process and recognized by the Poway Unified School 
District when they earn NBCT status.
