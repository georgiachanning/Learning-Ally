Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school us
es 
the Facility Inspection Tool (F
IT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emer
gency repairs are given the highest priority. The school personnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of the School 
Site Safety Plan is to provide a unified template for school sites to respond and recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the disruption of normal school operations.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan guides a coordinated school staff response
 
to an emergency, disaster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over time and those that may occur 
without warning.
 
 
The objectives of the School Site Safety Plan are as follows:
 
1.
 
Protect the safety and welfare of students, school staff, and visitors.
 
2.
 
Provide for a safe and coordinated response to emergencies.
 
3.
 

properties.
 
4.
 
Enable the District to restore normal conditions with minimal confusion in the shortest time possible.
 
5.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between sites and the District Emergency Operations Center (DEOC).
 
6.
 
Provide for the interface and c
oordination between the District EOC and the Cities of Richmond, El Cerrito, San 
Pablo, Pinole, Hercules, and Contra Costa County Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
 
7.
 
Provide for the orderly conversion of pre
-
designated District sites to mass care sites, whe
n necessary.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is updated annually.  Our school safety plan was last annually reviewed, updated, 
and discussed with school faculty and a student representative in January 2020.  A copy of the Comprehensive School

At Riverside Elementary, the Instructional Leadership Team (ILT) will facilitate professional development to build capacity 
for all teachers for effective implementation of the Common 
Core standards in English Language Arts, English Language 
Development, Mathematics, and Writing. Evidence of effective implementation is in student assessment data, including 
the Smarter Balanced Assessment System developed by the Smarter Balanced Assessme
nt Consortium (SBAC), CELDT, and 
CST. In addition, we focus on whole child development which includes socio
-
emotional development and growth towards 
the goal of character building. The teachers at Riverside meet three times a month in their grade level and
 
cross grade
-
level teams, building professional learning communities to identify a problem of practice, review/dis
-
aggregate student 
data, modify/differentiated instruction as part of meeting student needs. We actively participate in professional 
developme
nt opportunities. In the 2019 
-
 
2020 school year, Riverside continues to be a Teachers College Reading and 
Writing lab site school, which provides a forum for our teachers to not only further knowledge but move forward towards 
our goal to provide an exempl
ary education for our students. Quality instruction and instructional leadership are at the 
heart of the district's achievement efforts. To ensure this, the division of Teaching, Leading, and Learning engages 
teachers, administrators, and other personnel i
n ongoing professional development focused on improving teaching and 
learning. Training is provided to principals and other administrators to improve their ability to provide strong instructiona
l 
leadership and guide teaching and learning at school sites. 
The principals, in turn, provide support to teachers through 
staff conferences, opportunities for collaborative study and planning, and individual coaching based on ongoing classroom 
observations. Teachers and other staff are provided with both on and off
-
site professional development in all standards
-
based curriculum content areas. Beyond the content areas, professional development is provided in English Language 
Development, Gifted and Talented Education (GATE), differentiated instruction and educational 
technology. Training is 
made available in classroom management and the effective use of assessment data and teacher data teams in meeting 
the needs of all students. The primary goal of the professional development program is ensuring that all students are 
served by skilled, highly qualified teachers and that teachers are supported by strong, knowledgeable instructional leaders.
