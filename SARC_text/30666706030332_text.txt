School Description
 
Glen L. Martin Elementary School (Martin Elementary) is located on the corner of West Wilshire 
Avenue and South Olive Street in central Santa Ana.
 
 
In the 
2017
-
18 school year, Martin Elementary's focus is two
-
fold:  1) to use instructional 
techniques and learning activities that will help students meet the Common Core State Standards 
and prepare them for college and career, and 2) to create a positive, nurtu
ring school climate 
through positive behavior interventions and supports. This continues a long tradition at Martin 
Elementary of high academic expectations and a healthy, safe school environment for our students 
and staff. From analysis of student assessm
ent data we know that we need to push students to 
read for comprehension and to use academic language in writing and speaking in order to help 
them be successful in school, and eventually, in college and career.  Students' parents are a vital 
element in th
e education of Martin Elementary students and are welcome on campus as volunteers 
and life
-
long learners. Parenting classes are offered, with both day and evening schedules available. 
We host various classes and workshops on campus, including "Raising High
ly Capable Children," 
"Padres Promotores," and SAC parent leadership classes, as well as "Mommy and Me" programs 
that invite parents to bring their preschool
-
aged children on campus to learn kinder
-
readiness skills 
that can be reinforced by parents at home
. Parents are always welcome at Martin Elementary as 
partners in the education of the children in our community.
 
 
School Vision:
 
Our vision is to prepare students for academic success and to become life long learners by guiding 
them in their construction o
f knowledge and development of problem solving skills.
 
 
School Mission:
 
Martin Elementary is dedicated to creating a safe environment and a sense of community that 
inspires academic achievement, social
-
emotional health and a love of learning,  in order to 
support 
the development of the whole child.
 
 
Statement of Behavioral Purpose:
 
Martin Elementary School is a community of scholars. We are at school to learn, grow and become 
good citizens.
 
 
School Motto:
 
"Go Forth and Achieve"

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abo
ut the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal
 
or the

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Prior

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents are encouraged to be involved in Martin 
Elementary School's learning community by volunteering their time, attending school events, and 
sharing in the decision
-
making process. The LCAP process has inspired all in our community to offer suggestions and support to our school, as we work
 
as a team 
for the benefit of our students. The teachers welcome assistance in the classroom, and on other parts of the campus.  Parents
 
are always 
invited to help chaperone field trips.  Martin Elementary School provides a wide range of opportunities for parents to 
interact with school staff while 
supporting their child's academic efforts, including: monthly parent meetings, Back to School Night, Open House, student perf
ormances, fundraisers 
such as the Jog

home communication is provided in both English and Spanish via phone and text messages, the school web site, the Martin Eleme
ntary 
Facebook page, newsletters, flyers, the school m
arquee and general parent meetings. Through routine correspondence and special announcements, 
parents are kept informed on school news, student activities, schedules, policy changes, and curriculum updates.
 
 
Parents are integral members of campus organizat
ions that provide input on curricular programs, activities, and the design of the School's Plan, 
including School Site Council, English Language Advisory Council, and the Safety Committee. Parents have the opportunity to c
ontinue their own 
education and pr
eparation as parents through parenting classes, English language instruction for adults, and exercise and nutrition classes. 
We hold 
"Mommy and Me" classes for parents and their pre
-
school
-
aged children through the Learning Link, and other classes that pro
mote the building of the 
"40 Developmental Assets" in our students. "Padres Promotores" is a series of parent classes about how to prepare children so
 
that they are qualified 
to enter university. Parents in need of support and resources for their families 
are invited to inquire at Martin Elementary, and our administration and 
office staff works to link families to needed services. Our "Wellness Center" in room 15 is a place where parents can meet to
gether, and also receive 
support from our FACE community li
aison, who is on campus to support parents and family 2.5 days per week. Parents seeking more information about 
participating actively in the school community may contact the principal, TOSA or FACE community liaison at (714) 480

discuss egress/ingress, crime data and other factors 
related to Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED).

All curriculum and instructional improvement activities at Santa Ana Unified School District are aligned to the Common Core S
tate Standards. Staff 
development concentrations are selected and identified based upon 
student assessment results, the instructional strategies required in order to help 
students reach the Common Core State Standards, teacher input, and professional development surveys.
 
 
All staff development activities at Santa Ana Unified School District a
re focused on increasing student learning, proficiency, and well
-
being. The school 
and district continues its focus on the development of our students' Academic Language, while reinforcing students' skills wi
th Collaborative 
Conversations and using reading
 
skills foster by Close Reading of Complex Texts. During the 2018
-
19 school year, the district implementied the Benchmark 
Advance program, which is standards aligned and rigorous, and includes designated ELD instruction. Our focus is on using Benc
hmark Adv
ance to 
accelerate the learning of our students in English Language Arts. Every teacher is participated in 5 full days of training, o
ver the course of the year, in the 
use of Benchmark Advance.
 
 
Santa Ana Unified School District offers supplemental trainin
g and support for new and ongoing program implementation such as the Reading Academy 
and Irvine Math Project to help us build capacity in using our math adoption of Math Expressions program. Training activities
 
take place throughout the 
school year, after 
school, and during the summer and generally focus on curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.
 
 
We do not have any teachers who lack a full teaching credential during the 2019
-
20 school year. However, there are school and district supports availa
ble 
to support newly credentialed teachers that we have at Martin Elementary. New teachers and teachers not yet fully credentiale
d are supported by peer 
coaching and extensive staff development. The TIPS Induction Program (Teacher Induction and Professiona
l Support) is a state
-
approved program that 
offers additional support and assistance to newly credentialed teachers. All new teachers are assigned to a Support Provider 
(mentor teacher) and 
provided individualized support over a two
-
year period.
