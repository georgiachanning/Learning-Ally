By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our Mission Is Learning:
 
Next generation learners prepared w
ith 21st century skills.
 
 
 
Del Obispo Elementary School is a neighborhood school located in the city of San Juan Capistrano. Serving the communities 
of San Juan Capistrano and Dana Point, our school is located adjacent to Marco Forster Middle School and th
e San Juan 
Community Center. Built in 1974, Del Obispo has earned a reputation for providing students with a solid educational 
foundation in a supportive environment for almost 40 years.
 
 
Our school community is a diverse representation of lower, middle an
d upper socioeconomic levels, residing in single
-
family dwellings, condominiums, apartments and mobile home parks. The majority of parents work in professional and 
semi
-
professional occupations.
 
 
Unique enrichment opportunities are available to the student
s of Del Obispo due to its location. In the midst of historic 
San Juan Capistrano, the early Californian and Mexican heritages are well preserved at Mission San Juan Capistrano and 
other historical landmarks in the community. Just a few miles away is the D
ana Point Harbor, offering historical and 
oceanographic opportunities.
 
 
The school features five labs featuring career pathways, 1:1 chrome books in grades 1
-
5, designated iPads for 
kindergarten. One of our pathway labs is a working school garden which our
 
PTA has donated and students get hands
-
on 
experience in natural science.  Our students benefit from our Discovery Science Program which allows them hands on 
lessons to help solidify their learning. Grades 1
-
5 also participate in the Meet the Masters art p
rogram, paid for by our 
generous PTA. Students also participate in Coding lessons every week with an onsite coding teacher.
 
 
Del Obispo provides a solid educational foundation based on the Common Core State Standards for approximately 380 
kindergarten thro
ugh fifth grade students. In every classroom, we have four specific school goals: a focus on objectives, 
checking for understanding, rigorous instruction, and student engagement.  All students are provided with consistent 
"Best First Instructional Practice
s," along with interventions for students needing additional support.  In addition to the 
regular education program, 3 Special Day Classes serve students with special needs and targets learning disabilities, 
particularly in the area of language. All of our
 
teachers have been trained to use SIOP strategies to support all learners, 
including English Language Learners. English Language Learners receive 20 
-
 
30 minutes of designated ELD daily. Struggling 
students receive RTI support with the Voyages Passport pr
ogram and iReady.

Parent Involvement Policy
 
 
At Del Obispo Elementary School, we recognize that parental involvement is a critical dimension of effective schooling. 
We believe the school and the home cannot be looked at in isolation from one 
another; families and schools need to 
collaborate to help children adjust to the responsibilities of being successful students. Research has shown that parental

responsibility shared with parents. Parents are also invited to actively participate in school decision making and to develop
 
their leadership skills in governance and advocacy. By joining the PT
A, School Site Council, English Language Advisory 
Committee the parents are able to be involved in the planning, review, and improvement of various programs including 
Title I.
 
 
Through conferences, letters, school messenger emails and phone calls, and pare
nt meetings (i.e. Back to School, Open 
House) parents are provided with timely information about curriculum, assessments, and expected proficiency levels for 
student achievement. Parents are invited to attend appropriate meetings to help the school and the
 
students reach stated 
goals, objectives and standards. This will ensure that the school remains focused on our primary responsibility to provide 
a high
-
quality curriculum and instructional program in a supportive and effective learning environment that en
ables all 
students to meet academic expectations set forth in the Common Core State Standards.
 
 
At Del Obispo Elementary School, we believe that the parents have the responsibility and opportunity to work with the 
school in a mutually supportive and respec
tful partnership with the goal of helping their children succeed in school. We 
are committed to increasing parental involvement and building capacity for parent support, which will ultimately improve 
student achievement. At Del Obispo Elementary School, we
 
have a parent school compact that details parent, school, and 
student responsibilities. We also will provide all important documents translated in Spanish.
 
 
At Del Obispo Elementary School, some of the activities and events that encourage involvement of a
ll parents, include:
 

 
PTA Membership/meetings
 

 
School Site Council meetings

Capistrano Unified School District places great value on 
the role of professional learning, and utilizes systems
-
wide 
structures and strategies to promote continuous learning of adults that result in increased learning for students.  The 
ongoing focus for professional learning is to support the district's Wildly
 
Important Goal for Teaching and Learning.  It is 
the district goal to engage students in meaningful, challenging, and innovative educational experiences to increase post
-
secondary options for all students.
 
 
It is the goal of  Capistrano Unified School Dis
trict to ensure all students receive Great First Instruction (GFI).  The vision 
for GFI is that all learning environments include Lesson Preparation, Interaction, Strategies, and Review and Assessment 
as defined by the Sheltered Instruction Observation Pro
tocol (SIOP).  By design, the model for providing professional 
learning is multi
-
tiered, and ranges from large
-
scale, district
-
wide learning opportunities focused on priority areas to site
-
specific, embedded professional learning (including coaching) that 
supports teachers in the transfer of that learning to the 

school hours to further support district initiatives and teacher needs for ongoing
 
professional learning. The outcome of all 
CUSD professional learning is to improve educator effectiveness in order to increase student learning. In support of this 
outcome, administrators participate in professional learning to increase their knowledge of
 
quality practices, California 
Content Standards, and strategies for instructional leadership.
 
 
Since 2004, all schools provide specific release time for embedded professional learning using late start or early release 
days.  In grades K
-
8, this time is kn
own as ACE time (Articulation and Collaboration for Excellence).  The purpose of this 
time is for educators to examine the impact of their practice on student learning, with a focus on continuous improvement.  
Schools work to identify key areas of learning
 
based on an analysis of student data, upon which they place their focus for 
professional learning and set annual measurable goals based upon those identified areas of need. These areas are 
determined through the analysis of student learning data from mult
iple sources, including, but not limited to high stakes 
testing. The action plan developed to accomplish these goals outlines priorities for teacher training and implementation.

Throughout the year, the structure of collaboration typically involves teache
r teams engaging in ongoing examination of 
standards
-
based curriculum, the examination of meaningful formative and summative assessment data, and powerful 
teaching strategies that get results in student learning. In 2017 the District developed the CUSD Pro
fessional Learning 

Goals, Relational Trust, Focus on Learning, Shared Responsibility, Action
-
Oriented, Data Driven, and Systems and 
Struc
tures for Support  to ensure all students are learning at high levels.  These embedded professional learning activities 
help prepare teams to provide a differentiated instructional program that meets the needs of all students.
 
 
Beginning teachers receive s
ystematic training and support during their first two years of teaching within the CUSD 
Induction Program. This program assists new teachers as they build upon the skills they already possess upon entering the 
field of teaching, and provides them with supp
ort from a veteran teacher. The program is approved by the California State 

to those activities previously described, all teachers may rec
eive support, assistance, and opportunities to grow 
professionally through their participation in school site learning teams, student study teams, from district resource 
teachers, and the Peer Assistance and Review Program.
