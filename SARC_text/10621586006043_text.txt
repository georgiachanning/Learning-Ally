By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 

 
Malaga Elementary School continues the imp
ortant work of improving the academic achievement of our students. Our 
goal is to ensure a safe, secure environment that offers a wide variety of activities designed to encourage students' good 
character, academic achievement, and physical fitness. 
 
 
Malag
a continues to implement best instructional practices, while incorporating even greater focus and accountability on 
our classroom instruction through Professional Learning Communities, direct, active instruction, and common core 
opportunities that reflect 
21st century learning. Our site administration works with our teachers and paraprofessionals to 
provide high quality, well structured, and consistent reading and math programs. Additionally, all children receive small 
group focused instruction at their ins
tructional and challenge level and English Language Learners receive 30 minutes per 
day of instruction targeting the development of English skills.
 
 
We continue to work with families to increase the number of parents involved in the Parent Club, the Englis
h Language 
Advisory Committee (ELAC), and the School Site Council (SSC). Our ELAC and SSC advise on the use of our categorical funds 
and review our various school programs. We communicate with parents through our weekly newsletter, our telephone 
call syste
m, an electronic message board, and various forms of social media. All communication between school and home 
is in English and Spanish.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Site and district staff members ensure that the school is 
clean, safe, and functional. Every month we evaluate the 
cleanliness and condition of the facilities and grounds using a school inspection form. Our school has undergone numerous 
renovations to add new buildings and update older buildings with windows, car
peting, shelving, heating/air conditioning, 
roofing, bathroom updating, concrete replacement, etc. and so on. Our custodial and maintenance staff does an excellent 
job. Custodians check the rest rooms after each recess to make sure they are clean and well 
supplied.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by 
the Williams decision of 2004. As a result, our facilities are assessed on more than a dozen aspects:  their structural 
int
egrity, electrical systems, heating and ventilation systems, cleanliness, safety, and more. The important purpose of this 
assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good repair. If anything needs to be repaired, this 
assessment
 
identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for this assessment 
were written by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams decision.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We inspect our facilities every month to ensure the safety of equipment and buildings. A school safety plan, reviewed 
annually, is on file at the site and the district office. Teachers review the guidelines for play equipment and boundaries 
each year. Teac
hers, assistants, and administrators monitor students before school, at recess, at lunch, and after school. 
All classrooms have signs posted with charts and procedures to follow in the event of earthquakes, tornadoes, and lock
-
downs. Monthly fire drills an
d annual inspections by the fire marshal ensure fire safety compliance. Our handbook explains 
our emergency evacuation plan to the Malaga Community Center, which is a short walk from our campus. Parents are also 
regularly notified of any safety concerns th
rough the weekly newsletter. Additionally, the automated phone system allows 
us to contact all parents in a matter of minutes in the event of an emergency.  The safety plan was last updated and 
discussed with school stakeholders on October 8, 2019.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
Malaga Elementary provides the services of a part
-
time health aide, nursing services, and a library technician. The resource 
specialist is available for a full day each day and the district psychologist is on site weekly. A certified speech and langu
age 
pa
thologist and speech technicians provide speech therapy. Fourth and fifth graders also take instrumental music 
instruction or choral music. The site also employees several instructional aides who work closely with students.
 
 
Gifted and Talented Education (
GATE): We identify second through fifth grade students for our GATE/ enrichment program 
using the district criteria, which incorporates both formal and informal assessments. Students may qualify for GATE or for 
enrichment based on their overall performance
. Identified students are able to work with the learning specialist or the 
enrichment teacher each week to enhance their knowledge and experience in science, writing, literacy, the arts, and 
technology.
 
 
Special Education Program: Our students benefit from
 
the services of a full time resource specialist, a part
-
time speech 
pathologist, and a part
-
time district psychologist. Our resource assistant and speech technician work with students daily. 
The Student Study Team makes recommendations for extra help and 
assessment. The principal, psychologist, resource 
teacher, nurse, and speech pathologist meet monthly to ensure that we address all student needs in a coordinated fashion.
 
 
English Learner Program:  All teachers at Malaga are certified in Cross
-
cultural La
nguage and Academic Development 
(CLAD) and provide 30 minutes daily of English Language Development to groups composed exclusively of English learners 
and additional sheltered instruction in English throughout the day.  These groups are organized by studen
t need and skill 
development.  Students are assessed with the California English Language Development Test (CELDT) annually and 
regularly on an informal basis.
 
 
Response to Intervention:  Malaga uses a 3
-
tiered system to provide appropriate services and in
struction to every student 
in order to assure that prior to being referred to special education, all other options and services have been considered.  
Every student in school receives 60 minutes per day of English Language Arts instruction at their level o
f need.  Some 
students may participate in challenge activities, some in core curricular support, and some in remediation.  We believe 
that this attention to all students' needs has been central to the academic growth that is apparent in our CST and API 
sco
res.  Additionally, teacher teams collaborate with a certificated tutor across all curriculum areas to provide immediate 
and specific support to students based on performance on common assessments at that grade level.
