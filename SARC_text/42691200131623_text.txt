Welcome to our "Jiménez Family!" Our school is named after the late Santa Maria-Bonita
School District employee, Roberto Jiménez, an outstanding community member, and his
brother, Dr. Francisco Jiménez, a remarkable professor and author. 
I invite you to explore Jiménez Elementary School's annual School Accountability Report Card,
which provides valuable information about our school's instructional programs, academic
achievement, classroom materials, school safety, facilities, and staff. Our school is staffed with
highly qualified teachers who are extremely dedicated to helping all children succeed. We take it
upon ourselves to be constant learners. Students receive a California standards-based
curriculum, presented by dedicated professionals based on the individual needs of the students.
We are considerate of students' cultural backgrounds, and build students' learning based on
prior knowledge. Ongoing evaluation of student progress and achievement helps us refine the
instructional program so all students can achieve academic proficiency.
We have made a commitment to provide the best educational program possible for Jiménez
students. We welcome any suggestions or questions you may have about the information
contained in this report or about any aspect of our school.

 Physical Fitness
In the spring of each year, Jim
nez Elementary School is
required by the state to administer a physical fitness test to all
students in grade five. The physical fitness test measures each

student's ability to complete fitness tasks in six major areas.
Students who either meet or exceed the standards in all six

fitness areas are considered to be in the "healthy fitness zone."
The chart reported in this document reports only the percentage
in each category, not a cumulative total of the results for
categories 4 of 6 and 5 of 6. Comparative district and state
results can be found at the CDE's website.

students in this category is too small for statistical accuracy or to protect student
privacy. California Assessment of Student Performance andProgressThe California Assessment of Student Performance andProgress (CAASPP) System includes the Smarter Balanced
Summative Assessments (SBAC) for students in the general
education population, and the California Alternate Assessments
(CAAs) for students with the most significant cognitive
disabilities.  Only eligible students may participate in the
administration of the CAAs.  CAAs items are aligned with
alternative achievement standards, which are linked with the
Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  CAASPP results are a
measure of how well students are mastering California's
standards in English language arts/literacy (ELA) and
mathematics, and are given to grades three through eight and
grade eleven. SBAC tests assess student performance in
ELA/Literacy and mathematics utilizing computer-adaptive tests
and performance tasks, and CAAs test items are aligned with
alternative achievement standards which are linked with the
Common Core State Standards (CCSS).The CAASPP results shown in this report include overall resultscomparing the school, district and state scores as well as the
school's overall score in each applicable subgroup. Results are
shown only for subgroups with ten students or more taking the
exam. For those categories that are blank in the tables, no
students met subgroup criteria. More information on CAASPP
can be found on the California Department of Education's
website www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/ca/. CAASPP Test Results in ELA and Mathematics - All StudentsPercent of Students Scoring at Proficient orAdvanced(meeting or exceeding the state standards)SchoolDistrictState17-1818-1917-1818-1917-1818-19English-Language Arts/Literacy(grades 3-8 and 11)38.038.0

facilities were built in 2014; ongoing maintenance and campus

improvements ensure facilities remain up to date and provide
adequate space for students and staff. District maintenance and

site custodial staff ensure that the repairs necessary to keep the
school in good condition are completed in a timely manner. A
work order process is used by school and district staff to
communicate non-routine maintenance requests.
Every morning before school begins, the custodian inspects
facilities for safety hazards or other conditions that need
attention prior to students and staff entering school grounds. One
day custodian and three evening custodians (two full-time and
one part-time) are assigned to Jim
nez Elementary School. The
day custodian is responsible for:

 Campus Supervision
School administration and staff place a high priority on providing
adequate adult supervision on campus before, during, and after
school. As students arrive on campus each morning,
administrators and staff are strategically assigned to designated
entrance areas and the playground. During recess, campus
supervisors monitor playground activity. Campus supervisors
monitor lunch time activity in the cafeteria and on the
playground. At the end of the day when students are dismissed,
administrators and staff monitor student behavior to ensure a

safe and orderly departure. 
Jimnez Elementary School is a closed campus. During school
hours, all visitors must sign in at the school's office and wear
identification badges while on school grounds.

and the district office to fulfill Senate Bill 187 requirements.
Components of this plan include child abuse reporting
procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures,
disaster response procedures, procedures for safe arrival and
departure from school, sexual harassment policy, and dress
code policy. The school's most recent school safety plan was
reviewed, updated, and discussed with school staff in August
2019.Classroom Environment Discipline & Climate for LearningJimenez Elementary School's discipline practices and behaviormanagement strategies comply with approved board policies and
are designed to create effective learning environments and
minimize classroom disruptions. Progressive discipline is
employed in the classroom for those students experiencing
difficulty following school rules, and proactive measures are
utilized for those demonstrating positive behavior. Disciplinary
intervention is managed by school administrators in a fair, firm,
and consistent manner based upon the nature of each situation.  
A cohort has been formed to implement a Multi-Tiered System of
Support (MTSS) along with a Positive Behavioral Intervention &
Supports (PBIS) system.  These systems will assist in
implementing evidence-based practices to support positive
relationships for students, families, and staff.Suspensions & Expulsions16-1717-1818-19School% Students Suspended1.40.90.3

Number of School Days Dedicated to Staff Development and ContinuousImprovement2017-182018-192019-20222 Instructional Materials
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Jim
nez Elementary
School are aligned to the California Content Standards and

Frameworks. Instructional materials are selected from the state's
most recent list of standards-based materials and adopted by the
State Board of Education. The district follows the State Board of
Education's six-year adoption cycle for core content materials
(English/language arts, math, science, and social science).
On Wednesday, September 11, 2019, the Santa Maria-Bonita
School District's Board of Education held a public hearing to
certify the extent to which textbooks and instructional materials
have been provided to students. The Board of Education
adopted Resolution 19-03 which certifies as required byEducation Code §60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional
materials were provided to all students, including English
learners, in the district to the extent that each pupil has a
textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to
take home, and (2) sufficient textbooks and instructional
materials were provided to each student, including English
learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and
consistent with the cycles and content of the curriculum
frameworks in math, science, history-social science, and
English/language arts.In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclosein their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materials used for
their visual/performing arts curricula. During the 2019-20 school
year, all visual/performing arts classes offered in the Santa
Maria-Bonita School District had sufficient textbooks and/or
materials for all students enrolled in those classes.TextbooksAdoption YearPublisher & Series

All curriculum and instruction are being aligned to the California
State Standards approved by the State Board of Education. The
instructional program is structured so that all students receive
instruction appropriate to their learning level. Teachers use a
variety of research-based instructional strategies and techniques
using state-approved instructional materials to ensure academic
success and best first teach (Tier 1) instruction.
Jiménez is proud to offer an English/Spanish Dual Language
Immersion (DLI) program to its students.  Our DLI program is a
parent option program which runs alongside our regular school
program.  Students from Jiménez's boundaries and students
living in the SMBSD boundaries may apply to participate in the
program.  Parents who choose to have their children partake in

the DLI program will give their child the opportunity to learn a

new language (English/Spanish) and culture while maintaining
the rigor and demands of the Common Core State Standards.
Jiménez currently offers a DLI in kinder through fourth grade that
will grow by one grade each year. This program is an additive
language program; students become proficient in their primary

language while learning a new language. These skills allow
students to catapult into our global society and economy with
competitive language skills and cultural awareness.
Students with special gifts and talents need more challenging
curriculum and instruction. The Gifted and Talented Education
(GATE) program is offered to students in grades 3 through 6 who
have been identified as academically gifted through
district-administered assessments. Students are clustered by

grade level to receive differentiated instruction. Instruction is

provided by teachers who are GATE trained.
For students whose primary language is not English and who
have limited English proficiency, Jim
nez Elementary School
offers programs to help them acquire English as quickly as
Jimnez Elementary School
72018-19 School Accountability Report Cardpossible and prepare them to meet the state's academic content
standards. English learners are clustered in the classroom by
language fluency level to receive differentiated instruction from
the classroom teacher. Instruction focuses on reinforcement of
class lessons, reading intervention, and targeted support in

areas of need. All students receive English Language
Development instruction as a supplement to their regular
language arts instruction. Jim
nez Elementary School's teachers
utilize Benchmark for grades K-5 and Study Sync for grade 6,
both state-approved textbook adoptions. English learners are

assessed annually using the ELPAC exam (English Language
Proficiency Assessment for California); results are used to
evaluate student progress, intervention programs, and teaching
strategies.Jimnez Elementary School's special education program is
staffed by a Resource Specialist Program Teacher and Speech
Pathologist. Instruction is provided in the least restrictive
environment and based on each student's Individual Education
Plan (IEP). Students have access to a comprehensive curriculum
and are mainstreamed into the general education class, with
small group and individualized instruction in the resource room.
The IEP team meets annually to establish goals and objectives,
define academic instruction, evaluate the effectiveness of the
student's plan, and make instructional adjustments as necessary.
Jimnez Elementary School takes advantage of the district's
participation in the Santa Barbara Special Education Local Plan
Area, which provides a pool of professional resources and

expertise in the field of special education.
Jimnez Elementary School provides a variety of intervention
and remediation programs to support students' efforts to achieve
academic success and reach grade level expectations. Using
multiple measures, district benchmark assessments, and
end-of-unit exams, teachers and administrators can identify
students who are struggling or performing below proficiency
grade level standards. For those students who need extra help in

any subject area, a Student Study Team pulls together school
and family resources to identify and develop strategies to help
students improve academic and/or behavioral performance.
Intervention strategies include:
ŁTeacher Tutors (Small Group Instruction)

ŁBilingual Instructors

ŁBilingual Instructional Assistants (kindergarten

  through third grade)
ŁAfter School Intervention Activities

ŁLeveled Group Instruction

ŁMigrant Extended Day Program

ŁASES (After School Education & Safety)
