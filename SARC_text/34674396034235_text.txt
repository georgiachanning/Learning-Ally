School Description:
 
 
Pony Express Elementary School is located in the south end of the district in a middle class family 
oriented neighborhood.  We educate 410 students from kindergarten through sixth grade. Students 
come from various ethnicities, backgrounds, home languages, 
and academic abilities. To answer 
the needs of all of our students, we offer the following  programs: Autistic Pre
-
School, Resource 
Specialist Program, full day self contained classes Gifted and Talented Education (GATE), English 
Language Development, Spec
ial Day Class (Developmentally), Clubs, tutoring, and after school care 

 
 
The home/school connection is strong. School advisory groups and Parent Teacher Association 
(PTA) actively participate at the school. We participate in activ
ities that increase our involvement 
with the community. We work with various community groups, such as Little League, Greenhaven 
Soccer Club, Sac Youth Band, and Parks and Recreation to make our school the center for 
community activities. Our 4th R before
-
 
and after
-
school program works closely with the school to 
reinforce schoolwork and participates in our fundraising efforts. In addition, our daily after
-
school 
only program, ASES, helps students finish their homework, improve literacy, and participate in 
enrichment activities.
 
 
Pony Express Elementary has received recognition as a S.C.U.S.D Exemplary School and a School On 
the Move. 52% of students are at grade level or above, and we have moved many students forward 
in their achievement. We also have the d
istinction of being a Title I Academic Achievement School 
and a Distinguished California Distinguished School. Out  of 5,741 public elementary schools in 
California, only 48 schools can proudly proclaim these double awards in one year.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

-
20)
 
The district instructional material evaluation committee, consisted of members representing teachers
, administrators, other staff, students, 
parents/guardians, and community, ensures that the selected textbooks, technology
-
based materials and other educational materials effectively support 
the district's adopted courses of study and meet current curricul
ar goals and California Content Standards. Teachers, students, parents/guardians and 
community members have the opportunity to review and provide input about the instructional materials being considered for ado
ption. 
Recommendations for the adoption and/or
 
withdrawal of instructional materials by the instructional material evaluation committee are presented to 
the Board by the Superintendent or designee and include documentation supporting the recommendation. In some instances, the c
onsidered textbooks 
and/
or instructional materials are piloted for a period of time before being recommended for adoption to the Board of Education.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators 
and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including ELA 
Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Ling
uistically Relevant Teaching and Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through this program deeply align with the needs of our ind
ividual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and co
nnect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson design.

Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outside of contracted hours. In additio
n to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunity for teachers to engage
 
in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening their c
ontent knowledge, strengthening their instructional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of responsibility.
