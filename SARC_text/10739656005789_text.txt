About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Central Unified Schools maintain current and standards
-
aligned instructional materials in good repai
r, for all students. Materials are locally adopted and 
reflect programs currently approved by the State Board of Education. All materials currently adopted reflect the most recent 
SBE adoptions and support 
the current California Frameworks.
 
 
Every student,
 
including English Learners, Special Education, and other special populations have their own textbook. In the case of class se
ts, those sets 
augment individual texts that have been issued to individual students. These class sets are made based on a commitm
ent of the district administration 
and the governing board and are not the product of any state requirement.
 
 
All instructional materials are subject to a school and district review process. Materials may be piloted and all materials t
hat are selected and 
recommended for local adoption are reviewed by teachers, administration, and any parents who wish to review the materials. Th
e Central Unified Board 
of Trustees review and adopt based on the recommendation of the district adoption committees and Educationa
l Services.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes th
e 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only el
igible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Pershing Elementary teaching and learning staff have 
established relationships with parents to provide a positive environment at home and positive 
school enrichment. Gathering data from the yearly Parent Survey helps us determine areas of need. We also gather information 
from parents at Parent 
Meetings and C
offee with the Principal to prioritize areas of focus at our site.
 
 
Parents receive updated information regarding school activities and future academic plans at our Parent Meetings and via our 
weekly school newsletter 
called, "The Paw Print."  Our weekly "
Principal Report" is communicated using Parent Square and sends information to homes in three languages. Parents 
help plan and volunteer at the annual Family Fun Night, Annual Fun Run, Parent/Child Toddler Story Hour and Social Play Group
 
reading program, 
and 
our Spring Open House program. The administration encourages on
-
going communication with parents. The parent/teacher conferences, Coffee With 
the Principal, Parent Meetings, Parent Square program, and bulletins sent home provide contact with parents. A
dditional committees or meetings that 
encourage parent participation and input for school improvement include:
