School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Tony Tobin Elementary currently serves approximately 940 students.  "Trailblazer Pride" is in abundance TTES and for very 
good reason! Our students are kind and compassionate, as well as hard
working.  Our teachers are exceptional and our 
parents are a valuable and involved part of our team. At Tony Tobin, we set high expectations for each student, offer 
superior instruction, motivate our students, and provide them with the very best environmen
t in which to learn.  Our 
motto is "Honoring the Past, Enriching the Present, Inspiring the Future." This is an exciting time for all of us!
 
 
At Tony Tobin we believe in teaching students behavioral expectations and supporting them in meeting these expecta
tions 
through the Positive Behavior Intervention model.  Students earn recognition and rewards for their excellent behavior.
 
 
Tony Tobin offers a variety of programs to support our students.  During the school day, teachers work through 
Professional Learni
ng Communities to ensure students are offered a guaranteed, viable (and engaging) curriculum.  We 
strive daily to challenge every student, while offering support when needed. We are fortunate to have a Literacy Specialist, 
a PBIS counselor, and various Spe
cial Education programs, to assist students depending upon their needs.
 
 
At Tony Tobin Elementary we have a very involved PTA that works to include all families and provide opportunities for all 
to be involved.  Our community comes together each Friday at 
our Friday Flag ceremony, where students are recognized 
for excellent behavior, hard work, and academic achievements.  Come on out to a Friday Flag; you will enjoy our awesome 
school spirit!

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvement
s (Most Recent Year)
 
 
TVUSD's Maintenance and Operations division works diligently to ensure our facilities are clean and safe for students, 
teachers and staff. The district follows a comprehensive preventive and deferred maintenance program to offset cos
tly 
repairs and minimize disruptions to the instructional program. Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices 
and bathrooms are clean and well maintained.  Our school has one full time lead custodian during school hours, and a 
night crew that
 
comes in and cleans the entire facility after school hours. In addition, between two and three times a year 
the carpets at each site are steam cleaned.Tony Tobin Elementary was built in 2005. The school offers 51 classrooms, all 
of which are permanent bui
ldings. The school also has a multipurpose room, a library and an administration building. The 
entire perimeter of the school is closed and secure at all times. Guests and visitors enter through the front office.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only e
ligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for

to provide support for students as well as the classroom teacher. A parent can also support the school by providing 
homework support fo
r students and by encouraging students to read daily. The Parent Teacher Association provides 
many parent opportunities to get involved at our school through family

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our School Site Safety Plan is a comprehensive plan that encompasses all disaster preparedness procedures and 
emergency plans. It also addresses everyday procedures and standards that ensure the safety of students on campus. All 
of 
these procedures are practiced as drills throughout the year. The administration gives feedback to the staff after each 
drill indicating what went well and what may need attention or need to be fixed the next time. A copy of each School Site 
Safety Plan is
 
also maintained by the Temecula Police Department. Officers can access every TVUSD School Site Safety 
Plan via laptop computers in their cars. The School Safety Plan can be reviewed by parents, and parent input is considered 
as we continually work to ensu
re all students are safe at school. The staff is working to consistently update and maintain 
our site safety plan.

The Temecula Valley Unified School District is committed to ensuring that each and every child in its care receives a 
rigorous, multifaceted educational experience preparing them for the demands of college and career.
 
 
TVUSD teachers engage in active staff
 
development throughout the year by attending:
 
 

 
In
-
District training sessions provided by staff and consultants.
 

 
Site
-
based training sessions presented during staff meetings and committee/grade level meetings.
 

 
One on one training provided during 
formal observations and post observation conferences.
 
 
Teachers work together through Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) based on content area and grade level. All 
instructional staff participate weekly during professional growth time, meeting in the
ir PLC groups to align curriculum, 
refine teaching strategies, create assessments, analyze student achievement data to drive instruction and to ensure we 
are meeting the needs of all learners, teachers with specialized training are given opportunities to t
rain their peers, and 
provide instructional support as teacher leaders.
 
 
Staff development focuses on implementing the California Common Core State Standards and state frameworks in English
-
Language Arts, Science, Social Science, and Math, K
-
12. Routine di
strict sessions bring teacher leaders and principals 
together to devise and refine the curriculum and assessments. Tony Tobin is focusing on embedding opportunities for 
critical thinking throughout our lessons in all subject areas, with an emphasis on the 
mathematical practices. We believe 
our students will need to be proficient in the "4 C's" 
-
 
Communication, Collaboration, Critical Thinking, and Creativity 
-
 
in 
order to be successful in today's world. It is our commitment to help our students gain these c
apabilities that will support 
them in their future endeavors.
