About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each 
year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local prior
ities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/g
uardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Professional growth activities are planned annually based on current needs and input received from staff and assessment data.
  
Teachers implement the 
California State Standards in all academic subject areas through lessons that target instruction for stude
nt learning.  Students also participate in rigorous 
learning activities that support the standards and provide a rich academic environment.  Weekly and monthly collaborative ins
tructional planning through 
Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) is provide
d for teachers to develop lessons and activities, review assessment data and research instructional 
practices and resources.
 

  
Our 
current focus is to 
increase the rigor in mathematics, strengthen our Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS), implement Next Genera
tion Science Standards 
(NGSS), improve our arts integration with other content areas and broaden our use of tec
hnology in the classroom.
