School Description
 
Midland Elementary School, built in 1962, currently serves a population of approximately 650 
students in grades K
-
5. We are very proud of our ability to provide our multi
-
ethnic population with 
a quality education for all students who attend our school. Ou
r teachers use their experience to 
provide a variety of instructional strategies.
 
 
Enrichment programs and special services enhance the staff's ability to meet individualized needs 
through computer assisted instruction, Title I programs, Resource Specialis
t program, Speech, and 
Adapted Physical Education services. We also offer Compass Learning, a digital intervention 
program for kindergarten through fifth grade students.. Furthermore, we offer Project Moving 
Forward, Language Power, FEV on
-
line tutoring at
 
student homes and after school tutoring on 
campus. The Imagine Learning Program is also offered for EL students at Midland. We also have 
UCR tutors that provide intervention support for Midland students during the school year. In 
addition, The City of Mor
eno Valley runs the after
-
school Think Together enrichment program on 
our site.
 
 
 
Midland Elementary School's school program coordination is a cooperative process involving 
administration, parents, teachers, support staff, staff leaders, parent representat
ives, School Site 
Council (SSC), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), African American Parent Advisory 
Council (AAPAC) and our Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) working together to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the school program.
 
 
After completion 
of a well
-
rounded education, our fifth grade students feed into Palm Middle 
School and Vista Heights Middle School. Education is a cooperative process shared by the 
community, school, children, and parents. The goal of Midland Elementary School is to provi
de an 
effective educational program, which addresses the academic, personal, and social growth of its 
students.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

State Priority: Pupil A
chievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

statistical accuracy or to protect student 
privacy.
 
 
Note: ELA and mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative 

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summ
ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number 
of students who participated in both assessments.

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
-
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
-
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is 
not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated
 
using only students who received scores.
