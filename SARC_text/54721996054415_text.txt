Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Terra Bella Elementary strives to maintain a safe, healthy, nurturing, and orderly school campus that encourages positive 
attitudes in students and staff. A joint effort between students and 
staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-
free. The 
custodial/grounds staff of 5 maintains clean and safe facilities. District administration and the Terra Bella Board of Truste
es 
have placed a great emphasis on campus safety and security. Teachers and 
classified staff supervise students on campus 
before and after school and during recess. At noon, duty supervisors monitor students during lunchtime. All visitors must 
sign in at the principal's office and receive proper authorization to be at the school. 
Visitors are asked by the school site 
staff to display their pass at all times. The chart displays the results of the most recent school facilities inspection, pro
vided 
by the district during the last inspection, in August 27, 2019. The facilities were fou
nd in good condition with an overall 
rating of 100.00%.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

graduation, etc. We also have School Site Council and ELAC/DELAC meetings that meet once in the months of September,

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Terra Bella Elementary Safety Plan is revised annually by the Site Safety Committee, which is comprised of the all 
administrators, principal, lead custodian, cafeteria manager and staff. Key elements of the 
plan focus on student and staff 
safety and emergency preparedness. Emergency and earthquake drills are held on a regular basis; fire drills are held once 
a month and secure campus drills are held various times a year. The last School Safety Plan was review
ed, updated, and 
discussed on January 21, 2019. The current facilities were built in the 1930's. Teachers and classified staff supervise 
students on campus before and after school and during recess, and noon duty supervisors monitor students during 
lunchti
me.
 
 
Discipline and Climate for Learning
 
At Terra Bella Elementary, we believe that meaningful learning must occur in a safe disciplined, and positive environment. 
Students are guided by specific rules and classroom expectations that promote respect, coope
ration, courtesy, and 
acceptance to others. The goal of Terra Bella Elementary discipline program is to provide students with opportunities to 
learn self
-
discipline through a system of consistent rewards and consequences for their behavior. Parents and stu
dents

Professional development is viewed as a key component in providing an excellent 
education to the students at Terra Bella 
Elementary. Areas of focus are determined through a collaborative process with input from the teaching staff, School Site 
Council, ELAC/DELAC Committee, Terra Bella School Board and the administration. Decisions as 
to the areas of need are 
data driven with a focus on alignment to the standards. Staff development is provided both on and off site. Staff is 
encouraged to pursue in
-
service that is aligned with the California State Common Core Standards and Frameworks.
 
 
T
o facilitate implementation of the curriculum, by new and non
-
tenured teachers, the district established a Coaching 
Program that actively supports the new teachers. Each teacher is assigned a grade level instructional leader, the 
instructional leader acts 
as a resource person or their mentor for the school year. Release time, counseling, materials 
development or overviews on budget expenditures are a few of their responsibilities. Grade level meetings are held twice 
a month on pertinent topics to allow a ve
nue for discussion and support of the new staff. Monthly staff meetings are held 
with the teachers and the instructional aides to facilitate communication and improve the quality of instruction in the 
classroom. Instructional aides are encouraged to partic
ipate in the district in
-
service opportunities.
