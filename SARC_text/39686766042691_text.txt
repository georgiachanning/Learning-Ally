About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is 
required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (
LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported i
n an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa
/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members shoul
d contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have
 
books in core classes for all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far mor
e meaningful when along with 
the more detailed description of textbooks conta

in our core classes and their dates of publication.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
McKinley School was built in 1951 and it expanded though the years with the addition o
f portable classrooms.
 
 
Each school site has classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library and an administration building. The number of classrooms at e
ach school site varies, 
depending on enrollment and available space. Several sites have portable class room
s to accommodate increased enrollment.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that em
ergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that all classrooms, restrooms, and facilities are 
well
-
maintained and in good 
repair. McKinley School currently has three full time 
custodians. The Assistant Principal works with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to 

ices, library, and hallways. 
Ou
r school grounds are kept up to federal and state safety regulations.
 
 
During the month of September of 2017, the carpets of six classrooms was replaced in order to provide a clean and healthy cla
ssrooms for our students.
 
 
Stockton Unified takes great effo
rts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, we utilize the facility survey inst
rument 
developed by the State of California OPSC. The full report is available upon request.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Bal
anced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible studen
ts 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The perce
ntage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

s calculated
 
by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students w
ho met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of stude
nts who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achieve
ment level percentages are calculated using only students who received scores.

School Safety Plan
 
Safety, Organization, Accountability, and Respect (SOAR) is the basis of our positive behavior system at McKinley Elementary.
 
It is our goal to provide 
quality instruction in a 
safe, positive environment for all students.  McKinley School implements a comprehensive school safety plan assuring all staf
f 
members at McKinley are aware of safety expectations and procedures.
 
 
McKinley School has a full
-
time Principal, a full
-
time 
Assistant Principal, and a part
-
time Assistant Principal who equally share the responsibilities of 
providing a safe and positive campus by supervising students, monitoring the campus for potentially unsafe situations, enforc
ing safety policies, and 
oversee
ing the implementation of safety procedures.   McKinley School also has two full
-
time Counselors, an In
-
School Suspension Teacher, an 
Instructional Coach, and a full
-
time Program Specialist who are actively involved in the development and enforcement of sa
fety procedures.
 
 
McKinley School gets support from SUSD Police Department and Stockton Police Department when necessary for any unsafe or unla
wful situations.  For 
emergencies, there is no hesitation to call 911.   Also, McKinley School is fortunate to ha
ve access to a Stockton Police Department Chaplain who is 
available upon request.
 
 
McKinley School has 6 noon
-
duty supervisors.  On any given day, 1
-
3 parents help with the supervision of students in the cafeteria and/or the playground. 
In addition, there 
are two (2) full
-
time Campus Security Assistants (CSA).  In conjunction, the CSA and the noon
-
duty supervisors help enforce school 
rules, monitor the implementation of safety procedures, and supervise students during all transitions to include a recess, lu
nch, and passing periods. 
Noon
-
duty supervisors enforce school safety rules and procedures. The CSAs also inspect school property, report graffiti and vanda
lism, escort and direct 
authorized visitors to desired destinations, escort students to and from adm
inistrative offices, retrieve students as requested by administrators, and 
assist with helping all visitors to follow site safety procedures. The noon
-
duty supervisors and CSAs are CPR/First Aid trained so that they are better 
prepared for an emergency. CS
As attend yearly training by SUSD Police Department.   The safety staff meets frequently with the administration to 
communicate any concerns in regards to the school climate and safety and problem
-
solve ways to make McKinley a safer place to learn and work
.
 
 
McKinley School has formed a Positive Behavior Interventions & Supports (PBIS) Team, which meets monthly to review discipline
 
data and review 
incentive programs for positive behavior.  The team, led by the Assistant Principal, has re
-
evaluated the schoo
l
-
wide behavior management system, 
revamped and refined current practices, and aligned common goals and expectations throughout the common areas of the campus a
nd individual 
classrooms.  The team also plans many school spirit activities for our student bod
y.
 
 
 

havior Interventions & 
Supports (PBIS) and the premise of being Safe, Organized, Accountable, and Respectful (SOAR). It is our
 
goal to provide quality instruction in a safe, 
positive environment for all students. McKinley School implements a comprehensive school safety plan assuring all members of 


iness and Emergency Management (revised 9/2018) identifies procedures to follow 
during emergencies and natural disasters. Emergency drills are conducted on a regular basis. Parent training workshops are co
nducted each year to share 
emergency plan procedure
s, responsibilities, and expectations. Tabletop training for faculty and staff is conducted yearly, and teachers train the st
udents 
on proper procedures in case of emergencies. In the event of a school emergency, the principal notifies appropriate site and
 
district personnel. School 
and district safety protocol based on the Readiness and Emergency Management (REMS) plan is followed.
