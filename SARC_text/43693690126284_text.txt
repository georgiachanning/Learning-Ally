Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements 
(Most Recent Year)
 
 
The District makes every effort to ensure all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the district
 
uses 
a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. 
The results of this 
survey are available at the school office and at the district office.
 
 
The building in which Renaissance resides was built in 1959. School facilities are being renovated according to the Field 
Act requirements of the State Building Code
 
with a focus on earthquake safety. In the event that asbestos and lead 
containing building materials are found, they are removed according to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), State, 
and Local requirements. Deferred maintenance funds have been used t
o properly maintain and renovate district buildings. 
Needed repairs and maintenance projects are completed in a timely manner.
 
 
Whenever possible, school facilities are upgraded to support and maintain a safe, clean and secure campus. Sufficient 
classroom,
 

the instructional program. The Alum Rock Union Elementary School District maintenance staff, in conjunction with day 
and night custodians, e
nsure the school buildings and grounds are safe, clean, and in good repair. Rigorous daily custodial 
schedules ensure that classrooms, lavatories, serving kitchens, eating areas, offices, and playgrounds are clean for both 
student and staff use.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP]
 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight
 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant co
gnitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or program
s 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Renaissance community works hard to ensure all students are safe. Renaissance has a very detailed, comprehensive 
safety 
plan that outlines protocols, systems, and procedures in the event of any/all emergencies. The plan also contains 
the yearly safety goals as determined by the students, staff, and parents. The safety plan is developed by the Renaissance 
Safety Committee, p
resented to the School Site Council and then sent to the Alum Rock Union Elementary School District 
Board of Trustees for approval. The revised plan was last approved in November 2017 and was approved through the end 
of the 2019
-
2020 school year. The safet
y plan and drill procedures are reviewed during the year with all staff. Safety alerts 
are shared with all staff as needed throughout the school year. In addition, all required drills are calendared and 
completed, and the results are shared with the staff.
 
When guests are visiting Renaissance, they first check in at the office 
and are required to wear a visitor pass while spending time on campus. The Renaissance staff follows a yard
-
duty schedule 
to ensure that students are well supervised before school, du
ring brunch, during lunch, and at dismissal. The Renaissance 
safety plan has a comprehensive, enforceable, continuous behavior policy, rules and regulations, dress code policy, 
protocols for safety/emergency drills, tardy policy, attendance policy, referra
l policy, and nondiscriminatory policy on 
student rights and responsibilities. The safety plan is revised annually.
