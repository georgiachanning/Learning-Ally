By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
San Miguel is a community school model with 4 core tenets.  1.  Strong instructional practice, 2. Positive school culture, 3.
 
Home/school partnership, and 4. Community programs and partnerships.  We
 
are also home to the Juntos Program, 
Sunnyvale School District's 2
-
Way Dual Immersion Spanish/English Program.
 
 
San Miguel Elementary School is a great place for students to be challenged academically, develop a growth mindset, and 
nourish passions and in
terests.
 
 
In the spring of 2014, we were named an Ashoka Changemaker School based on our work around developing social and 
emotional well
-
being for our students and staff. Changemaker Schools are known for their ability to promote and teach 
empathy, teamwo
rk, problem solving, and leadership. We believe that by creating a community school environment, we 
can support our students, parents, community, and staff in closing the opportunity and achievement gaps that exists today 
in America and in our community.  
We are also a California Gold Ribbon School, a Santa Clara County Hoffman Award 
Winner, and a California School Board Association Golden Bell Winner.
 
 
We currently have approximately 420 students enrolled from Transitional Kindergarten (TK) through Fifth g
rade. In 2015, 

through fifth grade and students in Juntos beginning in Kindergarten with cohorts to grow through the 6 years that they 
are at
 
San Miguel.  Our students enroll at San Miguel from every home school in Sunnyvale School District.
 
 
Our students have a well
-
rounded enriching experience during the school day that includes all core content areas but also 
extends into Drama, Dance, Music
, Visual Arts, Physical Education, and developing mindfulness and a growth mindset. 
Our students are also working on becoming 21st century learners. With our Common Core Standards adoption, we are 
also working on deepening student understanding and knowled
ge past rote memorization to the levels of critical thinking 
and analysis. We utilize technology to foster 21st century skills with an individual Chrome Book or iPad for each child in 
grades TK
-
5th.
 
 
We have worked extensively to bring in programs and 
develop partnerships that enrich our school environment and our 
community within the school day and outside the school day. We are proud to say that we have over 35 various programs 
and partnerships with local and national organizations. Some highlights in
clude a partnership with the YMCA to have all 
of our third graders participate in water safety lessons so that they can learn how to swim, and dental care for adults and 
children on campus.  We are a great school where our students continue to make academi
c, emotional, and social gains.  
We are also a school that provides a number of resources to our greater community that in turn supports our families, 
students, and staff.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At San Miguel we welcome and encourage parent involvement in and outside the classroom.  Parents are able to volunteer 
by working with students, prepping materials, or helping organize school or class events.  Moms and dads, grandmas, 
grandpas and any othe
r family member can come in at the times that work in their busy schedules.  We also have an active 
Parent Teacher Association (PTA), which hosts a variety of school
-
wide events such as our Walk
-
A
-
Thon, Winterland 
Dance, Monthly Dine Out Nights, and more. 
 
It takes a village to raise a child and it takes many hands to make our school 
great.
 
 
Some ways families can become involved at San Miguel:
 

 
Attending and being involved in our English Learner Advisory Council (ELAC) meetings
 

 
Attending and being 
involved in our Parent Teacher Association (PTA) meetings
 

 
Volunteering in the classroom
 

 
Prepping materials at home
 

 
Being a Room Parent

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
San Miguel has a Comprehensive School Safety Plan to ensure a safe and orderly environment. The plan was last updated 
December 2019. The goals outlined in the plan are:
 
1.
 
To develop a climate and culture of safety, responsibility, respect and caring as measu
red by the number of office 
referrals.
 
2.
 
To develop procedures and routines that are regularly practiced in case of an emergency.
 
 
Staff and parents were instrumental in formulating this plan and ongoing monitoring is via the Positive Behavior and 
Interventi
on Support (PBIS) Committee.  We examine our Social Emotional Well Being data via the California Healthy Kids 
Survey, Project Cornerstone, or Panorama surveys.

Teachers participate in at least three full days of professional development during the school year. In addition, there are 
monthly teacher learning days, when students are released early to provide additional time for focused professional 
development. Fin
ally, all teachers participate in district
-
wide professional development three times a year with grade level 
colleagues. The principal, assistant principal, site instructional coaches, and district coaches work with teachers to model 
and plan lessons, and 
teachers are encouraged to observe their colleagues to improve their instructional practice. 
Teachers meet with the principal at least three times a year to discuss student progress.
 
 
All professional development is tied to our school goals. Recent profess
ional development activities include:
