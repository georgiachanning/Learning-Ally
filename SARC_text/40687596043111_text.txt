Description
 
Shell Beach Elementary School is located in the beautiful coastal community of Shell Beach, California.  Our 
school serves students from across the Five Cities area,  Nipomo, and San Luis Obispo.  Though our school 
continues  to grow (we curren
tly have approximately 380 students), we continue to maintain a "small school" 
feel.  This small school feel is due in large part to our dedicated team of teacher, parents, and community 
volunteers.   Teachers take a vested interest in our students and dev
elop lasting relationships with students 
and families.  Parents play a critical role in the success of our students.  On any given day, more than 15 parent 
volunteers work in classes across our school.  These parents not only provide teacher support in cop
ying, 
creating materials, organizing materials but more importantly provide small group instruction in classes where 
appropriate. Over time, we have developed strong community partnerships with the Pismo Police 
Department, Cal Poly, and local businesses. T
hese community partnerships help students to feel a part of the 
larger community and provides an outlet for enriching learning opportunities.
 
 
Certificated:
 
Our team consists of one TK teacher, two Kindergarten teachers, 2 first grade teachers, 3 second gr
ade 
teachers, 2 third grade teachers, two 4th grade teachers, two fifth grade teachers, and 2 sixth grade teachers. 
Our average class sizes in our primary classes is 22, while our average class size in our intermediate grades is 
26.  In addition to our gen
eral education classes listed above, we also have one full time resource teacher.  We 
are also proud to run to the district's Therapeutic Learning Class which serves some of our district's most 
behaviorally challenged students in grades K
-
5.
 
 
Classified:
 
O
ur teaching staff is further enhanced by a team of devoted classified staff members.  Our classified team 
includes a full time secretary and a part
-
time attendance secretary.  Our librarian's thirty hour week allows us 
to encourage a love of literacy while
 
our School Technology Assistant's 25 hours a week is devoted to providing 
students with much needed digital citizenship and computer skills. Our playground supervisor ensures our 
students have a safe environment in which to play and grow.  Their focus on 
identifying and recognizing 
positive character traits in our students help to foster more positive playground behaviors.  Our TK and K 
classes are supported by three hour Instructional Assistants (IAs) who work diligently to support student 
learning.  Our 
students who require additional assistance through IEPs have access to a committed group of 
eight IAs who collaborate with teachers to ensure individual student needs are met.  A full
-
time day custodian 
and a part
-
time evening custodian rounds out our clas
sified staff.
 
 
Support Staff:
 
Our team wouldn't be complete without the support provided by a variety of other team members.  Our part
-
time School Nurse plays an integral role in ensuring our students are healthy and safe as well as providing 
much needed l
earning to staff on a variety of health
-
related issues.  We have two part
-
time counselors 
providing small group counseling to students struggling with a variety of issues including divorce, grief, 
anger/impulsivity issues, and social isolation.  The counse
lors also work with teachers to develop and deliver 
classroom lessons on a wide range of topics. Our part
-
time school therapist provides students with individual 
counseling.  Our part
-
time Speech Pathologist, School Psychologist, and Occupational Therapist
 
are vital to the 
success of some of our neediest students.
 
 
Mission
 
Through intentional collaboration between students, staff, families, and the community, Shell Beach 
Elementary School is committed to empowering our students through 21st century skills t
o have a positive 
impact on our global society.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Safety concerns are a
 
top priority of maintenance and operations. District maintenance supervisors are proactive and conduct inspections at school 
sites 
on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner
. A work
-
order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.

am is admini
stered 
by Lucia Mar Unified School District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well maintained and provide a suitable 
learning environment. A 
summary of these standards is available at the school office or at the District office.

Parent Involvement
 
 
S
hell Beach Elementary is proud to promote a culture that makes families feel welcome.  Parents have a variety of ways to get 
involved at the school.  
Parents can join our PTO or serve on School Site Council. Our success as a school community relies heavily
 
on the efforts of our PTO.  Our PTO hosts two 
major fundraiser events every year.  Our Jog
-
A
-
Thon in the fall brings families together at the beginning of the school year.  This year's event raised more 
than $29,000.  These funds allow for extra support s
ervices such as an Instructional Aide in Kindergarten, additional yard supervision, and the 
aforementioned art and music services. Our second fundraiser is our annual parent auction.
 
 
If committee work does not sound appealing, parents can volunteer in the
 
classroom or in the office.  Classroom volunteers spend time reading with 
students, leading small groups, and working on arts/crafts.  Office volunteers help with copies, laminating, and other front 
office tasks.
 
 
School Site Council also provides another
 
opportunity for parents to get involved.
 
 
Our volunteers put in hundreds of hours every week to help make Shell Beach the best place possible for children.

We know that a strong network of family support is critical to our students' we
ll
-
being.  With that in mind, we offer several different family events 
throughout the year to promote a bond between school and home.  In addition to the traditional Back to School Night and Open 
House, we offer a Catch 
the Wave event which takes place bef
ore school starts.  This event connects families, gives them a chance to learn about things are doing, and find out 
their teacher placement.  This event is well attended with about 250 of our families attending each year.  Connections are al
so fostered thr
ough our 
annual Family Picnic event.  This event takes place in the fall and allows families to come and have lunch with their childre
n.  This, too, is a well attended 
event with close to 300 people joining us for a family picnic lunch.  Our annual Art in 
the Dark, which highlights artwork of our TK
-
3rd grade students is 
always a family favorite as well as families roam the halls looking at students art work, enjoy holiday music, grab a snack o
r two, and visit our book fair.  
Our book fair is a another fami
ly favorite event each year.  Hosting the book fair every year not only helps to promote a love for literacy, but also allows
 
students to develop a sense of autonomy in their reading. This event, hosted twice a year, serves as a give
-
back to the teachers t
hrough earning books 
as well as through the purchase of an annual subscription to Time for Kids.  Monthly restaurant hosted give
-
back night are another way to bring the 
school community together. This year we also added a Fall Festival which was attended b
y 250 people and included games for students and food for all. 
Finally, we have had one Beautification Day so far this year in which hundreds of parents, students and community members gav
e back to the school by 
increasing the size of our school garden, pa
inting all over the school, adding plants to the front of the school and creating a Kindness Rock Garden at the 
entrance of the school.

Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the District to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The Plan pr
ovides students and 
staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 within
 
their Safe School Plans: 
current status of school crime; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, both routine
 
and emergency; policies related to suspension and 
expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a schoolwide dress code; safe ingress and egress 
of pupils, parents, and school 
employees; safe and orderly school environment; a
nd school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and updates it as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Pla
n, are reviewed with school 
and District staff in the fall, at the start of each school year.

Career Technical Education Programs
 
The Board of Education realized that students have varying 
academic interests and aptitudes, and that they need to be better prepared for options other 
than a four
-
year university directly from high school, particularly in light of the rapidly changing workforce technology and employment 
environments in 
many indus
try sectors. Therefore, the Board of Education sought to support Programs of Study to ensure that all students graduating fro
m the Lucia Mar 
Unified School District have the preparation necessary for success in any post
-
secondary pursuit, whether it is uni
versity studies, technical training, 
workforce placement, military enlistment, or service as a community volunteer. 
 
 
As vocational education evolved in the 21st century, it became known as Career Technical Education (CTE). Business owners, tr
ade union lea
ders and 
educators came together to change how occupational and technical subject matter were delivered in high school, college and te
chnical training 
environments. This resulted in the need to develop robust and rigorous curriculum provided in a cyclical 
continuum that engages participants in the most 
common tasks and skills required in a broad umbrella of employment opportunities within a specific industry sector. High Scho
ol Career Pathways provide 
the first two to three years of instruction and skill de
velopment in this scenario.

Pathway programs in LMUSD are designed so that students are able to gain at least one industry certification, or equivalent s
kill measurement, to provide 
a competitive advantage in the job market. Additionally, curriculum will
 
coincide with community college career certificate and associate degree 
programs in same/similar industry areas and in some cases allow students to earn college credit for their coursework while st
ill in high school. This will 
shorten the time it takes st
udents to earn post
-
secondary degrees/certificates and enter the skilled workforce. The California Department of Education 
gives guidance for the design of model CTE programs in their plan for Career Technical Education, which was adopted by the St
ate Boar
d of Education in 
2008. 
 
 
The same quality program indicators were taken into consideration during the development of career pathway programs of study 
for LMUSD. Specifically, 
the focus of pathway preparation has been on assessing current programs and 
facilities, establishing relationships with industry members and assembling 
advisory committees for new programs, reviewing and developing curriculum, reviewing instructor training needs, determining o
utreach/communication 
needs, and researching funding op
tions for new and existing pathway programs. 
 
 
The Director of CTE provides direct support to instructors, pathway programs, and site administration in the areas of curricu
lum, facility and equipment, 
postsecondary alignment, industry partnerships, and ove
rall pathway focus. CTE teachers participate in professional development to stay up to date with 
changes in industry by attending workshops, conferences, and other training opportunities. Additionally, CTE instructors focu
s on pathway development 
and philo
sophy, which include California State CTE Frameworks and model standards, as well as funding legislation that affects the str
uctural make up of 
CTE programs. This baseline of CTE supports has continued to improve annually in the support of current programs
 
that are functioning well, retooling 
programs that have minor areas of weakness, building out viable pathways from programs that currently function as a single co
urse, and establish new 
programs where programs do not exist but there is a regional workforc
e need. 
 
 
Several CTE programs participate in Career Technical Student Organization (CTSO) activities and competitions through the Futu
re Farmers of America 
(FFA), SkillsUSA, and HOSA. The Culinary Arts, Agriculture, Design, Visual, Media Arts, and Animati
on programs have all had regional contest student 
winners, who competed in the various categories at the state level. Industry recognized certifications include CPR, First Aid
, Food Handlers, Serv Safe, 
Adobe, and CAD. Students also have the opportunity to
 
earn college credit toward a degree within their field of study and some pathways offering 
multiple college courses. Additionally, students are able to build resumes and portfolios with unique projects that demonstra
te their level of expertise 
with indust
ry desired skills. Through continually expanding internship programs available in various pathways, students are able to gain
 
real world 
experience within their field of study that often times leads to employment.
