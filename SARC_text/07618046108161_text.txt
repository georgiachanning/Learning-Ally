Principal's Message
 
Welcome to Golden View Elementary School. I want to 
extend our warmest greetings to you and 
your family. Here at Golden View Elementary School, we are a family. Our staff is highly qualified, 
skilled and committed to working collaboratively to promote high academic success. We have 
active parent organizatio
ns that coordinate activities to bring our families and staff together, in 
addition to raising funds to support our instructional programs. It is our collective goal to create an 
enriching learning environment that engages every student.
 
 
We encourage pare
nt volunteers in our classrooms and on our campus. Our Parent
-
Teacher 
Association (PTA), our site
-
based education fund (Gator Fund) and our School Site Council (SSC) all 
work hand
-
in
-
hand with staff to provide exceptional programs to enrich and support the
 
classroom 
instruction.
 
 
As principal at Golden View, I am proud to share that our test scores continue to rise. Our school 
facilities are beautiful and every classroom is equipped with cutting edge technology. We are 
committed to not only preparing your s
tudents for a world that requires global competency and 
high academic standards, but also to meeting the social and emotional needs of your children.
 
 
Golden View has a diverse student population; we believe that this diversity helps us to prepare 
our stud
ents for work in a global economy. We stress respect for different cultures, customs, and 
beliefs as we learn and work together. We have many events and celebrations planned throughout 
the year. I encourage you to visit our school website for up to date in

It is an honor to work with the staff, students, families, and community. Again, I welcome you to 
Golden View Elementary School.
 
 
Sincerely,

About the SARC
 
By Fe
bruary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Fu
nding Formula (LCFF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address stat
e and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the 
school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or the district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

monthly basis throughout the school year. Lockdown drills are held once a year.
 
 
Students are supervised before and after school by certificated staff; classified staff, parent
 
volunteers and the principal supervise students during lunch. 
Parent volunteers also help with supervision during lunch.  There is a designated area for student drop off and pick up. Visi
tors must sign in and out at 
the office and must wear name badges wh
ile on campus. Parent volunteers are required to attend a training and to clear a district wide volunteer 
clearance through Be A Mentor before working in the classroom.

The San Ramon Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a comprehensive, inclusive model of 
professional development for all staff. Our high 
quality professional development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy and in
structional strategies. 
In 2012
-
13, we established district
-
wide K
-
12 Task Forces 
in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along with targeted professional 
development offerings. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and t
he Silicon Valley Math 
Initiative. 
Both organizations are highly respected and have strong ties to the development and implementation of the CCSS and profession
al learning 
offerings.
 
These learning experiences are supported with on
-
site coaching provided by a team of instructional coaches w
ho work and train together. The coaches 
received certification as Common Core trainers through the Leadership and Learning Center. They provide one
-
to
-
one coaching, team and grade level 
coaching, whole school professional development, in addition to target
ed cross
-
grade level, cross
-
discipline professional development sessions. These 
trainings connect to every aspect of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
formative assessment for 
learning, and lesson desig
n.

In addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach
-
led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting. 
These cohorts are both semester
-
long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut
 
from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for 
Innovators to Problem Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously.
 
 
We ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project (formerly known a
s BTSA). Our summer intensive 
trainings along with on
-
going staff development days and release day trainings deeply align with the needs of our individual schools and our Framewor
k 
for Excellence: Supporting Students and their Learning; Supporting Staff an
d their Work.
 
 
Under the leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to d
eepen their content 
knowledge, strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and fo
ster a shared sense of responsibility. As a result, every 
staff member helps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the district as a w
hole is enhanced.
