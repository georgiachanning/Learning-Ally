School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions a
nd Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Nueva Vista Language Academy provides a safe, orderly and clean environment for learning. The school has sufficient and 
adequate classroom space, and the playground is equipped with a play structure, 
multiple basketball courts, tetherballs, 
swings and a field for open field sports. In addition, the school site has a multi
-
purpose/cafeteria facility and a cement 
area for assemblies and school gatherings.
 
 
The Maintenance, Operations and 
Transportation (MOT) department works daily with the custodial staff to develop 
cleaning schedules to ensure clean and safe schools. Nueva Vista has one daytime custodian, two evening custodians, and 
a district crew who ensure that the grounds and building
s are clean, repaired, and safe. All bathrooms, classrooms, and 
offices are cleaned on a daily basis. The district utilizes an electronic work order system


expediting repairs.
 
 
The district also participates in the State Scho
ol Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on 
a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school 
building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbi
ng, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or 
exterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
At Nueva Vista, the district, site staff, students and parents take great pride in their campus; therefore, everyone 
contributes to the beautification of 
the school. Students are also encouraged to help keep the campus clean by recycling.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
T
he percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Nueva Vista Language Academy has developed a school wide Comprehensive Safe School Plan that outlines emergency 
procedures and protocols for students, teachers and parents. The school safety plan is reviewed on an
 
yearly basis and

plan on a yearly basis.
 
 
Key elements of the school plan include:
 

 
Child abuse reporting procedures
 

 
School discipline, suspension, and expulsion procedures
 

 
Procedures for teacher notification of students who have been suspended
 

 
Sexual harassment policy (students and staff)
 

 
Dress code guidelines
 

 
Procedures for safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents an
d employees to and from school
 
Monthly safety drills are practiced with students to ensure their understanding of all emergency procedures. Drills include 
action plans for fires, earthquakes, and major disasters. The School Safety Plan was reviewed and una
nimously approved 
at a public meeting by the School Site Council on February 19, 2019 and will be reviewed again in January 2020.

Nueva Vista Language Academy uses data to plan and prepare to meet the diverse needs of their students.  Teachers use 
data from many sources such as SBAC scores, ELPAC scores, reading inventories, and districts assessments to prepare 
goals and actions to m
eet the needs of their students.  Each grade level creates action plans that are monitored and 
updated on a continuous basis.  From there, professional development is offered to teachers to ensure they are able to 
meet the goals and actions set by the grad
e levels.  For the 2019
-
2020 school year, the primary focus for professional 
development is the use of Thinking Maps, AVID strategies, Putting It All Together math strategies, and Social and Emotional 
supports for students which include topics on bullying 
prevention.
 
 
Professional development is delivered during after school extended time, district allotted time during late starts and 
during the course of the instructional day with the use of substitute teachers. Teachers are supported through coaching, 
dat
a talks, walk
-
through observations, and feedback.
 
 
During the past three years the following was dedicated to staff development: 2017
-
2018: 10 days; 2018
-
2019: 10 days; 
2019
