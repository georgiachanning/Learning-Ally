By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

as well as language and technological skills. We will provide 
the rigorous educational opportunities necessary to mold all 
students into lifelong learners.
 
 
School Mission:
 
Williamson Elementary will provide a high
-
quality, standards
-

School & Community Profile:
 
Williamson Elementary School is located east of Sacramento along the Highway 50 corridor in the city of Rancho Cordova. 
Williamson Elementary has a rich heritage of community pride, family involvement, and neighborhood
 
charm. The campus 
presents an inviting landscape with beautiful large trees and colorful murals. Located in Rancho Cordova, Williamson is 
one of twenty elementary schools in the Folsom Cordova Unified School District. The district serves approximately 19,
500 
students.
 
 
Williamson Elementary School's student enrollment as of September 2019 is 580 students in preschool through 5th grade. 
Our school has many different cultural groups and languages including Spanish, Russian, Armenian, Ukrainian, and many 
others. Learning extends beyond the core curriculum of reading, math, social studies, and science. Our 4th and 5th
-
grade 
students receive twice weekly music instruction. All classrooms and the library are connected to the Internet and students 
use the comp
uters in a variety of ways. The strong parent and community support we receive help reinforce the goal of 
providing an excellent educational program in a warm, caring, and safe environment. School spirit abounds on campus as 
the Williamson student body par
ticipates in special spirit days planned by the student leadership group. Williamson offers 
extra support for teachers and students with the addition of a full
-
time Assistant Principal in 2017. We also have a full
-
time Academic Coach and Intervention teach
er who help deliver specialized academic instruction to small groups of 
students. In 2016, we went to  1:1 ratio for student technology. Each child has access to their own Chromebook in their 
classroom.
 
 
The most current California Department of Education 
(CDE) Ethnicity data: 12.9% African American, 1.6% Asian, 0.9% 
Filipino, 40.1% Hispanic/Latino, 2.5% Pacific Islander, 29.1% White, 11.3% Two Or More Races and 1.6% Declined to State. 
As you can see from this data, Williamson Elementary has a very diverse 
population of students. Hispanic/Latino is our 
largest represented ethnic group. We translate all school communication into Spanish. Our robust English Language 
Advisory Committee (ELAC) group serves our diverse population. We currently have Spanish, Russi
an, Ukrainian, and 
Armenian translators on campus daily.

Social

emotional learning is an important component of the overall educational program at Williamson and we commit to 
helping students learn the following: Show Respect, Make Good Decisions, and Sol
ve Problems. Our Reflection Room is 
open to all students at their morning recess. Trained teachers and instructional assistants work individually and with small 
groups of children that may need extra practice and time to be successful with our school rules
 
of Respectfulness, On Task 
and Always Safe Behavior, followed with Responsibility. Teachers can assign this support or students may self select to 
attend during morning recess time.
 
 
We encourage our community to continue to assist Williamson in our effor
ts to reach our goals for ongoing improvement. 
We will actively seek out new community partnerships to leverage connections for student support. We know with 
everyone's support and assistance our students will become positive members of our community for y
ears to come. 
Success is everyone's job!

Parents have the opportunity to participate in the school community in many ways. One of the most important is as a 
member of the School Site Council (SSC). The SSC meets three times per year and is responsible for writing and monitoring 
the School Plan fo
r Student Achievement (SPSA). Another extremely important group is our Williamson Parent Teacher 
Association (PTA). Families are encouraged to participate in and help with Family Nights, special activities, and fundraisers
. 
The English Language Advisory Co
mmittee (ELAC) meets several times per year to discuss and make plans to meet the 
needs of English Learners (EL). Parents may volunteer in the classroom, the library, or in the office on a one
-
time or a 
regular basis and are also welcome on field trips onc
e they have district clearance which includes a clear Tuberculosis (TB) 

survey.

Each employee is encouraged to grow 
professionally through self evaluation and reflection; by attending college and 
university classes as well as statewide workshops; by reading professional literature; and by networking. District and 
school sponsored in
-
services, conferences, and trainings 
are provided through Professional Development (PD), a model of 
lead teachers and site level reading, math, science and technology coaches. In addition, our district staff has worked 
collaboratively to implement our Peer Assistance Review (PAR) program, whi
ch works in unison with Beginning Teacher 
Support and Assessment (BTSA) to provide an induction program for qualified new teachers. We support our teachers in 
pursuing National Board Certification and currently have over 44 National Board Certified teacher
s within the district. The 
district is involved with both Administrator Training Program (ATP) and Teacher Training, which increase the capacity of 
all staff to deliver a standards
-
based curriculum.
 
 
Counseling & Support Staff
 
 
It is the goal of Williamson
 
Elementary to assist students in their social and personal development as well as academics. 
The school gives special attention to students who experience achievement problems, difficulty coping with personal and 
family problems, trouble with decision mak
ing, or handling peer pressure.
 
 
The professional development provided for the staff includes: release time for key standard planning in Benchmark English 
Learner Arts (ELA). We have two release days planned for the 20178/2018 school year and will be apply
ing for two more 
release days so teachers can continue digging into our new ELA adoption and identifying resources that support the 
essential standards. Each grade level team is currently in the process of identifying essential ELA standards and then 
creat
ing assessments to support student learning of the essential standards. Though this process, the teachers also are 
developing a plan of remediation when the essential standards are not met by the students. The teachers will also be 
finishing a book study o
f the book, "Simplifying the Response to Intervention (RTI)" by Mike Mattos. Williamson has 
implemented a Multi Tiered System of Support (MTSS) to address instruction and  student learning.
