School Description
 
Murray Elementary, established in 1965, is one of eight elementary schools in Dublin and serves a population 
of 620 students in a suburban community, which is located approximately 40 miles east of San Francisco. Our 
vision at Murray is to provide a caring
 
environment where the value of learning and working together is 
understood and visible everywhere. Our goal is to provide a challenging, positive, and safe learning 
environment that promotes student academic achievement, social growth, and the development
 
of lifelong 
learners. A caring atmosphere is evident in all we do. Our staff members and our Parent Faculty Club have a 
strong commitment to the education of all students. As a professional learning community we encourage 
continuous improvement in our pra
ctice and strive to create a rich, inviting environment.
 
 
This year we will continue to use Professional Learning Communities to create Common Formative 
Assessments and a strong Response to Intervention program. Our teachers use the Response to Interventio
n 
model to provide targeted instruction. Our teachers believe that their own training is critical to the continued 
success of our students. Our test scores demonstrate our ability to achieve and maintain high standards. We 
have provided options for our stu
dents, such as our successful Pathways classes for kindergartners through 

provides a rigorous and relevant education for all students in grades devel
opmental kindergarten through 
fifth.

Types of Services Funded
 
Our School and Library Improvement funds pay for one extra hour for our media technician and for tea
cher 
training, instructional supplies, and student support expenses. Our Parent Faculty Club raises funds for 
classroom supplies, field trips, library books, and special assemblies through our annual fundraisers. Our 
teachers receive funding grants from co
mpanies such as Wells Fargo and our Dublin Partners in Education. 
They use this funding to promote their special programs and for our Elementary Peace Program.
 
 
Federal Title One funds are allocated to schools for the purpose of providing all children with
 
an equitable and 
high
-
quality education.  At Murray Elementary, our Title One funds support:  vocabulary
-
rich reading books, 
Starfall Reading materials, Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA) kits, Scholastic Skilled Reading Kits, and 
Curriculum Associate
s assessment materials. We also provide a highly qualified teacher to work with grades 
1

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Murray Elementary is a developmental kindergarten through fifth grade school 
built in 1965. We have a total of 21 permanent structure classrooms, 9 
portables, a spacious library, a computer lab housing 33 stations and a multipurpose room with stage and adjoining kitchen. A
dditionally, we have the 
offices for administration, speech,
 
ELL and our school psychologist. For teacher use we have a conference room, teacher work room, two resource book 
rooms and a staff lounge. We have a large athletic field utilized by both the school and the city.
 
 
We have a full time custodian on campus du

inviting campus.
 
 
We remodeled the office in the summer of 2014 and staff lounge in 2002. During the 2007
-
2008 school year t
he Dublin Unified School District planned 
$9.5 million dollars in renovations for Murray Elementary School. The scope and sequence of the project encompassed replacing
 
the roof, doors, and 
windows on campus. Construction took place during the summer of 200
9. As of fall 2010, Murray is equipped with brand new heating, ventilation, and 
air conditioning units. In the summer of 2014 a brand new 84 space parking lot was completed. Additionally, the entire front 
of the school was landscaped 
using reclaimed water.
 
in 2014, a new 5 classroom Kindergarten wing was added. in 2017, 6 portables were added to house increasing enrollment.
 
 
The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar
 
basis, to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this in
cludes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor
 
systems.

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students w
ho met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by th
e total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to pr
otect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level p
ercentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who received scores.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We have many ways for parents to participate in the life o
f our school, and we depend on parents to keep our programs running smoothly. Our parents 
commit time in our classrooms, many on a weekly basis, providing extra help in reading, math and science. Our visitor logbook
 
is testimony to thousands 
of hours of re
corded assistance. Room parents organize parent volunteers to help with special projects in the classroom and chaperone on fi
eld trips. 
We buy new books for the library through Parent Faculty Club fundraisers.
 
 
Our parents join District committees, serve o
n our School Site Council, and actively participate in after school sports. We ask all parents to attend Back
-
to
-
School Night in the fall and parent
-
teacher conferences in the fall.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Sc
hool Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Staff monitors the school grounds for 15 minutes before school as well as at all recesses and at lunchtime.
 
We have five noon supervisors that monitor 

teach safe, responsible 
behavior in school and on the playground. These are posted in a
ll classrooms and hallways to reinforce them with students. Visitors enter the school 
through the main door and sign in at the office, where they receive a visitor label to wear throughout their stay. All parent
s must pass a volunteer 
clearance before they
 
can drive on field trips or work in the classroom.

We revise our school safety plan annually. It is revised annually and reviewed with staff. The plan includes procedures for e
mergencies, exit routes, and 
inventories of emergency supplies. We make the pl
an available to all teachers and keep copies in the office for parents. We share the plan with all staff 
during our October staff meeting, which includes reminders regarding intruders, playground emergencies, and evacuation proced
ures. We practice fire, 
ea
rthquake, and lockdown drills monthly.
 
 
We repack classroom emergency backpacks with designated supplies and current class lists each September. Plans for our safety
 
include a yearly 
inventory of our emergency shed, setting the drill calendar for the year,
 
updating our substitute folders, and assigning tasks to each staff member. We 
maintain emergency supplies on campus in the event of a severe emergency.

Dedicated staff development days are scheduled on the school

year calendar during the negotiation process between the District and the teachers 
association. Content for two of the three days is usually determined by the District based on areas of focus, te

strategic plan. Teachers and administrators also review test scores of the previous year to assist in reviewing and modifying
 
instructional programs. The 
third staff development day is determined in collaboration 
between the staff and principal.
 
 
Additional staff development opportunities take place during trainings where teachers are released through use of substitutes
 
to attend workshops or 
conferences, at District sponsored  after
 
school workshops, during grade level collaboration, and via site

based coaches.
