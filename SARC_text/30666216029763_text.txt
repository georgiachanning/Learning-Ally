By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Crescent Elementary is one of 27 elementary schools in the Orange Unified School District and we are on a modified 
traditional calendar.  Built in 1967, and previously operating as two separa
te schools (a K
-
3 school and a 4th 
-
 
6th grade 
school), we are now a transitional kindergarten through sixth grade school situated on one campus.  The school is in an 
idyllic setting, nestled next to a park, in a residential area in the northwest corner of
 
Anaheim Hills.  Approximately 765 
students are enrolled in grades TK through sixth during the 2019
-
2020 school year. Our student population is ethnically 
diverse and includes seven GATE (Gifted and Talented Education) classes in grades 3 
-
 
6.   We value a
nd honor our cultural 
diversity and are proud of the cross
-
cultural participation in school events. We provide a strong, integrated curriculum 
with language as the centerpiece of learning. We focus upon the development of a balance of skills, knowledge, an
d 
understanding.
 
 
It is our pleasure to invite you to read our School Accountability Report Card.  Our staff models the belief that learning is
 
a life
-
long journey.  We have a strategic framework for whole school improvement based upon an analysis of stude
nt 
achievement and the selection of research
-
based instructional strategies.  Teachers are trained in a variety of instructional 
strategies with an emphasis on the research
-
based "Thirteen Effective Strategies" by Robert Marzano and the Common 
Core 5 C's: 
 
collaboration, critical thinking, communication, creativity and character.  We recognize that to empower our 
students and prepare them for the demands of the future, we also need to empower ourselves.  We have an Instructional 
Leadership Team (ILT), which
 
meets regularly to guide our staff through the process of using effective research
-
proven 
teaching practices.  We have a fully equipped computer lab with enough computers so that every student has their own 
while in the lab. Technology is used to increase
 
and enhance student and teacher access to information, their ability to 
use data, their productivity and their creativity.
 
 
Our Crescent families and staff share a common vision to create a community of life
-
long learners who possess strong 
character trai
ts of respect and responsibility.  The staff is committed to treating students with dignity and creating an 
environment that provides maximum opportunities for learning.  Our goal is to provide students with a strong educational 
foundation so that they lea
ve Crescent Elementary with educational experiences that have prepared students 
academically, and instilled the problem
-
solving and critical thinking skills necessary to become successful 21st Century 
learners.  We provide each student with a challenging a
nd rigorous curriculum that addresses Academic Content 
Performance Standards. We believe every child can achieve academic success. Our staff is dedicated to providing every 
student with quality instructional experiences which recognize, support, and mainta
in high expectations. Our school 
district provides staff development and support district wide.
 
 
Mission Statement:  In partnership with parents and community, we share a commitment to provide a positive and 
engaging school climate and culture focused on s
tudent achievement, social
-
emotional well
-
being, student connectedness 
and strong character and citizenship for the 21st Century.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Crescent Elementary is proud of the generous support and involvement of its parents and community.  Parents volunteer 
at Crescent in the classroom, at assemblies, health screenings and a number of other activities. Parents serve on the PTA 
Board, ELAC, Sch
ool Site Council and District committees such as the District Advisory Committee, DELAC and Community 
Advisory Committee (CAC).
 
 
The Crescent PTA offers varied educational enhancements, not only through funding, but also by being actively involved 
on 
all levels.  The PTA supports the instructional program by providing funding and/or volunteers for various instructional 
support programs.  This year, PTA donated funding for supplemental classroom materials, technology, curricular 
enrichment programs such
 
as "Art Masters", TK through grade 4 Music, Mystery Science and academic competitions.  PTA 
has provided dedicated volunteers for our "Reflections" art contest, "I Know My States" geography competitions, in 
addition to a myriad of classroom volunteers.  T
he PTA also provides school connectedness events for students and their 
families throughout the year such as the Fall Festival, International Fair, Family Science Night and Career Day.  More 
information on parent involvement may be found on the PTA website
 
at http://www.crescentpta.org/.
 
 
The Crescent School Site Council, composed of staff and parents, reviews the instructional program and approves 
additional State funding for staff development and developmental educational materials.  The School Site Counc
il meets 
a minimum of six times a year and invites all interested parents to attend its meetings.  ELAC (English Learner Advisory 
Council) meets a minimum of 4 times a year and all parents of Limited English Proficient students are invited to attend.  
Pare
ntal involvement is an essential part in helping to educate our children at Crescent.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-

32289, a Comprehensive 
Safe School Plan particular to their site. Each school site is required annually, by March 1st, to have reviewed, and if 
neces
sary, updated their Safe School Plan. Each school forwards its Safe School Plan to the district through the office of 
Student and Community Services (SCS). The SCS office provides plan development assistance to the schools and maintains 
a file of individua
l school plans available for inspection by the public.
 
 
Our staff is committed to providing a safe and orderly learning environment.  Fire evacuation drills are held monthly and 
earthquake and lock
-
down drills are both conducted quarterly.  All schools in 
the district are linked through an emergency 
radio contact system, and district radio drills are held periodically to be prepared in case of an actual disaster.  Providin
g 
a safe environment for our students is of paramount concern at Crescent Elementary.
 
 
Crescent has a Site Safety Plan monitored by the School Site Council.  The plan is reviewed with the staff each Fall and 
periodically during the year as we implement our plan.  Our School Safety plan was updated and reviewed in February, 
2019. Our goals f
or the 2019
-
2020 school year include incorporating school wide character education programs, continue 
as a "bucket
-
filling" school to promote positive behavior and prevent bullying, communicate parking lot safety procedures 
to parents and staff, and replen
ish emergency supplies for all students.
 
 
School wide, classroom and bus rules are reinforced throughout the school by teachers, the principal, instructional 
assistants, noon duty supervisors, bus drivers and parent volunteers.  Bus, bike and walking safet
y procedures are 
addressed in age
-
appropriate class discussions and assemblies.  Parents are informed immediately through a strong home
-
school communication system if their child is involved in any inappropriate or unsafe behavior.  Appropriate student 
beh
avior is reinforced through our Restorative Practices, Peaceful Playground and positive reinforcement program.
