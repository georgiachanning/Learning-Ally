By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
School Facilities:
 
Lamont 
Elementary School is comprised of 36 regular classrooms, 2 reading lab rooms, 1 speech room, 1 PE room, and a 
library with two workstations.  We have two full
-
time and five part
-
time custodians to ensure a clean and safe 
environment, in which learning can 
take place. We take pride in the condition of our school.  Our efforts to maintain a 
school that is clean and attractive include: painting our school each year, removing graffiti immediately, teaching students 
to clean up after themselves, and mowing and t
rimming lawns weekly. The facility strongly supports teaching and learning 
through its ample classroom and playground space.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair:
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisor
s are 
proactive and conduct inspections at school sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good 
condition and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service 
and that emerg
ency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process & Schedule:
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. All schools are cleaned daily. A
 
summary of these standards is available at the school o
ffice or at the district office. The site administration team works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

Lamont School parents are 

members taek an active role in supporting Lamont School students and programs.  Parents help plan and evaluate 
programs and school improvements.  They elect parent
s and teachers elect teachers for the Lamont School Site Council 
and English Learners Advisory Committee. Parents may nominate themselves by completing a parent volunteer survey 
early in the school year. The School Site Council meets at 3:30  p.m. in room 
17. All meetings are open to the public.
 
 
Parents are invited to attend and participate different activities throughout the school year.  Two times a year parents are 
invited to have coffee with the principal in an informal setting that is parent oriented 
and in some cases led.  Meetings 
may have a specific theme that is addressed depending on the community and student needs but attendees are 
encouraged to discuss any concerns or ideas that may arise.  Parents are always encouraged to help in our classrooms
, 
with playground supervision, fundraising activities, and to chaperone other activities.
 
 
Parent education nights are tailored to assist parents in helping their students obtain academic success.  These meetings 
are offered at least three times during the
 
school year.  The meetings focus on core subjects such as reading and math as 
well as discipline and emergency guidelines and the end of the year assessments.  Through these meetings parents are 
provided with information on how to better assist their stud
ents at home.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
The Safe School Plan was updated August, 2019. It is a working document that is reviewed and updated as changes are 
needed. This year the School's Safety Committee, School Site Council, Local Law Enforcement and District and Site staff 
are worki
ng on revising the plan to ensure that it is SB 187 compliant. Once the plan has been reviewed and revised, we 
present it to the staff during a staff meeting so they know their roles and responsibilities during different emergency 
situations. 
 
 
In working 
to keep our schools safe, we employ the following procedures:
 

 
We follow the plan approved by District Board of Trustees.
 

 
The school is fenced with all entry gates locked during school hours (or the time while students are on campus)
 

 
Classroom doors are 
always locked and closed.
 

 
Six staff members supervise students during morning and lunch recess.
 

 
All visitors must check in at the front office using the Raptor System and wear a visitor's pass.
 

 
During regular school hours parents must check out their child
 
through the front office and complete a student 
release slip before picking up their child from their classroom.
 

 
Teachers instruct and demonstrate safety to their students;
 

 
The school holds at least one of each of the following drills each month: Intruder
 
on campus, fire and 
earthquake drills monthly and a bus evacuation drill (per year).
 

 
The Emergency procedures are reviewed with staff tri
-
annually and as necessary during staff meetings.
 

 
Yearly CPR training is provided by the school and/or district nurse 
to all staff.
 

 
Office staff and principal get a CPR re
-
fresher every year and are re
-
certified in accordance to guidelines.
 
Our custodial/maintenance staff maintain a safe and clean campus. They conduct regular maintenance and repairs and 
remove graffiti as
 
soon as it is found. They also clean classrooms and restrooms on a daily basis and clean all spills as well 
as maintain facilities stocked with the necessary daily supplies.

Staff Development:
 
 
The district provides opportunities for professional development throughout the school year.  Lamont School teachers 
were provided with grade level planning as needed to prepare for the 
transition to Common Core State Standards. The 
principal and the academic coach also attended professional development training to enhance teaching strategies within 
the new common core standards. The academic coach hosted Close Reading training for all gr
ade levels and hosted a 
training defining the shifts for both language arts and math. The district offered three staff development days in July, 
October, and January of the current school year. These staff development days can go for a full day covering su
bjects from 
ELD instruction to reading, writing and math strategies for all levels of instruction. Throughout the year, teachers are 
encouraged to attend workshops addressing areas such as math and reading strategies, special education, and GATE. This 
is s
upported by our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA). Our para
-
professionals are also encouraged to attend 
workshops or in
-
services that they feel will provide them with additional support and strategies. The district has provided 
training for the ne
wly adopted language arts and math curriculum and will be providing planning days throughout the 
year. Approximately 90% of our Lamont School Certificated staff attended the Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading 
and Spelling (LETRS) and Numbers Train
ing during the 17
-
18 school year. It is our plan to make sure the remaining teachers 
receive the same training for the 18
-
19 school year.
 
 
Structured teacher planning time is held bi
-
monthly to analyze data, plan instruction, monitor student progress and 
ev
aluate program effectiveness in teaching the Language Arts, ELD, and Mathematics standards. Teachers were provided 
with professional development for the Journey's new adoption for language arts. They are provided training for 
professional learning communit
ies, mathematics support from district academic coaches, as well as other opportunities 
to refine their craft.
 
 
The district continues to promote Professional Learning Communities allowing staff to work together, collaborate, and 
support each other as they
 
review data, student achievement, and research based strategies.   English Language 
Development has been a primary focus for both the district and site as well as professional development in math and 
reading foundational skills.
