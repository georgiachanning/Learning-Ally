School Description
 
Welcome to Palmquist Elementary!
 
 
Our hope is that you and your child will find our school to be joyful and welcoming. As school is a 

incredible staff will ensure that your child has an amazing school y
ear by engaging them in hands 
on learning experiences, which will tap into their innate curiosity and support your child in making 
connections between the concepts and skills they are learning in the classroom, and how it 
connects to the real world applica
tions.   We are an Inquiry Based Learning School, with an 
emphasis on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) education.  Our goal is for your 
child is to develop the habits of a life long learner and to feel excited about coming to our school
 
each day!
 
 
Some of the learning opportunities available for students center around our vision for learning, 
where "Our students students to be innovative critical thinkers who: ask and answer complex 
questions, investigate real world problems, and design 
solutions to challenges based on their 
understanding and application of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)."  Education 
at Palmquist Elementary is child
-
centered and focuses on teaming with parents and community 
members to prepare all studen
ts to be competent, responsible, and contributing members of 

innate curiosity and encourages the joy of discovery.  Our skilled staff members provide a r
igorous 
academic program that emphasizes the application of an inquiry
-
based learning model. Students 
become motivated, engaged learners ready to face the challenges of the 21st century.through the 
instruction of creativity, communication, collaboration, a
nd critical thinking,
 
 
In 2011 the Oceanside Unified Board of Education designated Palmquist Elementary as a STEM 
school.  To advance the instruction of science, technology, engineering, and math, Palmquist has 
implemented the inquiry
-
based learning curric
ulum: Project Lead the Way.  The curriculum 
integrates Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards.  Our hands
-
on 
life science, media production studio and maker space labs, as well as our greenhouse and garden 
offer students the oppo
rtunity to apply skills learned during core instruction to real
-
world 
problems.  The introduction of 1:1 iPads in grades 3
-
5 and 2:1 in grades K
-
2 has enhanced student 
use of technology as a tool for creation not just consumption. In addition this year, Pa
lmquist offers 
Inquiry Labs in which students use the inquiry model to explore areas of interest to them. For 
example this year, we are offering collage art, music production/appreciation, Global Citizenship, 
Drama, product engineering and design,  high te
ch farming, sensors in the green house, and 
creative writing during the school day in grades 3 

 
5.
 
 
For over five years Palmquist has offered the largest after school program in the district. Palmquist 
Roadrunner Enrichment Program (PREP) offers over 20 c
lasses. For more information about this 
PTO sponsored program, visit the school website.  Palmquist was the first district school to become 
a Zero Waste School. Presently, we are working on the development of an organic and a hydroponic 
farm.  The farm's p
roduce is used in the school cafeteria as part of a partnership with the school 
district Farm to School Program.  Starting in 2016, Palmquist will begin a student
-
developed 
Community Sponsored Agriculture program. We welcome all visitors and community memb
ers who 
are interested in learning more about Palmquist to tour the school.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities);

-
wide expectations that promote respect, responsibility, and safety.  The 8

conducive to student advancement in both social and academic areas. Counseling services are available to assist students with
 
social and behavioral

Our teachers take time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. T
he district provides 
professional learning on English Language Arts and English Language development, and supports the teachers in 
developing expertise in our newly 
adopted ELA program. Staff members are encouraged to participate in their specific areas of interest. With the addition of ne
w science and engineering 
curriculum and iPads/Chromebooks in the classrooms, on
-
site training is
 
being provided twice monthly to meet the specific needs of our students and 
teachers. Our vertical teams of teachers meet monthly to determine areas of need for professional learning.  These teams are 
the facilitators and or 
presenters.  The professional 
learnings occur the first week teachers return to school. and the first and third Wednesdays after school. This year, we are 
using personalized professional development (ed camp style) opportunity where teachers are given time to improve their skills
 
in th
eir areas of interest, 
specifically as it relates to  literacy, mathematics, restorative practices and inquiry
-
based instruction. Teachers are supported by discussing the 
professional learning at staff meetings and during PLC time.  Each year, we have offe
red at least 17 days of on
-
going professional learning time to our 
staff.
