School Description
 
Del Rio's focus is on ensuring that all students have opportunities to engage in rigorous tasks that 
require them to think critically and that they are able to demonstrate deep learning in meaningful 
ways both verbally and in writing. We are working toward
s becoming a school full of opportunities 
for all students to discover their strengths and passions. We are also working towards teaching the 
whole child including everything from healthy lifestyle choices (through our American Heart 
Association 3 week Hea
lthy Heart Challenge; the Single Marine PE Fitness Challenge Day; Gardening 
and Nutrition education through FoodCorps; and Recycling Awareness.
 
 
This year, we are also focusing on meeting students' academic needs by offering intensive 
intervention (tutoring) from the teachers of roster during art enrichment so all students have access 
to visual arts while ensuring all needs are met at their individual levels.
 
 
In addition to academic supports, parent and community involvement helps our 
students in a 
multitude of essential ways. Our PTO sponsors programs and draws on the special interests and 
abilities of parents. It coordinates fundraisers and provides financial support for our programs. To 
further parent and community involvement, we ho
st monthly Coffee Chats with the principal and 
send weekly phone/email messages home to families to keep everyone in the loop. We have found 
success with our focused community
-
wide effort by creating an academically rigorous and positive 
learning environme
nt that nurtures the whole child.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summ
ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

C. Engagement
 
 
State 
Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each scho
ol site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The School Site Council (SSC) meets monthly to set priorities and make decisions about budget expenditures. The English Langu
age Advisory Committee 
(ELAC) meets at least four times throu
ghout the school year and advises the School Site Council on issues regarding English learners. We have an active 
PTO, which coordinates fund
-
raisers and volunteer opportunities. Del Rio also hosts a series of enrichment nights for families in the areas of
 
literacy, 
math, science, and the arts. Grade level Shadow
-
a
-
Student days provide opportunities for parents to spend a day shadowing their child at Del Rio. We 
very much appreciate our parent volunteers who make possible many of the activities and programs
 
we offer our students. Please see our Parent 
Involvement Policy available on the Del Rio website for a complete listing of involvement opportunities.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
P
upil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Annual surveys indicate that both Del Rio students and their parents feel that our campus is safe and secure. This year we ad
ded the clos
ed campus 
security aspect by locking the gates and asking all visitors to check in at the front office. Parents have been receptive to 
this idea and appreciate us 
ensuring student safety. Playground supervisors monitor students before school and during mor
ning and lunch recesses. We added another supervisor 
to the staff so students have more options across playgrounds. We have a closed campus that is fully fenced. All visitors mus
t enter the school through 
the main office, sign in, and receive a badge to we
ar throughout their stay. Emergency and fire drills are held every month. The Crisis Preparedness Plan 
is updated and reviewed with faculty annually. Its effectiveness is analyzed on an ongoing basis and procedural modifications
 
are made as needed. The 
Cri
sis Preparedness Plan is available for review in the school office.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Del Rio's professional development focus has been based on the Oceanside Unified School District's Instructional Focus: "All 
students will demonstrate 
their thinking, both verbally and in writing, to show understanding of their learning." Professional deve
lopment activities occur the first and third 
Wednesdays of the month during Professional Learning Community meetings. In addition, teachers are provided with four release
 
time to collaborate 
and plan together. This year we are doing Lesson Studies with all
 
K
-
5 teachers for professional development. The first and third Wednesdays of every 
month are also designated for professional development training, collaboration and data analysis. Individual teachers and gra
de level teams meet 
regularly with the Principa
l to discuss best practices and to ensure student progress. District opportunities support flexibility in the topics educator
s 
choose to explore deeply. Teachers also have an opportunity for a roving sub to cover their class while they observe a collea
gue 
during instructional time 
to expand their teaching strategies repertoire.
