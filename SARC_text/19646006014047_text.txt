By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or
 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
pr
incipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

e LiveWell Kids curriculum. Throughout the school 
year, students are exposed to a variety of enrichment opportunities through music, STEAM, mindfulness, 
garden/nutrition, physical education and blended learning opportunities.  The high level of involvement
 
of our parents

Beach.
 
 
The commitment to high levels of academic achievement were seen in 2019, from the data received from the Cal
ifornia

October 2019
 
 
Hermosa Beach City  School District sets a high 
priority upon ensuring that high quality, standards

most promising programs are piloted using established criteria and guidelines. The recommended books are 
then 
approved by the Hermosa Beach City School District Board of Education. To receive State instructional funds, the Hermosa 
Beach City School District ensures that it has fully complied with the requirements of Education Code Section 60119. The 
District 
has also conducted an annual public hearing ensuring the sufficiency of instructional materials. Each school

students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the re
quirements for entrance to

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
High parental involvement and 
participation is a unique characteristic of the Hermosa Beach City School District. The two 
schools within the district: Hermosa Valley and Hermosa View are supported by the same organizations. The Hermosa 
Valley/View Parent Teacher Organization (HVPTO), t
he Hermosa Beach Education Foundation (HBEF) contribute a 
significant amount of fund
-
raising revenue providing supplementary educational materials and programs for the district.  
Parents also actively participate in decision making and goal setting through
 
School Site Council (SSC) and the LCAP 
Advisory Committee.  All parents and community members are welcome to attend any school meeting or activity.
 
 
To strengthen parent involvement, various opportunities are provided throughout the year. These activities
 
include parent 
education workshops, flag ceremonies, HVPTO Halloween Carnival, Dolphin Dash and Books Before Bedtime. Parents are 
also always welcome to volunteer in the classroom. For more information about organized opportunities for parent 
involvement 
at Hermosa View, please contact the school office.
