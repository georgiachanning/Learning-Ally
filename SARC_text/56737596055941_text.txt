By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

SCHOOL DESCRIPTION
 
Glenwood Elementary School is one of seventeen elementary schools in the Conejo Valley Unified School District. Opening 

d socioeconomic diversity. Goals are reflected in 
the School Plan for Student Achievement and demonstrate support for all students in reading, writing, math, and student 
connections for all subgroups. Student data is gathered and monitored regularly in sch
eduled data team meetings as 
teachers meet to designate enrichment and intervention groups in the areas of Language Arts and Math throughout the 
school year. The staff uses data from trimester progress reports, report cards, grade level and trimester Bench
mark 
assessments, and classroom assessments to monitor student progress and plan intervention and instruction groups. 
Glenwood students have a 30 minute dedicated time period four days a week using credentialed academic specialists for 
focused instruction 
in language arts and math called Target Time. Target Time allows credentialed staff to develop small 
group targeted instruction to focus on targeted skills. Four Target Time sessions during the year strategically place 
students into groups for targeted ins
truction for Language Arts and/or math. Glenwood's E
-
Block provides English 
Language Learners with daily instructional time for the development of English skills with district
-
adopted curriculum. 
Teachers use information from ELPAC, classroom assessments a
nd IPT to work on English skills with the designated EL 
students. Glenwood hosts an after school program with the ASES Grant with STAR Inc. that serves 80 students each school 
day providing tutorial, homework, and supplemental activities in the fine arts a
nd science until 6:00 p.m. A local 
community church provides free weekly tutoring services for the students on their site two day a week for students in 
grades 1
-
3. After the Winter Holidays, after school enrichment classes are offered for sewing and paper
 
crafting.

Starting in the fall of 2018, Glenwood implemented a new Global Studies focus school wide called "Spotlight on OUR 
World." Throughout the year, time is dedicated each Monday for teachers and students to explore our world. There are 
seven sessio
ns during the year. Each session has a dedicated continent to study. During this time, each grade level has 
selected a region our country in the Continent as the grade level focus. Students explore this country/region over a three
-
week period with a focus 
on literature, art and other topics. Students earn stickers for their passport and upon leaving the 
5th grade, they will have explored over 42 locations. In addition, students receive weekly instruction in Spanish, French, 
Chinese an American Sign Language
; we teach all the students common words such as please, thank you, family, etc. 
Glenwood is supported by two Thousand Oaks High School science teachers who are working with the staff to bring NGSS 
to the elementary school through Spotlight.
 
 
We are fortun
ate to be able to support our students with a part time bilingual counselor, a part
-
time bilingual Social 
Worker, and a part
-
time bilingual Parent Outreach Coordinator position. They work to support our students and 
coordinate our parent education meetings
. They bring resources to assist any at
-
risk families and guide them to the many 
community resources available. In addition, we are grateful for the support of four bilingual paraprofessionals who work 
on our campus daily providing translation services and
 
support in classrooms.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
January 2020
 
 
All TK
-
12 students have current standards
-
based textbooks in math, 
science, history/social science, and English/language 
arts. With each curricular cycle established by the State of California, the Conejo Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) 
Board of Education adopts textbooks within the timeline provided. Standards
-
ali
gned books for grades 9
-
12 are approved 
locally. Textbooks in grades K
-
8 are selected from lists of books and materials approved by the State Board of Education. 
Sufficient standards
-
based textbooks and instructional materials have been purchased for all s
tudents in English, math, 
history/social science, science, health and foreign language. In addition, annually, sites receive specific science 
supplementary funds to be used for consumable laboratory expenses and/or equipment.
 
 
The process of selecting text
books and materials involves the formation of a committee charged with the responsibility of 
reviewing current state standards and frameworks, analyzing student data, writing courses of study (as required) and 
selecting and maintaining current instructiona
l materials. The goal of such district
-
wide committees comprised of teachers 
and administrators representing all targeted grade levels, is to achieve high academic standards for all of our TK
-
12 
students. Each major subject area, such as math, science, his
tory/social science, foreign language and English/language 
arts, is reviewed and adopted under the guidance of the California Department of Education and State Board of Education. 
The committee submits its recommendations to the Board of Education for fina
l approval. The recommendation to the 
Board includes the basic textbook materials as well as supplementary materials within the subject. On October 1, 2019, 
the CVUSD Board of Education approved a resolution for the 2019
-
2020 school year declaring that the
 
Conejo Valley 
Unified School District has provided each pupil with sufficient standards
-
based textbooks and instructional materials 
consistent with the cycles and content of the curriculum frameworks.

Each fall, a team that consists of all or many of the following personnel, inspects each school in the Conejo Valley Unified 
School District:  Site Administrator, Director of Maintenance and Operations, Director of Planning and New Construction, 
and the As
sistant Superintendent.  A facilities evaluation is completed documenting the condition of the school in a variety 
of areas including the cleanliness of restrooms, condition of roofs, paving and walkways, HVAC systems, landscape 
maintenance, etc.  Any obse
rved condition that represents a threat to the health and safety of students and staff is 
annotated for immediate correction.  Notes include items that could improve the utility, appearance, sustainable 
maintenance, or safety of the school and are recorded

time custodians at Glenwood Elementary and they follow District
-
defined cleaning standards 
and schedules to ensure that the school provides our stu
dents and staff with clean, healthy, and attractive learning 
environments. Glenwood Elementary was opened in 1963.  Sited on 10.01 acres of land, the school had 27 classrooms, a 
multipurpose room, a library, and an administration building until 2010 when t
he site was expanded and the campus 
divided to accommodate Bridges, a new Charter school.  The campus underwent modernization in 2000, replacing and 
upgrading underground utilities, restrooms, doors, and improving accessibility under ADA.  The current capa
city at 
Glenwood is 510 students.  The District Site Inspection Team assessed the school on December 26, 2019.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Ass
essment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA]
 
and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standa
rds [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University
, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
