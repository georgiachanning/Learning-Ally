Dear Parents and 
Community Members,
 
 
The Washington Middle School mission is to prepare all students for 21st century college and 
careers. We are continuously implementing 21st century technology to enhance learning within all 
content areas. We model and require all studen
ts to demonstrate behavior that is ready, 
responsible, and respectful. Through a united collaboration of staff, parents, and the community, 
we are fostering strong foundations that empower our students to become responsible and 
productive citizens. We are 
empowering students to be creative thinkers and problem solvers.
 
 
We are proud to offer a comprehensive Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM) 
program on our campus, including five sections of STEM
-
based Project Lead The
 
Way (PLTW).  Our 
PLTW program offers classes in Electrical Engineering, Design and Modeling, Automation and Vex 
Robotics, and Introduction to Computer Science. We are proud to offer an elective class in Model 
United Nations which will allow students an op
portunity to learn global perspectives and 
collaborate with neighboring Middle Schools. Washington also offers elective classes in technology, 
AVID, PALs, ASB, Art, Band, Choir, and Theater.
 
 
Students in all grades utilize a personalized Apple iPad during 
all classes to enhance learning. This 
year, every student will bring their iPad to and from school to continue learning through technology 
during after school hours. Read 180, System 44, and NewsELA programs integrate state
-
of
-
the art 
technology to ensure 
proficiency in Language Arts for all our students.
 
 
During the 2019
-
20 academic school year we will continue our Positive Behavior Interventions and 
Support (PBIS) program in addition to an emphasis on Social Emotional Learning (SEL) for both 
students and 
adults.  These emphases promote positive interactions and work to improve the 
culture and climate across campus. At the home of the Patriots both academic excellence and 
creating socially well
-
rounded and involved students are of the utmost importance.
 
 
We
 
offer a wide collection of highly engaging after school programs, such as homework assistance, 
co
-
ed sports, Italian, student clubs, Art, math tutorials, computers, Model United Nations, 
Femineers, and Boys and Girls Club (an After School Education and Sa
fety program).
 
 
Our staff continues to work in the Professional Learning Community (PLC) model, which is research
-
based and supports highly effective teaching strategies. This year our focus is to continue to 
implement research
-
based instructional strategi
es that incorporate critical thinking, creativity, 
collaboration, and communication among students. Mastering these skills will ensure that all 
Patriots are prepared for future educational and career endeavors.
 
 
We look forward to collaborating with all ou
r parents and other community members to ensure 
the most successful year possible.
 
 
Respectfully,
 
 
Ed Resnick Ph.D                                Elizabeth Maldonado

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement 
(Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate 
Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement st
andards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

School 
Safety Plan
 
Washington Middle School has collaborated with district officials and 
School Resource Officer Nathaniel Garcia from the La Habra Police 
Department to design a comprehensive Site Safety Plan, which was 
approved by the School Site Council and rev
iewed with staff annually. The 
goals for the Safety Plan are:
 

 
We are pleased to announce that we have added gates with 
safety push out hardware all around campus for student 
safety and campus security.
 

 
Provide all students and staff members with a safe tea
ching 
and learning environment.
 

 
Keep all students safe and secure at school, traveling to and 
from school, and at school
-
related activities.
 

 
Provide district programs and community resources to 
students and parents.
 

 
Washington Middle School provides an edu
cational 
environment where students, parents, staff, and community 
members participate respectfully without regard to race, 
culture, or religious background.
 

 
Staff and administration monitor the campus from 7:40 a.m. 
to 4:00 p.m. Our campus is closed, with
 
clearly posted and 
communicated rules for visitors. All guests are to report to 
the office and get a visitor

s pass if entering the campus. All 
staff are instructed to report any unauthorized individuals 
immediately.
 

 
Emergency drills are practiced monthly
 
to ensure student 
safety in the event of an emergency. All rooms have clearly 
posted emergency evacuation maps for students and staff to 
follow.
 

 
We also have a School Resource Officer (SRO) on campus 
during the school day to provide additional support to 
students and staff and to provide assistance in the event of 
an emergency.

Each year the District looks at student achievement data along with teacher requests for 
specific trainings to determine the plan for the four Districtwide 
professional development days.  In 2017
-
2018, training focused on new English Language Arts adoptions, Wonders and Amplify.  In 2018
-
2019 training 
focused on new Mathematics adoptions, Brid
ges and Math Links.  In 2019
-
2020, training focused on developing Multi
-
Tiered System of Supports (MTSS).
 
 
In addition to the Districtwide trainings, each site works with a consultant from InnovateEd to develop Cycles of Inquiry aro
und their strategic focu
s.  
Teacher leaders attend seven days of training to analyze student data, develop a strategic focus for the year, implement evid
ence based lessons, and 
analyze student work.  Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSAs) assigned to each site work with all teach
ers throughout the year during the school day 
and during PLC time to support implementation of the strategic focus.

s calculated by taking the total 
number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students w
ho met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated 
in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of 
students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number 
of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentage
s are calculated using only students who received scores.

Washington Middle School recognizes how crucial parent involvement is to student success. A successful
 
school is one in which parents are active 
members of the school community. We strongly encourage parents to get involved and participate in all Washington Middle Schoo
l activities.
 
 
We have many ways for parents to participate in the life of our school an
d we depend on parents to keep many of our programs running smoothly. Some 
of the activities designed to increase parent involvement include: PTSA, English Language Advisory Committee, Parent Advisory
 
and Information Team, 
School Site Council, Family Night
s, Student

activities. In addition, many opportunities are available for parents to volunteer at school, either in classrooms, in the li
brary, as an assist
ant for a group 
of teachers, helping to supervise field trips, or through the PTSA and the activities they sponsor.  In addition we offer a P
arent Institute of Quality 
Education (PIQE) program, in which parents are able to participate in educational course
s designed to support the academic achievement of their child.
