the only secondary 
school in Santa Barbara County to receive this award! Our School Accountability Report Card (SARC) 
is a document designed to provide annual information to t
he community, parents, and staff on 
topics specified by the California Department of Education. This document is one measure of school 

and outlines how we 
will meet those expectations at our school sites. 
 
 
At the beginning of each school year, administrators and staff within Buellton Union School District 
establish goals and objectives to increase the success of its students and staff. For the 2019
-
2020 
sch
ool year, our goals include: 
 
 
Provide focused, standards
-
based instruction to all students in all core subject areas. 
 
 
Provide targeted interventions to students who are under
-
performing in math. 
 
 
Provide a stronger focus on reading and language arts in
struction by implementing a 90 minute 
English block class.
 
 
Provide a seven period instructional day for grades 6 through 8.
 
 
Provide a tutorial period for students in need of extra supports.
 
 
Provide enrichment classes for students such as art, music, and
 
photography.
 
 
Provide access to the core curriculum in a variety of hands
-
on and traditional instructional settings. 
 
 

 
 
Pilot new science curriculum and adopt new science curriculum in March of 2020.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abo
ut the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal
 
or the 
district office.

Buellton Union School District held a public hearing on September 11, 2
014, and determined that each school within the district had sufficient and good 
quality textbooks, instructional materials, and science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. The State of
 
California. All students, 
including English  lear
ners, are given their own individual Standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional  materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the 
classroom and to take home. Textbooks are adopted by the Board of Trustees after review by teachers and parents according
 
to the timeline established 
by the State of California.
 
 
All district textbooks are State Board adopted  and aligned to the Academic Content Standards established by the California B
oard of Education. During 
the 2014
-
15 school year, Buellton Union School 
District adopted College Preparatory Mathematics (CPM), 2013, for Mathematics. The texts were 
implemented during the 2014

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Jonata Middle School. The 
school complies with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to 

nt and staff safety during 
a disaster. Fire, disaster, earthqua
ke and lockdown drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year. Our annual district
-
wide disaster 
drill simulation helps our safety teams stay current with best practice. Additionally, lead teachers are CPI
-
trained in Crisis Prevention 
and Intervention. 
We also use Parent Square for school and district
-
wide emergency communications.
 
 
To ensure student safety, teachers and instructional aides supervise students at all times before, during, and after school. 
Our full
-
time district counselo
r 
provides social
-
emotional support for students as needed. All visitors are required to check in at the school office upon arrival, submit the
ir drivers license 

e on campus, and check out at the office upon leaving. 
Parents and community are updated every fall as to the secure campus procedures, including locked gates during school hours, 
and direct drop
-
off and 
pick
-
up.
 
 
The Comprehensive Safety Plan was 
developed by the school in consultation with local law enforcement in order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997. 
The plan provides students and staff a means to ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. Components of the Comprehensi
ve Safety Plan 
include 
the following: child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response proced
ures, procedures for safe 
drop
-
off and pickup from school, sexual harassment policy, and dress code policy. Jonata Middle r
eviews the plan annually in and updates it as needed.  
A copy of the safety plan is available to the public at the school office.
 
 
The School Safety Plan was last reviewed and updated in February, 2019.

Strategic Professional Development provides each teacher with a variety of professional growth opportunities as site and dist
rict leads in curriculum, 
teaching strategies and methodologies, 
technology and assessment.
 
 
All new teachers are supported by the Santa Barbara County Teacher Induction Program, formerly "BTSA" the state
-
sponsored Beginning Teacher Support 
and Assessment Program. Participating new teachers are provided with support fro
m the district, the Santa Barbara County Office of Education, and 
monthly seminars. All teachers participate in two full professional development days, one on site and one held in the Santa I
nez Valley for "Valley
-
wide 
Professional Development." Throughout
 
the year teachers meet and collaborate in Professional Learning Communities (PLC's) on early release Mondays. 
In addition, teachers attend workshops on various topics related to the implementation plan for LCAP and the Common Core Stan
dards as well as mee
t 
with grade level colleagues within the valley. The district Technology Committee continues to drive the district's use of bes
t practices in technology 
integration in the classroom.
 
 
The implementation of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the M
ulti
-
Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) will be developed at each school site. 
The district continues to join with other valley school districts to provide a comprehensive year
-
long professional development program with consultation 
from the County Office fo
r all teachers in instructional strategies for the implementation of the Common Core Standards in English Language Arts and 
Math and technology. In Oct., 2019, all teachers in the Buellton Union School District attended a full
-
day professional developing o
n students' mental 
health and social & emotional development and well
-
being.
 
 
Staff development is based on the needs of the students and the changing demands of instruction. In the 2016
-
2017 school year, the focus was 
mathematics training to support Engli
sh Learners and facilitating the transition to the Common Core State Standards using the new adoption of College 
Preparatory Math (CPM). Teachers attended trainings to support our Gold Ribbon Award winning math intervention program. Our a
nnual staff 
develo
pment day(s) and All
-
Valley Collaboration Days provided teachers with additional support in mathematics  and literacy teaching strategies and 
methodologies with regard to the Common Core State Standards. Additionally, teachers have attended workshops on NG
SS and technology in the 
classroom.
 
 
All core subject teachers teachers meet in PLC groups  for one day in the fall and one full day in the spring to plan and mak
e pacing plans aligned with 
Common Core State Standards as well as to look at data to plan fur
ther instruction.  Math teachers also attend the CPM conference for 2 days to learn 
about math RtI and various math strategies. Math teachers also used 1.5 PD days during the summer of 2016 to learn about Drea
mbox, Number Talks, 
and other components for th
e math Success intervention classes.  ELA teachers attended a Reading Plus PD in the Spring of 2016.
 
 
Teachers who require help with improving skills are given as much support as needed to ensure their continued professional de
velopment.
