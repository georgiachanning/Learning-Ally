School Description:
 
 
The Proctor Elementary School Community is 
dedicated to providing active learning in a clean, safe, 
and supportive environment.
 

 
We recognize mastery of academic skills as a primary goal.
 

 
We strive to create and maintain an atmosphere that fosters the healthy emotional, 
intellectual, social, and phy
sical growth of each student.
 

 
We value education as a process of opening our students' minds to critical thought and 
creative activity.
 

 
We believe in the development of curriculum that encourages consideration for others, 
appreciation for diversity, compas
sion, empathy, responsibility, and self
-
discipline.
 

 
We provide a curriculum that adapts to all learning styles and unique abilities.
 

 
We incorporate the use of appropriate technologies to expand learning opportunities 
for students and to increase their rate
 
of success.
 

 
We foster an understanding of traditions and contemporary issues.
 

 
We emphasize that learning extends beyond the classroom walls and is a life
-
long 
experience.
 

 
We promote a partnership between home, school, and community.
 

 
We acknowledge that le
arning is enhanced in an environment of sharing, caring, 
laughing, questioning, risking, and growing.
 
Proctor Elementary School one of nine elementary schools in the suburban community of Castro 
Valley, a beautiful community of rolling hills and canyons wi
th mild winters and pleasant summers. 
Across the bay from San Francisco and just south of the city of Oakland, Castro Valley is a growing 
and a richly diverse community with neighborly appeal.
 
 
Our Proctor parents and the wider community are key 
partners in our commitment to provide 
excellent educational programs. That spirit of teamwork has allowed Proctor to purchase and install 
technology, purchase supplemental instructional materials to enrich the curriculum, beautify the 
school grounds, and e
stablish a school garden to extend the regular curriculum to include 
environmental studies.
 
 
Proctor Elementary uses a Multi
-
Tiered System Approach (MTSS) to support the learning of all 
students, as we focus on the "whole child." Tiered academic and behavi
or interventions have been 
developed to support student success in and out of the classroom. We are especially proud of 
Proctor's science lab, created by the hard work and continued support of our district and parent 
community. It is fully equipped with co
nsumable materials that a true science classroom uses, 
giving students a hands
-
on lab experience implementing the New Generation Science Standards 
(NGSS). Our school library has a large collection of culturally diverse materials, all selected to 
support an
d extend the K
-
5 common core curriculum, and culturally responsive teaching. The 
collection includes books, periodicals, DVDs, audio materials, with Chromebook access for students 
to have multiple research opportunities and access. To support 21st Century 
learning, Kinder 
classrooms have 20 ipads per class for student use, and 1st 
-
 
5th grade classes have one to one 
Chromebook access in their classrooms. As developmentally appropriate, students are taught to 
use Google Apps, typing, word processing, the web
 
for project based assignments, assessments, 
and participate in programs that support RTI.

During non
-
school hours, we share our facility with such youth groups as Youth to Youth, science of robotics. the sports leagues, and sc
out 
groups. Our sports field
 
is maintained by the Hayward Area Recreational Department, in collaboration with the CVUSD. Our Parent 
Beautification Committee, PTA, and other community organizations have raised funds, and applied multiple grants towards creat
ing a 
new outdoor classroom
, and school garden. Our custodial staff, with district support, also take pride in maintaining a campus befitting of 
the high standards of the Proctor community.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Proctor Elementary School opened in 1955 in a quiet residential area at the top of Redwood Road. The campus covers more than 
14 acres. In the first 
phase of construction, the campus included an office building, cafet
eria, Kindergarten, regular classrooms, and restrooms. Additional construction in 
1964 added more classrooms, a library, science labs, and restrooms. In 1991, another wing was added to house five more classr
ooms. Electrical upgrades 
were made to accommodat
e our new technology equipment. Four more classrooms were built in 1996 and 1997 to accommodate enrollment changes 
resulting from class size reduction. In 2000, updated playground equipment was installed on both the upper and lower playgrou
nds and in the 
K
indergarten play yard offering students a variety of activity for play and skill development. A complete modernization of Pro
ctor's permanent buildings 
took place during the summer of 2005. Also during 2005, the Art Center was completed. In 2016, voters ap
proved Measure G which will bring many 
improvements to the campus. District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good working 
order are completed in 
a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure that service 
is efficient and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
The Hayward Area Recreation Department and other local youth athletic organizations utilize the playing fields for many eveni
ng and weekend activities 
and work with Proctor Elementary
 
School and the Castro Valley Unified School District to maintain the facilities.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: 
Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
O
pportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parent/guardian involvement is one of the great strengths of the Proctor school community. Parents/guardians feel comfortable
 
and welcomed at Proctor 
as regular volunteers, as visitors, and as par
ticipants and guests at school and parent group events. Parents/guardians and all staff members work closely 
in an effort to meet the needs of Proctor students. More than eight thousand hours are logged each year by parent volunteers 
in classrooms, the lib
rary, 
the science laboratory, and the school Art Center. Many more hours are volunteered supporting other Proctor programs. Parents
/guardians who cannot 
be on campus during the school day support Proctor through their organization of and participation in s
pecial events and programs (carnival, BBQ, book 
fair, Battle of the Books, LEAP Sandcastle program, FAME, walk
-
a
-
thon etc.). Parents/guardians participate in regularly scheduled school
-
sponsored 
activities, such as Back
-
to
-
School Night and Open House, and 
in PTA
-
sponsored activities, such as PTA meetings, the monthly Principal's Coffee, Science 
Night, and Family Education Nights such as Family Math Night and PTA's School Smarts program. Substantial financial support f
or student learning comes 
from parents a
nd the community through school
-
wide fundraising, the Science and Technology Booster Club, the Box Tops program and a PTA direct 
donation campaign at the start of the school year. Parents and family members are actively involved in the education of their
 
c
hildren and they participate 
eagerly in the numerous decision
-

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension 
rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Proctor School has a long history of disaster preparedness and safety training. A Proctor Safety Plan was formalized, with go
als and objectives to attain
. 
It is annually reviewed and updated by the School Site Council and the School Safety Committee. The Plan is on file at the Di
strict Office and the Alameda 

ke, and securing the campus, is on
-
going. Proctor's 
PTA receives funding annually to update emergency supplies from parent donations.  District funds are also provided to the si
te for safety 
preparedness/supplies.
 
 
A safe and orderly school climate is prom
oted. Parents, students, staff, and law enforcement are apprised of suspension and crime data and discuss their 
concerns. Our standards and consequences for student behavior are clearly communicated in the Student/Parent Handbook, throug
h school
-
wide 
assem
blies, and in class meetings. Student supervision is provided before and after school with campus monitors and the administra
tor supervising 
students during lunch. Walkie
-

curriculum aim to reduce impulsive 
and aggressive behaviors and increase protective factors and social
-
emotional competence. Organized by grade level, the program teaches children 
empathy, problem
-
solving skills, risk assessment, decision
-
making, and goal
-
setting skills. The Second Step program is classified as a universal 
intervention, meaning that it is appropriate for whole classrooms of children and not just those at risk.  Upper grade classr
ooms have developed a student 
leadership team called the Posit
ive Patriots to promote positive, responsible student behavior. Proctor supports student behavior through a multi
-
tiered 
system of support and through the Positive Behavior Intervention System (PBIS) and implemented SWIS in the Spring of 2017. Th
e cross
-
gr

contribute to the positive climate on campus. Teachers and the principal have built a strong home
-
to
-
school connection with parents that enable them 
to enlist immediate, consistent support for appropriate student behavior. All visitors and vo
lunteers are required to check in at the office and are required 
to wear an identification badge while on campus. The school staff and the larger community work together effectively to offer
 
a challenging, exciting, 
positive and safe educational environmen
t.
 
 
A cooperative effort between students, staff, and parents helps to maintain a clean campus. The Hayward Area Recreation Depar
tment utilizes the 
playing fields for many evening and weekend activities and work with the school district to maintain the fac
ilities.
