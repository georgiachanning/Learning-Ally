School Description
 
Mendota Elementary is one of six schools in the Mendota Unified School District, a rural area 
located 40 miles west of Fresno.  Student enrollment for the 2019
-
20120 school year totaled 807 
students comprised of students in TK through sixth grade.  The stu
dent population is made up of 
approximately 96% Hispanic students and 4% other.  Poverty is apparent in the agricultural
-
based 
community, where approximately 99.75% of the students qualify for the Free or Reduced Lunch 
Program.  The English learner populat
ion makes up 61.55% of the total student population.  Migrant 
students make up 11% of the total student population.  Mendota Elementary operates as a school 
wide Title 1 school.
 
The staff at Mendota Elementary is dedicated to providing the best educational
 
experience 
possible.  Academic skills and Positive Behavior and Supports are taught and emphasized.  Every 
classroom is equipped with wireless internet access, one to one Chromebooks for students, SMART 
Wall Technology, which includes a SMART interactive 
board, a document camera, an infrared sound 
system and microphone. Students at Mendota Elementary have access to a library that is stocked 
with a variety of Accelerated Reader coded texts ranging from beginning to advanced readers and 
dual
-
language readers
.   Our goal is for all students to increase the quantity and quality of reading 
as well as oral and written communication skills across all content areas toward California 
Standards.
 
The district and site administration is dedicated in providing the neces
sary forum, time, and 
structure to allow for Professional Development, Professional Learning Communities, curriculum 
planning and Common Core State Standards implementation.  The majority of our student data is 
recorded using the Illuminate Data Systems an
d ESGI which serves as an ongoing evaluation tool 
for progress monitoring.  Multiple measures such as: Common Formative Assessments,  quarterly 
benchmark assessments, IAB data, SBAC data, ELPAC, and Fountas and Pinnell literacy assessments 
are used through
out the school year to drive instruction.  The staff uses multiple measures to track 
the academic progress of each student.  Parents are informed of their child's progress in a timely 
manner via quarterly progress reports and parent teacher conferences. ME
S is now in its second 
year of offering a Dual Immersion classroom. We started with 25 students in kindergarten utilizing 
the 90/10 model and we have now added a first grade classroom with 25 students which provide 
instruction using 80/20 language distribu
tion. We have been preparing for the last two years with 
the help of Dr. Olga Grimalt.
 
Our Mission is to be a culturally diverse community of students, parents and staff dedicated to 
developing higher order thinking skills, individual acceptance, and leade
rship abilities needed for 
academic, personal and social achievement.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Mendota Unified is committed to maintaining a safe, secure, and aesthetically pleasing environment for our students.  The pri
ncipal works daily with the 
custodial staff to ensure a cl
ean and safe school.  In addition to District
-
level support of routine and periodic maintenance needs, MUSD holds high 
standards for cleanliness, appearance, and good repair of all campuses daily and maintains them through the efforts of studen
ts, staff, d
ay custodians, 
evening custodial crew, and District Maintenance Department.  Our maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep th
e school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner.
 
 
Mendota Elementary is the newest elemen
tary site for the city of Mendota.  Starting in 2012, a planning committee comprised of grade level teachers, 
administrators and community members, played an active role in designing a 21st century campus.  In August of 2014, Mendota E
lementary opened its 
doors to 760 students in grades kindergarten through sixth grade.  Due to the newly built state of the art school campus, the
re are no repairs or facility 
improvements needed at this time other than occasional maintenance. Administration meets with Directo
r of Maintenance to go over any minor and 
everyday wear and tear items that need to be addressed and whether our MOT orders are being completed every December.

School Safety Plan
 
The Mendota Elementary School Emergency Response Plan was prepared in compliance with Mendota Unified School District's Gover
ning Board Policy 
and California Education Section 560 which requires
 
all public schools, kindergarten through community college to have written emergency response 
plans which will be reviewed at least annually by the local governing board.   This emergency Organization Plan outlines duti
es for all staff members in 
the even
t of an emergency and/or disaster.  The following teams are formed:  Emergency Operation Center Team, First Aid Team, Sweep a
nd Rescue 
Team, Security Team, Students Accounting Team and our Parent Communication Team.  All indicated personnel have specific r
esponsibilities delegated 
in the event that a practice or real drill is exercised.  Specific areas are designated for parent/ student reunification, fi
rst aid administering and lock down 
situations.
 
Our Site Safety Plan was initially updated on September 2
019 and last Board approved on October 2019.  It is reviewed annually in the Spring by our 
School Site Council and staff/students are exposed to earthquake drills, several lock
-
down drills and protocol per year as well as monthly fire drills. A 
lock
-
down n
otice and communication is sent to parents prior to any drill.
