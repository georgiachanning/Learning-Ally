By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
New Day Academy (NDA) opened and began serving students in August of 2018. Because the school was in its first year 
of operation, the Pupil Outcomes Sections for CAASPP/SBAC and PFT in this r
eport do not have data.  NDA is an 
independent study program so students do not attend classes at a site.  Therefore, the class size sections for elementary 
and secondary grades do not apply to our model and those sections were left blank in this report as
 
well.
 
 
The school is a TK
-
12 charter school, governed by the New Day Academy, Inc. Board of Directors, serving the educational 
needs of students and families who desire an alternative to traditional classroom based public school programs.  The 
charter sch
ool is sponsored by Whitmore Union Elementary School District in Shasta County.
 
 
NDA provides a personalized learning program that complies with California independent study statutes and regulations, 
including but not limited to state independent study att
endance accounting. Enrollment in NDA is available to all students 
in Shasta, Modoc, Lassen, Tehama, Trinity, and Siskiyou. NDA provides the support necessary for each family with enrolled 
students to participate fully with the curriculum and to be success
ful in the program. NDA is a public school so there is no 
tuition.
 
 
The NDA personalized learning program includes a core team of participants dedicated to each student's academic 

 
record, his/her parent (or guardian), the 
student (him/herself), and other academic specialists (Reading, Writing and Mathematics) needed to best support a 
student's academic needs. The NDA teacher assigned to the student will interact with the family/stu
dent in person at 
meetings and will also maintain consistent communication via e
-
mail, text, fax, and phone. Instructors become personal 
and professional guides in the educational journey of each child, partnering with parents to support and encourage 
acad
emic growth using a variety of educational systems and methodologies in order to help students meet or exceed 
school and state learning standards. An ongoing dialogue is established that focuses on these academic elements to 
promote individual student lear

for the success of the student.
 
 
NDA focuses on improving the quality of life for its diverse student population and their families through the delivery of 
an individual
ized, personalized curriculum. The curriculum emphasizes the development of strong core learning 
competencies, knowledge, skills, and attributes necessary to lead a fulfilling and successful life. Particular attention is 
devoted to the core curricular area
s of English/Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies. Additional 
resources and instruction will be provided in the areas of Fine/Performing/Media Arts, Physical Education, Technology, 
and a variety of elective subjects using enrichment vend
ors/community partners, computer software programs, and 
community college classes.
 
 
NDA is fully accredited by The Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) earning a 3 year initial term through 
June 30, 2020.
 
 
Mission Statement:
 
New Day 

support our students with a wealth of educational resources, a commitment to excellence, and a desire to nurture the 
unique nature of every child.

NDA Educational Vision:
 
NDA is based on the belief that each student should be supported with the appropriate resources to realize their full 
potential.
 
 
We operate on the understanding that:
 

 
Strong core competency skills are critical to successful lifelon
g learning.
 

 


 

 
Parents, supported by trained educators with effective, standards based curriculum, are capa
ble of providing an 
excellent education to their children.
 

 

allows them to flourish.
 

 
Students need to become self
-
motivated, organized, compe
tent, lifelong learners, able to use different sources of 
information and complete tasks.
 

 
Powerful teacher
-
student relationships are a motivating factor toward success.
 

 
Opportunities for distance learning and online education are encouraged and supported t
o move students into 
the age of technology.
 

 
Beyond core courses, providing a variety of elective course options allows students to find their individual path 
and life goals.
 
 
How Learning Best Occurs:
 
NDA believes that learning best occurs when:
 

 
Teachers p
artner with parents and students to support, monitor, and encourage academic growth.
 

 
Assessment tools are used to accurately assess student skill levels ensuring that curriculum and methodologies 
are appropriate for each student.
 

 
Students are 
challenged to stretch and meet their potential.
 

 

 

 
Tutoring and small group instruction is offered to provide support to independent learning.
 

 
Student, p
arent, teacher communication is supportive and frequent..
 
 
NDA provides the support necessary for each enrolled student to participate fully with the curriculum and to be successful 
in the program.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
NDA leases two facilities.  The administrative office is located 
in Alturas, California and the Redding Resource Center is 
located in Redding, California.  Both facilities are well maintained, safe, and clean.  In the fall of 2017 a locking safety 
door 
was added to the Redding Resource Center to ensure student and staff
 
safety.  To date both facilities are in excellent 
repair and there are no plans for further improvement.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The nature of our independent stu
dy program requires that parents are directly involved in their children's education on 
a daily basis. A highly qualified NDA credentialed teacher is assigned to each family and they  develop a collaborative, 
encouraging relationship with each family, usin
g coaching and mentoring strategies to assist parents and students.
 
 
Parents also have the opportunity to be involved in the school's Advisory Council by serving as a member of the council or 
by attending quarterly meetings as a participant.  Parents may a
lso be involved by serving as a seated member of the 
Board of Directors, or by attending board meetings, by serving as committee members on various school projects, and by 
giving input at biannual parent meetings.  Annual parent surveys completed in early 
spring provide school administration 
and staff with excellent suggestions for improving our school program.
 
 
Our Director, Laura Blachman, is the administrative contact for parent involvement and Julie Warner, our Board 
chairperson, is the contact for pare
nts interested in participating with the Board of Directors.

New Day Academy (NDA) provides a 3 day all staff training each August and a teacher training event each of the 11 months 
that 
teachers are in active employment status. All developmental days are focused on student improvement and 
achievement. At the beginning of the school year, goals for improvement are developed based on student achievement

pecialist), monthly review of research related 
to educational methods, conference attendance (Charter School Development Center, California Charter School 
Association, Aplus+), Shasta County Office of Education Training and courses offered by private vendo
rs for core course 
instruction.

teacher trainer. This individual has vast experience and knowledge of the teacher position, and offers 
support and 
guidance throughout the year to all NDA teachers.
