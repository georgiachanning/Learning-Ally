D
ear Parents and Guardians:
 
The future looks bright for our 2019/20 school year. We will continue to embrace new changes in 
our classroom instruction, sports, and school activities that will add to the educational 
development of our students and the community of Dixieland. I am a firm believer that all students 
can achieve as long as we provide them with the right learning envi
ronment.
 
 

volunteering in our school and by being involved on committees or parent organizations.

Teacher Collaboration Time
 
Teachers work collaboratively during their grade level
 
planning time to discuss best practices to support their classroom instruction 
aligned to State Standards and the Essential Program Components (EPCs). Teachers will turn in an agenda of topics discussed a
long with 
a teacher sign
-
in sheet. Administration a
nd TSAs provide support during these planning times, if requested.
 
 

-
 
Reading, wRiting, and aRithmetic
 
With support from our PLSS/C&I: Kindergarten 
-
1st will focus on phonemic awareness, on letter/sound instruction, word work, and word 
imaging d
uring whole, guided reading, and small group instruction. Our C&I, will support second and third grade. We will work on 
increasing student stamina and authenticity in reading and writing. They will provide direct support to all grade levels in a
 
variety of
 
strategies, including but not limited to, Kagan, Math Talks, Academic Talk, Thinking Maps, Write From the Beginning, and more
. RtI TSA 
will be pulling targeted students from second through eighth for small group instruction to help intervene and work on s
pecific 
deficiencies. As a staff, we will target our efforts on improving classroom instruction for both first instruction as well as
 
for intervention. 
To enhance our intervention time, Tier 2 time, teachers will get support in continuously monitoring stud
ents, diagnosing  deficiencies, 
and implementing strategies to target those deficiencies
 
.
 
Data from a variety of tests and informal assessments will be used to drive reflective conversations during grade
-
level collaboration time, 
using the cycle of inquir
y process.
 
 
As a staff, we will focus on improving our understanding of and working as a Professional Learning Community. We will examine
 
the 
results of student assessments to see what our students know, compared with what they need to know, and use that i
nformation to 
determine our next steps and drive our instruction.
 
 
For our parents, we will provide opportunities to support their own children. We will continue to send home monthly newslette
rs that 
provide examples of what parents can do with their 
children to stimulate healthy conversation and increase the time they are engaged 
with their child in productive activities. The goal is to give parents an opportunity to learn skills that can help them supp

learning at home...in a fun 
and engaging format for both parent and child. We will continue to solicit parent volunteers to help in their 

offered by PBS 
for pa
rents to learning parenting skills and how to help their children in school.  Students go on various field trips organized by
 
the 
classroom teacher, such as Yosemite National Park, Madera Fair, Monterrey Aquarium, Gilroy Gardens, Discovery Center, Fossil 
D
iscovery 
Center, Coke Hallowell Center, Sycamore Island, and Sugar Pine Railroad.
 
 
Special Education Program: These students are in the general education classroom for the majority of their day. They are prov
ided support 
from a special education staff memb
er during a portion of their time.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Madera Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018, and determined that each school within the district had sufficien
t and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the set
tlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or  instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home.
 
 
Textboo
ks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making t
he textbooks 
used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the state are reviewed by all teachers an
d a recommendation is made to 
the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available fo
r parent examination 
at the district office prior to adoption.
 
 
The table displays 
information collected in October 2018 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

School Facility Conditions
 
and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The main building at Dixieland was built in 1949. The cafeteria was built in 1975. The main office portable, the kindergarten
 
portables, and the other 
eight portables are between four and more than 20 years of a
ge. Refurbishment on the main building was done in 1991. All classrooms are wired for the 
internet, and wireless connections are available from anywhere on campus. Great pride is taken in keeping the campus and buil
dings in the best condition 
possible. In 
2007

08 the exterior of the entire campus was painted. In addition, sun screens were added to all windows in the main building. Al

they fill out if something is in need of
 
cleaning or repair. The request is forwarded to our head custodian who makes a decision if he can repair or clean. 

rounds to look 
for items in 
need of repair, cleaning, or replacing.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
On a regular basis, classrooms and facilities are inspected by the custodial staff and administration to identify needed clas
sroom repairs. District

districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically this
 
includes roofing, plumbing,heating, 
electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. During the 2017

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Dixieland Elementary. The school is always in compliance with all laws, 
rules, and regulations pertaining 
to hazardous materials and state ea
rthquake standards. The School Site Safety plan was last reviewed, updated, and approved, at the January 2018, by 

ster preparedness
 
plan includes 
steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a monthly basis thro
ughout the school year. 
Lockdown drills are held once a semester. Earthquake drills once every semester. Students ar
e supervised before and after school by certificated

School policy requires adults and children to sign in or out in the front office and sign in or out when students are tardy, 
leaving school early, or when 
adults are coming to volunteer or visit. If visiting on campus or in a classroom, adults are
 

aware of this policy and are intermittently reminded during various communications.
 
 
The school policy for dealing with vandalism includes procedures for painting over graffiti before students
 
arrive on campus and replacing broken 
windows immediately. The school has appropriate protections against slipping in hallways and against falls from recreation eq
uipment and landscape 
designs that prevent students from climbing to dangerous heights.
 
 
Dix
ieland staff members are encouraged to communicate their concerns regarding the safety and welfare of all children. We have s
chool rules in place, 
which support consistent and fair consequences. All parents, staff members, and third through eighth
-
grade st
udents are given an opportunity to express 
their feelings and opinions in regards to school safety, the educational program, and the environment. This is done through t
he administration of an 
adult and student safety questionnaire that is completed every y
ear. The adult safety questionnaire is online, and parents are asked to fill it out at home 
or on a Chromebook located in the office. Third through eighth
-
grade teachers administer the safety questionnaire in their classrooms. The staff 
questionnaire is ad
ministered online at a regular staff meeting.
 
 
Dixieland School has established and regularly reinforces a crisis procedure plan, which will take prudent precautions in the
 
event of a crisis situation on 
campus. This plan will be reviewed and 
updated each year. The District is assisting and guiding the implementation of the Crisis Intervention plan through 
ongoing staff development on emergency response procedures. In addition, Dixieland performs practice drills each month in reg
ard to safety. 
A fire drill 
is performed on a monthly basis. An earthquake is performed at least once a year. There are three lockdown drills a year.
