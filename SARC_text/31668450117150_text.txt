About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The school district held a public hearing on September 5, 2019 and determined that each school within the district had suffic
ient and good quality

English learners, are given their own individual standards
-

the classroom 
and to take home.
 
 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, m
aking the textbooks 
used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by 
the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to 
the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available fo
r parent examination 
at the district office prior to adoptio
n.
