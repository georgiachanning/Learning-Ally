By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The school's FIT inspection took place on October 24, 2018. Overall, the school was found to be in "GOOD" standing.
 
 
The district and school maintenance staff consistently work to produce a safe, clean and functional campus that is kept in 
good repair. Wor
k order requests are usually responded to in a timely manner and all safety issues are addressed 
immediately. Four school custodians rotate through the rooms on a daily basis tending to basic cleaning and repair needs. 
Deep cleaning is performed during the
 
winter and spring breaks and during summer months when school is not in session. 
Our restrooms are thoroughly cleaned on a daily basis and a log is kept regarding the cleaning. The head custodian checks 
each restroom at least twice a day to ensure a safe 
and clean environment. Additionally, the head custodian and evening 
custodians, as well as the district ground crew complete daily and weekly checks of the grounds and immediately rectify 
any unsafe conditions. School administration has regular meetings wi
th custodial staff. We emphasize a clean, safe and 
aesthetically pleasing campus, which serves to enhance our instructional program.
 
 
General Description Moreno School opened during the 1965
-
66 school year. The school site is presently equipped to house 
ap
proximately 600 students. In 2008 we added a 6,480 square foot multipurpose room and completed modernization to 
the entire school. The multipurpose room is used to serve breakfast and lunch, for student assemblies, community events, 
and parent workshops. I
t also has additional student and staff restrooms.

This school has 28 classrooms, a multipurpose room that holds 507 occupants, a library, an adapted PE facility and an 
administration building. Seven of those classrooms are portable classrooms. Although t
here is adequate classroom space 
for each grade level, we are consistently challenged to find adequate facilities for support programs. There are six student 
restrooms. The staff lounge, staff workroom, and three staff restrooms are inadequate for the 72 s
taff members that 
report to Moreno. All toilets work properly. All restrooms are cleaned daily and inspected twice a day. Any body fluids are 
cleaned up immediately.
 
 
During the 2006
-
2007 school year, local bond funds (Measure T) and state matching funds w
ere used to provide health 
and safety upgrades, interior improvements to classrooms and restrooms, including upgrading the fire alarm, 
communication and electrical systems, new carpeting, instructional walls. Additionally, modification will be made to 
acco
mmodate disabled persons. The work on this project began in February 2007 and was projected to be completed by 
August 2008. Phase 2 began in December 2008. The school was repainted, the gates were redesigned to meet ADA 
compliance and a new front door was 
installed in the office. This project was completed in June 2009
 
 
During the 2017
-
2018 school year, several safety features were added to the Moreno campus. 8 foot fencing was installed 
as well as railing to increase the height around the kindergarten play
ground. A security system, Raptor, was also installed 
for use for visitor check in.  All visitors must show and enter a valid identification card into the Raptor system prior to 
entry. Additionally, peep holes were installed in classroom doors so staff can
 
see who is knocking prior to opening the 
door.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parent involvement is a vital strategy in the promotion of student achievement, discipline, and self
-
esteem. It is an integral 
part of our school community. The Site English Learner Parent Advisory Council and School Site Council work together to 
make deci
sions about school programs. Moreno School invites all parents to volunteer in a variety of ways, including bi
-
monthly parent volunteer days and "Coffee with the Principal". Our school personnel works diligently to assist parents 
with parent education clas
ses, to coordinate parent volunteer opportunities, and to provide a variety of school and 
community resources for health and welfare issues. Parent education/family night classes are provided each year in the 
area of GATE, AVID, Special Education, and recl
assification. The PTO and a group of staff members also provided Family 
Fun Nights such as Art Easel Night, BINGO for Books, Movie Night, and Trunk or Treat.

School Safety Plan (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Moreno School safety plan is reviewed and revised as necessary at the beginning of each school year. The plan includes 
very specific procedures ranging from fire to chemical attack and intruder/lockdown procedures. The support staff is 
assigned classrooms to assist during drills or in the event of an emergency. A staff development workshop is held at the 
beginning of each school year once the plan is updated and approved by staff. The plan was last reviewed and updated in 
October 2019. D
rills are held monthly and attended by all students and staff. A mock earthquake drill is conducted each 
year in October. There is a clearly articulated visitor policy that states that all visitors must check into the office prior
 
to 
visiting anywhere on c
ampus and provide a valid ID. For parents that wish to volunteer, they must fill out a Volunteer 
Application. The district has created three levels of types of volunteers. Depending on the level of contact with students, 
parents may be required to complete
 

employees are required to wear identification badges. There are 5
-
6 employees monitoring students getting on and off 
the school buses. Students are only released to a parent 
or guardian listed on the emergency card when they are checked 
out during the school day.

General PD Statements
 
Professional development at Moreno School is developed based on student assessment data and teacher need. The school 
site leadership team meets at the close of each year and again prior to school starting to determine needs. Teachers also 
took a survey at 
the end of the 18
-
19 school year and selected PD that they were interested in having in the 19
-
20 school 
year. The site leadership team also meets once a month to determine needs and celebrate successes. Teachers are asked 
to inform their leadership member
s of any specific concerns or areas of need. All certificated staff members participate in 
2 hours of professional development three times a month. Teachers also participate in three full release days for 
Structured Teacher Planning Time where professional
 
development is provided, data is analyzed, and lessons are designed 
based on student need. Paraprofessionals and non
-
instructional staff receive professional development through the 
district classified personnel department. Moreno School has a full
-
time I
nstructional Coach who provides professional 
development on teaching strategies, conducts demonstration lessons, serves as the PBIS Coach as well as assists staff with 
computer
-
based assessments and the state test. She also teaches small groups. Lastly, si
nce we are an AVID Elementary 
School, at least 5 staff attend an AVID 3
