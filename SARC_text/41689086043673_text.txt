By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The mission of North Hillsborough School is to collaborate with parents, staff, and the community to create a positive and 
caring environment where students feel safe and empowered to become active learners, grow f
rom mistakes, develop 
their creativity, and reach their potential as global citizens of an ever
-
changing world.
 
 
North Hillsborough Elementary School is one of three elementary schools located in suburban Hillsborough, California 
with about 10,000 inhabita
nts. The school serves a student population of about 306 students who come from a higher
-
income background. About 59% of the students are White, 27% are Asian, 10% percent are two or more races, four percent 
are Hispanic. In addition, approximately four pe
rcent of the students are English Learners and about nine percent are in a 
special education program.
 
 
The school has 14 regular classroom teachers. All of the regular classroom teachers are fully certified. There is also one 
Learning Center class. In 
addition, North also has a full
-
time librarian, full
-
time music teacher, 90% PE teacher, full
-
time 
innovation lab teacher, full
-
time Resource specialist, full
-
time counselor, 87% reading specialist and full
-
time speech 
therapist. The school shares an instr
umental music teacher and Spanish teacher with the two other schools. An 
occupational therapist is shared with one of the other elementary schools. 
 
 
The curriculum at North is aligned to the Common Core State Standards. In the area of literacy, the school
 
uses Benchmark 
Advance for reading and Units of Study for Teaching Writing by Lucy Calkins for writing. This curriculum stems from the 
principles of Balanced Literacy: shared reading, guided reading, independent reading, shared writing, independent writin
g, 
guided writing, phonics, and word work. For math, Math Expressions is in its third year of implementation. FOSS continues 

 
 
Parent participation is an integral pa
rt of the North school community, Parents participate in and outside the classroom 
by leading committees, organizing school events, and volunteering hours in the library, in the school cafeteria, during 

s Parent Executive Board oversees most of this process and 
collaborates with the principal throughout the year to develop a deep partnership between parents and staff.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Hillsborough City School District inspects all of its facilities, both buildings and grounds, y
early to determine if any 

c 
School Instruction. Inspection by Buildings and Grounds personnel of the eight emergency facility needs
 
specified in Ed. 
Code 17592.72 c was last completed November 2018. The results of this facility survey are available at the District Office. 
In addition, the school district maintains a work order process to ensure efficient service and that emergency rep
airs are 
given the highest priority. Work orders can be prepared by a staff member, or suggested by a parent. Work orders are 
prioritized district
-
wide by the Supervisor of Buildings and Grounds. The district maintenance staff ensures that repairs 
necessar
y to keep the schools in good working order are completed in a timely manner.
 
 
Currently, all of our schools employ a full
-
time day custodian and a full
-
time night cleaning service. All classrooms, staff 
rooms and all student and staff restrooms are cleane
d, and sanitized nightly. Cleaning schedules and duties are monitored 
regularly by the sites and the maintenance department to ensure safe and clean schools. On November 5, 2002, 
Hillsborough voters passed a $66.8 million Proposition 39 bond measure to fin
ance renovation and new construction 
projects on all four campuses. The District has modernized, renovated, newly constructed and equipped housing to meet 
the instructional needs of the students. These funds, along with $2.8 million in State School Facilit
ies funds, were used to 
upgrade fire, life, safety, and accessibility standards. In addition to facilities, much needed upgrades were made to the 

 
 
A new building on the North campus opened at the start of the 200
9
-
10 school year. Funded by Measure B bond funds, 
the building includes a multi
-
purpose room with stage, a warming kitchen, restrooms, a staff room, and storage areas. 
Projects completed during the summer of 2010 included conversion of the old MPR into a n
ew library and computer lab, 
and then the conversion of the vacated spaces into three new classrooms. These projects were funded by the bond and a 
private donor. New playground equipment and play surface were also installed, largely due to the fundraising 
efforts of 
the North Parent Group.
 
 
Additionally, the tennis courts were resurfaced by Hillsborough Recreation. During the summer of 2011, some paving 
rehabilitation work was completed.
 
 
During the summer of 2017, Prop 39 funding provided new occupancy sen
sors, LED exit signs and LED parking lot lighting. 
Also in 2017, funding from Hillsborough Recreation and AYSO, North school sports field was completely renovated with 
new sports grass, irrigation, drainage and a running track.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate 
Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement st
andards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the U
niversity of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority
: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Opportunities for parental involvement in the district and at the school site are abundant, and parents have always given 
generously of their time, attention, and money. Their efforts mean far more than the material benefits they bring; they 
make the stude
nts and teachers feel valued and important. Such feelings contribute directly to educational excellence.
 
 

they arrive by opening car doors
, too late at night, helping put away chairs after school events. Logging on average 14,000 
volunteer hours per year, parents willingly share their expertise, culture, and talents. They assist in the classroom at all 
grades, providing individual and small 
group reinforcement and extension. The school's Parent Group actively supports 


s with students as well as taking on school improvement 


chool Site Council also creates, approves, 
and implements the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement annually.
 
 
At the district level, thousands of additional volunteer hours are given to fund
-
raising events, sponsored by the 
Hillsborough Schools Foundation, 
such as the general campaign, tennis luncheon, dinner dance, and e
-
Scrip program. The 
Hillsborough Schools Foundation provides funds annually to the district in order to enhance the already excellent 
educational programs. These contributions allow us to en

look for ways to be even better.
 
 
Parents and community members have also continuously supported the schools through their votes: In June of 1988 and 
again in 1992, the community passed pa
rcel tax measures in order to maintain school quality. In November of 2002, the 
community of Hillsborough passed Measure B, a $66.8 million dollar school bond measure for the purpose of modernizing, 
renovating, and adding facilities as needed at the four s
chool sites. Measure B was a Proposition 39 bond requiring a 55% 
majority to pass. All members of the school community worked hard to inform the voters about the need for the measure. 
In response, the community show edits strong support for our schools by 
passing the Measure with a 66.45% majority 
vote.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety is our number one priority in the Hillsborough City School District school community. We focus on maintaining safe 
and caring school communities where all students and families feel welcome, valued, and respected.  When students feel 
safe at school 
they can focus on learning.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan, developed in conjunction with the San Mateo County Office of Education and City 
Services, includes disaster preparedness and emergency procedures, and provides the basic guidelines for resp
onsibilities 
and procedures needed to address major emergency situations.  This plan is updated and reviewed with staff annually.
 
HCSD has a District Safety Committee that meets a minimum of 5 times a year for planning and trainings.  The committee 
is comp
rised of two teachers per site, and two parents from each site.  The committee is responsible for keeping the 
Incident Command System organizational chart current, attend disaster preparedness trainings, and be the liaison 
between the District Safety Commi
ttee and Site Safety Committee.  At the site level, the Safety Committee is responsible 
for maintaining emergency backpacks for each classroom, inventorying the emergency shed, and reviewing Big Five 
Protocols with the staff.

programs for all students, including 
special populations such as Special Education and English Learners. All basic educational needs such as instructional 
materials, personnel, staff development, technology, facilities, and maintenance are adequately funde
d. Federal and state 
funds are used appropriately and as required. Through additional funds supplied through the generosity of our parents 
and the larger community, we are also able to provide lower class sizes, curriculum specialists, foreign language pro
grams, 
additional counseling services, and other enhancements to programs. Resources are allocated based on the assessed 
learning needs of students.

Each year the district offers training to its new teachers before the start of school and continues with specific new teacher
 
support for two full years, including participation in the BTSA (Beginning Teachers Support and 
Assessment) program. The 
district provides three full days of professional development for teachers each year (August, October, and March) and 
supports the continual professional growth of teachers in various ways. Teachers participate in off
-
site professi
onal 
development opportunities on a regular basis, and expert coaches and consultants work with teachers, on
-
site as well.  
The district encourages veteran teachers to grow through its HIP (Hillsborough Incentive Plan) Program, and through 
providing suppor
t for teachers who wish to become Nationally Board Certified. Individual teachers are encouraged to take 
classes specific to their subject area in order to ensure they meet the requirements for NCLB certification as highly 
qualified teachers. Compliance tr
aining for certificated and classified staff, such as CPR/First Aid, is held as needed. 
Specialists are also provided training relevant to their assignments, and training for all involved occurs any time new 
standards or materials are adopted.
 
 
By adding i
nstructional minutes on other days, Thursday afternoons are available for both school site and district staff 
development or collaborative work groups. This is in addition to the weekly teacher, grade
-
level, and/or departmental 
collaborative time. TOSAs (T
eachers On Special Assignment) were instituted District
-
wide to provide training for classroom 
teachers in the area of Technology Integration (2015
-
2016) and Math/Science support (2016
-
2017). Web Advisers, Data 
Advisers, and Curriculum Advisers /Lead Teach
ers, also support the furtherance of the school site and district
-
wide goals. 
The administration and staff maintain a mutual support system, with close communication and strong cooperative 
planning. For the 2018
-
2019 school year, a Science Advisor role and
 
a part
-
time Educational Services TOSA are being 
utilized to support curriculum implementation and student growth.
 
 
During the 2018
-
2019 school year, the HCSD is providing professional development to teachers in the areas of 
Reading/Language Arts, Mathemat
ics, and Science. Additional professional development opportunities will be provided 
as needs arise and change.
 
 
During the 2019
-
2020 school year, the HCSD is providing professional development to teachers in the areas of 
Reading/Language Arts, Mathematics
, Science, and Multi
-
tiered System of Supports. Additional professional development 
opportunities will be provided as needs arise and change.
 
 
This year at North, our staff meeting time is mostly dedicated to supporting our teachers to develop their unders
tanding 
and capacity around our school and district goals. Teachers will spend time learning more about balanced literacy, writing 
workshop and empathy. The professional development that teachers receive during these staff meetings is then 
implemented in t
he classroom immediately. Other professional development opportunities that teachers will participate 
in include:
 
 

 
Coaching from a Writing Workshop Expect
 

 
Learning about the NGSS standards
 

 
Learning about the Responsive Classroom Approach
 

 
Learning about the SEL curriculum Kimochis
