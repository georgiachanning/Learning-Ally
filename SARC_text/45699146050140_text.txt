School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
December 16, 2019
 
 
Two teachers from each grade level are selected to serve on the county selection committee. The 
committee
 
has two days 
to look over all the materials that the county has provided to see which programs these teachers
 
want to pilot.  The 
selection committee makes a recommendation to the superintendent.
 
The superintendent takes the recommendation to 
the
 
board, and the materials are adopted.
 
The most recent public hearing to adopt a resolution on the sufficiency of 
instructional materials was in June
 
2018.
 
 
The most recent adopted textbooks were chosen based on the state
-
approved list. The textbook conten
t fits
 
within the curriculum framework adopted by the state.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Meadow Lane Elementary School was built in 1960. The school is comprised of regular classrooms, classrooms fitted for 
the needs of our 
special education students, a PE room, a learning center and a library, a computer lab and a multipurpose 
room, and a new on
-
site preschool.
 
 
Students cannot learn well when they are worried, anxious, or afraid, so all of our district schools provide a saf
e, clean 
learning environment. School buildings and grounds are well
-
supervised and each campus has a strict registration policy 
for all visitors. In addition, all sites have procedures in place to handle emergencies such as fires, earthquakes, or intrud
er
s 
on campus. Procedures are practiced regularly so that students become comfortable with them and are prepared for 
emergencies.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Each school within the Cascade Union Elementary School District has a Comprehensive School Safety Plan that is 

council, and School and Distri
ct administration, and is reviewed on an annual basis. The plan includes procedures for many 
potential hazards including disaster response, intruder or weapons on campus, accident response, general emergencies, 
and school evacuation procedures as well as r
eporting procedures when child abuse is suspected. Staff meets regularly to 
discuss safety issues and takes proactive steps to prevent school
-
related safety issues. The Comprehensive School Safety 
Plan is available for public inspection at all schools thro
ughout the District. The safety plan was last reviewed in November 
2019.

The Cascade Union Elementary School District annually schedules time for professional development sessions for our 
teachers. Additional site
-
based staff development opportunities occur at school sites after school, during evenings, and 
over summer vacation
. Various training opportunities have included topics such as Common Core Standards
-
Based 
instruction; iReady for reading and math; reading and literacy instruction; math, science, and social studies curriculum 
support; assessment information; technology i
ntegration; student asset development; nutrition and physical education; 
brain
-
based learning; and a framework for understanding and working with at
-
risk students. Release days are also 
provided during the school year for teachers to collaborate on the wri
ting benchmarks. The central goal is to provide 
teachers with opportunities to collaborate with colleagues to focus on research
-
based techniques in order to improve 
their practice as educators. New district teachers have opportunities to take part in Allia
nce for Teacher Excellence (ATE), 
a program which pairs novice teachers with their veteran counterparts who come alongside them work diligently to 
expand their proficiencies with lesson design, time management, curriculum best practices, common core standa
rds, and 
appropriate assessment procedures.
