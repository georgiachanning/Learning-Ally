By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Grapeland Elementary provides a safe and clean environment for learning through proper facilities m
aintenance and 
campus supervision. Original school buildings were constructed in 2002. Ongoing maintenance ensures school facilities 
are kept safe, in good working condition, and continue to provide adequate space for students and staff.
 
 
Grapeland Element
ary is proud of its high standards regarding campus maintenance and general housekeeping practices. 
Staff and students enjoy the benefits of having a well
-
maintained and beautiful campus.
 
 
School staff and the maintenance department work together to ensure
 
playgrounds, classrooms, and campus grounds are 
well
-
maintained. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) oversees a work order process enabling school staff to 
communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. The school secretary c
oordinates with 
the principal and custodian to prepare and submit work orders to M&O for resolution. Emergency situations are given 
high priority and resolved immediately by site or district custodial staff.

The principal and day custodian communicate dai

maintenance and operations (M&O) meets with the principal once a month to discuss maintenance

related issues 
associated with campus upkeep, safety, classroom space, equipment, upcoming e
vents, work orders (submitted and 
outstanding), and special requests. The director of M&O then meets with the custodian to conduct a comprehensive 
inspection of the school site, and a summary of the inspection findings is forwarded to the principal.
 
 
Schoo

and minor repairs. M&O provides formal training twice 
a year on the proper use of equipment, cleaning procedures, and 
chemical usage. One full
-
time day custodian is responsible for keeping the campus clean and fully operational. The 

t restrooms, and cleaning the cafeteria after 
meals are served. Restrooms are checked twice during school hours as a proactive measure to keep facilities stocked, safe, 
and sanitary. Every morning before school begins, the day custodian inspects school fac
ilities for safety hazards and 
maintenance issues that require attention before staff and students arrive on campus. Any graffiti or signs of vandalism 
are removed immediately.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019

The Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan was originally developed for Grapeland Elementary in collaboration with local

administration to fulfill Senate Bill 187 requirements. Components of this plan include child abuse 
reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for 
safe arrival and departure from schoo

plan was reviewed in August 2019 and updated in December 2019. The School Safety Plan is shared with the staff annually.   
In addition, the School Safety Plan was reviewed b
y the Rancho Cucamonga Police Department and then approved by our 
School Site Council in January 2020.
