School Description
 
At Beresford Elementary School, students are prepared to make a positive 
contribution to the 
community. We believe that character building and a rigorous academic program are 
interdependent and are essential to our students' success. At Beresford, we use the Lifelong 
Guidelines and Life Skills as a way to help our children beco
me responsible citizens and achieve 
their personal best. Beresford provides a standards
-
based curriculum in a stimulating learning 
environment. Our hope is that each Beresford child will continue to be a lifelong learner and a 
contributing member of our so
ciety. Beresford's mission is that school staff, students and families 
be a community of lifelong learners who work together to provide a positive, safe and motivating 
environment. Our staff is committed to a set of core values that guide us in how we will
 
work 
together in order to achieve our vision of an exceptional learning environment for all students. Two 
major goals are:
 
1) All students will meet or exceed the San Mateo
-
Foster City School District's Standards for Student 
Achievement.
 
2) Students will 
be responsible citizens who care and contribute to the world we live in.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enr
ollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Lib
rary). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a 
workstation may be used (depending on availabili
ty), the types of software programs available on a 
workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The San Mateo
-
Foster City School District makes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe and functional. To assist in these
 
efforts, the 
District has developed and the B
oard of Trustees has approved, a District
-
wide Facilities Implementation Master Plan in order to bring each school site 
up to district facility standards for educational excellence. To support that effort, in 2008 the community passed a $175 mil
lion facili
ties bond to repair, 
renovate, upgrade and increase capacity at District schools. Bond funding has been used to upgrade facilities over the past 1
0 years. A lunch shade 
structure and age
-
appropriate play structures were added to the campus, student classro
om furniture was replaced, exterior painting was completed 
and perimeter fencing was installed for school security.
 
 
In 2015, the community once again passed a $142 million bond (Measure X). Phase I is well underway, adding classrooms and a g
ym at Abbott a
nd Borel 
and a gym at Bayside Academy, in addition to a new fourth elementary school in Foster City.
 
 
With the passing of the State Facilities Bond in November 2016, the District will seek any State Modernization matching funds
 
on a percentage basis to 
ass
ist with the expenditures for any major planned modernization work projects.
 
 
The District's Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are c
ompleted in a timely manner, 
while the Operations sta
ff ensures that the schools are kept clean. A work order process through a program called "Akita Box" is used to ensure effic
ient 
service; emergency repairs are given the highest priority. In addition to responding to emergency repairs in a timely manner,
 
the maintenance department 

 
 
Most District schools are staffed with at least one day and one night custodian to provide a clean and hazard
-
free environment. Some 
of the larger 
schools, particularly the middle schools, are staffed with one day custodian and two or three night custodians. The Principal
, along with the maintenance 
staff, work with the custodians to develop cleaning schedules to ensure clean and safe s

which are available at the District Office. In addition, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the Stat
e of California's Office of Public 
School Construction to ev
aluate the conditions of each schools facility. This evaluation is completed annually for each site. The following school sit

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

unity building events including the Back to School 
Barbecue and the annual Dance Party. The school has an active PTA and School Site Council that support the achievement of the
 
school's goals. The PTA's 
goal is to build community through communication. The

Foster City School D
istrict Board of Trustees and the School District's Strategic Plan.
 
 
Comprehensive School Safety Plans, developed individually for each school in conjunction with the San Mateo County Office of 
Education and City 
Services, include disaster 
preparedness and emergency procedures. The School Safety Plans provide role responsibility guidelines and processes required 
to address major emergencies. Annually, the District utilizes the services of School Innovations & Achievement to review each
 
schoo

The San Mateo
-
Foster City School District is committed to providing quality professional 
development opportunities for all staff. Training is available 
through three professional development days, staff meetings, scheduled release times during the school year, on early release
 
days and during the 
summer. Our primary focus for professional deve
lopment is aligning instruction to meet the California State Standards and the implementation of our 
adopted materials for mathematics and English Language Arts/English Language development. Professional learning opportunities
 
integrate content 
development
 
and research
-
based instructional practices to meet the needs of all learners, especially English Learners, Students with Disabilities and 
Socio
-
economically Disadvantaged. Professional Development in SMFCSD is grounded in the California State Standards an
d the research from the 
California State Adopted ELA/ELD, Mathematics and NGSS Frameworks. Elementary teachers have the opportunity for training in l
anguage and literacy, 
science and mathematics. Middle School teachers receive subject specific professional
 
development on the California Standards and strategies to support 
conceptual understanding and improve student learning.
 
 
Teachers engage in a variety of Professional Development structures including, site or department specific PD, teacher learni
ng commu
nities within and 
across sites and in departments or grade levels 
-
 
both in large and small groups. Our district also coordinates district
-
level training with site
-
based 
professional development opportunities based on site data. Over the last year, distric
t and site leaders developed professional learning opportunities by 
evaluating and adjusting our professional growth strategies, first by gathering immediate feedback (e.g., exit tickets and fe
edback surveys) from teacher 
and leader training and collaborat
ion sessions. This data was then used to adjust and focus training and collaboration strategies during the year. We also 
evaluate and adjust professional growth strategies through on
-
going examination of student performance data (academic and wellness). Di
strict 
leadership meets quarterly with school leaders to review current student data, to identify the professional growth causes for
 
student successes and 
challenges, to monitor the impact of key professional growth strategies and to plan forward. This wor

SPSA. In parallel with this work, site leaders lead the same process with teacher teams using more specific data (e.g. grade
-
level and classroom data), 
where they couple that data with teacher reflections 
on their professional learning and plan month
-
to
-
month adjustments in professional learning 
strategies and yearly adjustments in their SPSAs. District leaders also lead a similar process with SMFCSD teacher union repr
esentatives to elicit their 
feedback on
 
the district professional growth strategies and to get their recommendations for strategy adjustments in the district LCAP. A
dditionally, 
starting this year, SMFCSD will gather once
-
a
-
year survey feedback from teachers on their professional learning needs
 
and on their experience of current 
strategies which will inform yearly adjustments to LCAP and SPSA professional growth strategies.
 
 
Our beginning teachers also receive additional professional development provided by our District
-
based Induction program. 
Veteran teachers can 
participate in a Peer Assistance Review (PAR) program for individual support.
