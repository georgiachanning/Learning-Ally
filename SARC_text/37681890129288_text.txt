School Description
 
Eucalyptus Hills is a Transitional Kindergarten school consisting of 5 classrooms.  We have two 
classrooms of 90/10 Spanish Immersion and three classrooms of traditional English instruction.  All 
5 classroom collaborate dail
y and move the school forward with the vision that all EH students are 
"our students" rather than the ones on our roster. We are dedicated to providing our students with 
the foundational behavioral and academic skills necessary to prepare our students for 
Kindergarten.  We utilize School
-
Wide Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (SWPBIS) in 
which we explicitly teach our students the behavioral expectations they need to be safe, respectful 
and responsible.  In addition to SWPBIS, we also utilize the 
Sanford
-
Harmony Social Skills programs 
to teach our students cooperation, empathy and effective communication.  We provide our 
students with a rigorous but age
-
appropriate academic instruction that prepares our students for 
the demands of Kindergarten.  We
 
are also equally dedicated to allowing our students the time to 
explore their environment, enhance their curiosity and imagination through play. Our play
-
based 
learning supports student literacy, math and science cognition, and social
-
emotional well
-
being
.
 
 
Our mission at Eucalyptus Hills is to develop solid behavioral and academic foundational skills for 
all students.
 
 
Our vision is that all Eucalyptus Hills students will be enthusiastic, confident, cooperative learners, 
and actively engaged in their 
own learning.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additi
onal information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The school was built in the early 1960s and has seen several programs on campus in the
 
last 15 years. Six years ago EH became the exclusive TK program 
for the district.  It was recently painted by the district. Buildings and restrooms are clean, well
-
equipped, and in good working order.  We have a small 
playground with new equipment added t
his year and a large field.  Our site is currently looking into adding additional shading space, new storage space 
and possible adding a restroom for the office.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities t
eam to perform an inspection using a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction.

Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents are a vital compone
nt of our academic success.  Parent volunteers, in and out of the classroom, provide invaluable support to our teachers and 
students.  We have multiple programs that provide opportunities for our families to be active members of our school community
.  One 
such opportunity 
is Community Helpers Month. Community Helpers Month gives our parents the opportunity to talk to our students about their pro
fessional careers.  We 
had military, paramedics, law enforcement, fire department and other professions represente
d.  We have an active Booster and Garden Club.  Parent 
positions on the School Site Council are filled by an election.  We keep our parents informed about upcoming events, district
 
updates, classroom bulletins, 
flyers, etc. through Illuminate (in both Engl
ish and Spanish) and Coffee Talk with the Prinicipal. We, at Eucalyptus Hills, understand the importance of our 
parents and are always seeking ways to collaborate with them and to include them as much as possible.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following inf
ormation relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The safety of our students and staff is of utmost importance at 
Eucalyptus Hills. Secure gates, traffic flow, mandated visitor sign
-
in, lunch/recess rotations, 
and pick
-
up procedures are all determined with school safety in mind.  Eucalyptus Hills is an active member of the Community Safety Co
mmittee that 
reviews commu
nal safety protocol twice a year.  In addition, our school partners with local fire and law officials to conduct assemblies o
n safety and 
emergency protocol.   Our School Site Safety Committee is composed of the following members:  1) The principal, 2) A t
eacher representative, 3) At least 
one parent/guardian whose child attends the school, 4) One classified employee, 5) Other members if desired. (Ed Code 35294.1
) This team oversees the 
School Safety Plan.
 
 
Eucalyptus Hills has a comprehensive School Safety
 
Plan which serves as a unified tool that guides all parties in the event of a school emergency.  The 
School Safety Plan is revised and reviewed by the Eucalyptus Hills Staff members at the beginning of each school year.  Staff
 
members and students 
practic
e the safety procedures outlined in the School Safety Plan to effectively and immediately respond to a natural disaster or th
reat.  We have monthly 
safety drills where we practice the procedures outlined in our safety plan. Our students and school staff al
so meet with our local fire department and 
sheriff's department to promote school wide safety.

Professional development for the previous school years focused on the development of Transitional Kindergarten Standards and 
the correlating trimester 
benchmark assessments. The Eucalyptus Hills (EH) teachers meet in 
Professional Learning Communities (PLC) on a weekly basis to review student progress 
through common assessments. EH teachers attended a Sanford Harmony program training in addition to ongoing professional devel
opment for School 
Wide Positive Behavior Inter
ventions and Supports.  Professional development in the 2019
-
2020 school year will focus on the exploration, research, and 
implementation of play
-
based learning experiences for our students. The EH teachers have conducted research reviews on the importance
 
of play for 
children and will be attending the Southern California Kindergarten conference to further develop their expertise. In additio
n, EH teachers engage in 
district
-
wide professional development focused on our student profile and continues in ongoin
g development in Math Transformations.
