Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

blem solving and 
creativity.  Together we respectfully value each other and our unique contributions.  We teach, practice and promote 
tolerance by embracing diversity for all. Each of us demonstrates integrity, honesty and accountability. We are global 
cit
izens preparing for the world of tomorrow."
 
 
Turtle Rock has been recognized as a California Distinguished School in 2002, 2010, 2014, and most recently, in 2018.  The 
award is based, in part, on several factors including outstanding student performance on
 
statewide assessments , 
exemplary progress of English Language Learners on various academic indicators, and low rates of absenteeism and 
behavioral incidents. The stake holders of the Turtle Rock community consistantly express high levels of satisfaction 
with 
the school environment and quality of instruction teachers.
 
 
Turtle Rock offers programs to meet the needs of diverse learners.  The  AAPAS (Alternative Program for Academically 
Advanced Students) Program is a magnet program that serves students who q
ualify for a challenge level environment.  
The  SEI (Sheltered English Immersion) program serves those students who are learning English, The GATE (Gifted and 
Talented Education) program adds depth, complexity, creativity and rigor to the our general educa
tion classrooms.
 
 
The Turtle Rock staff, students, parents, and community are to be commended for their cooperative spirit. It is with the

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of
 
Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathe
matics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS]
 
for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or caree
r technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The Local Control Funding Formula has replaced 

place of more than 40 specific funding categories, the new model has established three sources of state funding with 
increased local discretion to determine how best to spend those f
unds in the service of students.  All districts receive a 
BASE of per
-
student funding that varies slightly depending on grade level.  All districts also receive SUPPLEMENTAL 
funding.  IUSD has used BASE and SUPPLEMENTAL funding to support the following pro
grams:
 
 
Site Programs and Services:  1) Support professional learning and teacher coaching through induction program, content 
TOSAs and teacher mentor program , 2) provide summer school and summer athletic programs, 3) Allocating site funding 
and staffing 
to support student achievement through support of Professional Learning Communities (PLC) and site PLC 
coaches, 4) Elementary P.E. paraprofessionals, 5) Support for English language learners, 6) Elementary science, music, and 
art programs, 7) Purchase text
books and instructional materials, 8) Develop a technology rich learning environment 
including; Technology matching programs, Technology Maintenance fund and site technology support staff, 9) Maintain 
previously implemented class
-
size reduction, 10) Additi
onal secondary sections to reduce class size, 11) Middle school 
zero period program, 12) Maintain positive behavioral intervention and support program, 13) Maintain site staffing with 
full
-
time assistant principals, 14) 450:1 counseling ratio, support for 
large elementary schools and elementary classroom 
aides, 15) Support interventions and supplemental programs impacting English learners, low income and foster youth, 16) 
Continue to build Career
-
Technical Education pathways and blended 0n
-
line learning opp
ortunities for students, 17)

Finally, CONCENTRATION grant funding equal to 50 percent of the base is provided to di
stricts in which English
-
learners, 
low
-
income students and foster youth exceed 55 percent of the total enrollment.  Irvine Unified School District is not 
eligible for concentration funding because its enrollment does not exceed the 55 percent threshold.

Turtle Rock Elementary School and the Irvine Unified School District are dedicated to continuous professional 
improvement.  For the past 3 years, Turtle Rock Elementary School
 
and IUSD have been committed to providing a high 
caliber of training for teachers in order to move their instruction into the 21st Century and meet the challenges of 
implementing the CCSS.
 
 
The major emphasis for  professional development at Turtle Rock t

wide goals for improving student achievement 
included efforts to refine our instructional focus based on student achievement data from th
e results of Star Math and 
Reading Renaissance results, student work samples, teacher's observations  and CAASP results and to intervene and 
support all students more effectively.   Our site has provided workshops for teachers, in the area of Language Arts
 
and  
Thinking Maps to respond to writing  with "Write from the Beginning" strategies. Five teachers attended a Summer teacher 
leader training for "Write from the Beginning" and they led a professional development for teachers in after
-
school 
workshops. Ou
r PLC coach meets once a week, with grade level teams, to support the continuing collaborative 
development of  research based instructional strategies, practices and assessments, as well as methods to differentiate 
instruction to better meet student needs.
  
IUSD is committed to ensuring that teachers are continuing to be supported 
during the Math CCSS implementation and teachers attended training this year which provided updated methodology by 
the Irvine Math Project. Our teachers have also implemented a ne
w Language Arts adoption and our professional 
development has focused on the methodologies and components within the new textbooks.  Technology's goal , to 
integrate its use throughout the school day and increase teachers' knowledge, is being supported by 
our site TACs and 
district EdTech TOSA. Teachers are provided with in
-
class modeling, individual mentoring, and after school trainings.   
Turtle Rock teachers are committed to providing rigorous, engaging,  and dynamic instruction to all of our students.
