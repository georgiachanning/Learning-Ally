School Description
 
James Monroe Elementary School (Monroe Elementary) is a Dual Immersion, STEAM 
English/Spanish California Distinguished School and recipient of a Title I Academic Achievement 
Award. Monroe Elementary is located at the corner of Maple Stre
et and East Central Avenue in 
Santa Ana, California.
 
 
Monroe Elementary Dual Language Immersion program is a unique opportunity that brings 
together Spanish and English
-
speaking students to develop full bilingualism and biliteracy skills in 
both dominant E
nglish speaking students and Spanish speaking students. Monroe's Dual Immersion 
program starts in pre
-
school where 90% of instruction is given in Spanish and 10% in English. The 
percentage of Spanish decreases as the percentage of English increases, until 
students begin their 
fourth
-
grade year, with 50% of instruction in English and 50% in Spanish. In addition Monroe 
Elementary utilizes Project Lead the Way to deliver STEAM curriculum to our Dual Language and 
Structured English Immersion students. 
 
 
Vision:
 
It is the vision of Monroe Elementary to build a community of lifelong learners who will strive to 
achieve their highest academic potential in a safe educational environment using a curriculum 
based on the California Core State Standards, which includes a
 
rigorous program for all students. 
Supported by our staff, parents, business partners and community members, students will 
question, reflect, problem
-
solve, and develop strong character to become contributing members 
of the school and community. Student a
chievement is our highest priority, we will prepare our 
students to meet the rigorous and challenging standards. Students will demonstrate the 
knowledge, skills, and values necessary to become productive citizens in the 21st century. The 
world of technolog
y is constantly changing and our students must adapt to these challenges. Our 
students will have access to a variety of technology
-
based resources. We believe that all children 
can and will learn to the best of their abilities and will prepare them for Col
lege and Career. We are 
confident and proud of our students' success throughout their educational years. 
 
 
Mission:
 
The Monroe Elementary School educational program is dedicated to the achievement of academic 
excellence, coupled with the development of a d
esire among all students to enthusiastically pursue 
the acquisition of knowledge throughout their lives. Teachers and support staff are dedicated to 
actively engage students in meaningful learning activities through direct, systematic, and 
purposeful stand
ards
-
based instruction that is driven by ongoing assessment of progress. 
Assessment results are analyzed regularly to foster the improvement of both group and individual 
student performance. Professional development sessions for certificated staff, parapro
fessional 
training, and parent education are concentrated on assisting children with reaching or exceeding 
California grade
-
level standards. The schoolwide focus is on English language development with an 
emphasis on the extension and enrichment of academi
c vocabulary acquisition.
 
 
Our goal is to provide educational experiences that will: 
 

 
Provide a comprehensive academic program.
 

 
Promote the value of reading and writing skills as critical to their success.
 

 
Teach English language development to our 
English language learners.
 

 
Provide coping skills to students to accept new challenges and risk failure.
 

 
Develop values and a strong sense of right and wrong.
 

 
Encourage students to pursue academic excellence toward entering a university 
through the Californ
ia Common Core State Standards.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
dist
rict office.

maintained and kept 
safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. Maintenance and Oper
ations (M&O) employs an electronic work order system enabling school staff 
to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Most of the school's repairs and maintenan
ce projects are 

fied, professional trade specialists. Emergency situations are immediately resolved either by the school custodian 
or district maintenance staff, based upon the nature of the situation. Day and evening custodians work closely as a team and 
with the princip
al for routine 
maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events preparations. The principal and day custodian communicate daily to di
scuss campus cleaning 
needs and safety concerns. Every morning before school begins, the custodian and principal ins
pect facilities for safety hazards, graffiti, and other 
conditions that require removal prior to students and staff entering school grounds. School safety and cleanliness are the cu

strongly emphasized as a component of their 

chemicals, and use of equipment. The day custodians are responsible for following an established set of cleaning standards an
d prioritization procedures 
fo
r general campus maintenance. The day custodian checks restrooms twice a day as a proactive measure in keeping facilities wel
l stocked, safe, and 
sanitary. The evening custodians are responsible for thorough cleaning of classrooms, office areas, and restro
oms. Groundskeepers are dispatched by 
the district office to perform general maintenance of landscaping, gardening, sports fields, and irrigation systems.
