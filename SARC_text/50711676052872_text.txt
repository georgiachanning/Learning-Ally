By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Mission Statement: It is the mission of Wilson Elementary
 
that all scholars will grow and learn at the highest levels 
through a collective commitment of equity, advocacy, and responsibility.
 
 
School Description: Wilson School is situated in the central east suburban section of Modesto in Stanislaus County. It is
 
one of the twenty two elementary schools in the district and is composed of seven older classrooms built in 1929 and the 

despite their ag
e because of the care they receive from Wilson's meticulous custodial staff. Centrally located within a 
neighborhood of low to high income homes, the school serves a diverse group of approximately 270 preschool through 
6th grade students. Students living i
n our attendance area are mainly Hispanic, White and African American. The income 
level of the families falls into low to medium socioeconomic range with the majority of students meeting free or reduced 
meal eligibility. This year the CEP allows all studen
ts to receive two free nourishing meals each day. There are ten general 
education teachers, one resource teacher, and one pre
-
formal teacher. In addition to the K
-
6 staff, Wilson has one three 
day per week computer literacy teacher, two prep providers one 
day per week each who provide 45 minute prep time for 
certificated teachers, one part
-

classroom, teachers teach English Language Arts with Macmillan McGraw Hill (MMH) for English Language Arts (ELA), 
Engage New York for Mathematics (1st
-
6th grades) and Early Math with Engage NY as supplemental material in 
kindergarten. The school population
 
includes approximately 55 English Language Learners which is 19% of the student 
population. English Language Development (ELD) instruction is taught systematically throughout the day along with 30 
minutes of designated ELD instruction daily in each classr
oom.
 
 
During the 2018
-
19 school year, Wilson students in third through sixth grades completed the Smarter Balanced 
Assessment Consortium (SBAC). The results have been reported and most grade level cohorts showed growth in English 
Language Arts. Thirty
-
one 
percent of Wilson's third graders met or exceeded standard in ELA while twenty eight percent 
met or exceed standard in mathematics. While twenty
-
three percent of Wilson's fourth graders met or exceeded standard 
in ELA, and twenty
-
six percent met or exceed 
standard in mathematics. Fifth graders performed at thirty
-
three percent 
met or exceed standard in ELA, and twelve percent met or exceeded standard in mathematics. Fifth graders also continued 
to take the Physical Fitness Test, and they participated in the
 
computerized science test. Wilson's sixth graders met or 
exceed standard in ELA at forty
-
eight percent, and thirty
-
four percent of the sixth grade scholars met or exceed standard 
in mathematics. Last year, 5 out of 11 teachers taught afterschool intervent
ion. In addition, school
-
wide interventions and 
enrichment periods were implemented four days per week during the school day. Wilson teachers will continue to provide 
students with interventions and enrichment throughout the school day as well as after sch
ool during the 2019
-
20 school 
year. Teachers will be using Phonics for Reading, Rewards, Language for Learning, Reading Mastery, Corrective Reading to 
teach in
-
school and RISE curriculum for interventions as well as provide enrichment supports. School Plan

Last year, teachers were provided with collaboration time 15 times per school year due to early release days provided by 
Modesto City Schools. In addition to the 15 collaboration times
 
provided by the district, teachers were also given extra 
time (after district collaboration time) to meet with their grade level teams to discuss student data, design lessons from 
the CCSS and compose and review their SMART goals and common formative asse
ssments. Furthermore, teachers were 
given the opportunity to take one professional development day per year to focus on CCSS and lesson design. This 
collaboration time was facilitated with the assistance of the three teacher leaders and the principal. Duri
ng the 2019
-
2020 
school year, the District has provided 26 days of collaboration time. In addition, following the 2018
-
19 format, teachers 
will continue to be given the option to meet with their grade level teams and instructional coaches after district 
co
llaboration time to analyze data, design lessons and create common formative assessments. Wilson stakeholders 
remain committed to strengthening the character of every student through the promotion of the Modesto City School's 
Character Education program an
d the use of PeaceBuilder and SecondStep curriculum. Wilson also has the longest running 
mentorship program in the district with E&J Gallo. This year, we will celebrate our 22nd year where Gallo employees come 
to Wilson to mentor our students. In addition,
 
over the past two years, our Positive Behavior Intervention and Support 
(PBIS) team has been trained using Restorative Practices. Wilson's PBIS team remains committed to training all staff 
members regarding the importance of the development of the "whole"
 
student by using various Restorative Practices 
strategies. During the 2019 
-
20 school year, there are professional development plans to teach and support the following: 
Restorative Practice classroom circle training and strategies, PeacePath, and Trauma I
nformed Schools Framework to 
teachers and support staff, along with character traits assemblies. Both the intermediate and primary playgrounds have 
PEACE PATHS, a "safe place" where students go to resolve their own peer conflicts with guidance. When approp
riate, 
some teachers opt to use the Restorative Practices circle talks and/or offer comfort corners (a temporary place for 
students to find comfort), and Peacebuilder Center/Reset Zone to students throughout the school day. Using one or more 
of the aforeme
ntioned strategies, Wilson's suspension rate for 2018
-
19 academic year was 1.6%. In addition, Wilson's 
PBIS team is committed to meeting five times per year to review discipline data and discuss strategies that promote civility 
and develop pro
-
social behav
iors in student. The PBIS team consists of the principal, campus assistant, After School 
Program Director, Center for Human Services employees, and teachers. The following positive behavior activities will 
continue to be implemented at Wilson: Fun Dance Fr
idays, Game Days, Popcorn and lunch with the Principal, PeaceBuilder 
school
-
wide recognition, monthly positive playground rewards, daily PeaceBuilder recognition and certificates for Praise 
Notes, and public recognition at Student of the Month Assemblies. 
Students have the opportunity to participate in many 
activities at Wilson. The ASES Program (after
-
school program) and RISE Intervention which provides a safe environment 
to students after school hours in which they may participate in intervention and a va
riety of activities that include support 
during designated homework times with a focus on math two days a week, Jr. Chef, field trips and sports competitions 
with other MCS students. The director is in active communication with the school administration an
d there is a 
collaborative effort by both for the benefit of all students. There are also opportunities for students to participate in 
chorus, music (strings and/or band), Mighty Milers, 10K with a Cop, ASB, Wilson Baseball, Art Restores Kids, Traffic Patr
ol, 
Garden and Recycling Clubs. Wilson Elementary School has an extremely successful state preschool. Communication 
between Wilson's pre
-
primer teacher, principal and K
-
6 teachers is on
-
going. Beginning of the year Kindergarten 
assessment results from form
er pre
-
formal students was and will be an ongoing discussion with teachers as Wilson strives 
to ensure all students enrolled in these programs are ready for Kindergarten. The transition to Kindergarten is enhanced 
by the continuity of our pre
-
formal progra
m. Kindergartners are given an ELA assessment (DIBELS) at the beginning of 
every year. During the 2018
-
19 school year, Wilson's incoming kindergartners and parents of kindergartners were invited 
to attend four kindergarten readiness courses in the spring. 
This was the fourth time for our pre
-
kindergartners to become 
familiar with kindergarten procedures and teachers. It was also a time for parents to become familiar with the Common 
Core State Standards, end of year outcomes, staff, attendance procedures, an
d general school site procedures. School

Understanding with the Merced County Office of Education/Migrant Education Region 3. These services are directly 
provided by Migrant Education Region 3 st
aff to preschool and elementary students. Migrant Education supplemental 
instructional services are provided through a combination of site and home base models. Migrant students are identified 
and recruited by two Support Services Liaisons that are housed 
at Pearson Education Center.
 
 
The current migrant student eligibility list is maintained on a monthly basis and is cross referenced with the district stude
nt 
data base to keep student lists current. The Supportive Services Liaisons additionally provide ref
errals for supplemental 
health and social services to migrant families identified in the Modesto City Schools attendance area. The migrant parents 
assist the district and region in evaluating migrant educational services through their participation in the 
Migrant Parent 
Advisory Committee that meets six times per year. Migrant Education services are determined each year in collaboration 
with the Modesto City Schools District to maintain or modify them based on a review of prior year services and funding

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Wilson is located in a medium to low 
socio
-
economic neighborhood in a beautiful and historical area located in southeast 
Modesto. In an effort to create and foster a secure learning environment, an abundance of services and resources are 
available to our student community including: After Sch
ool Learning Program, exposure to Peacebuilder and SecondStep 
curriculum, Restorative Justice Practices, monthly meetings with the principal  and Student Achievement and Character 
Education assemblies. In addition, Wilson has the following safety plan elem
ents in place: students are acknowledged and 
respected; social services support systems are coordinated; the school is alert to exposure to safety issues; school building
s 
and classrooms are well maintained; campus security and safety is coordinated with l
aw enforcement; parents and staff 
members actively participate in regular safety meetings.
 
 
The Wilson School Safety Plan is designed to provide information regarding the safety of students and staff in all situations
. 
Wilson Elementary School has a Safety
 
Committee made up of administration, teaching staff, a custodial representative, 
an administrative assistant, yard duty supervisors, and parent volunteers. With the assistance of California Safe Schools, 
the Wilson Safety Committee has adopted a comprehen
sive School Safety Plan most recently reviewed on April 24, 2019 
and is scheduled for a review on November 20,2019. The committee meets two times per year to review safety concerns 
and school procedures in an attempt to improve or enhance a safe school env
ironment. The plan is reviewed each year 
for effectiveness and is adjusted as needed. Procedures to be followed in the event of any emergency at the school, or as 
a result of a situation in the neighborhood which may impact the school site, school crisis p
rocedures, evacuation plans, 
dress code, visitor policies, conduct code and sexual harassment procedures as well as provision of learning opportunities 
that promote tolerance and acceptance of differences are outlined in this plan. Safety drills are schedu
led throughout the 
school year to train students and staff to respond in case of emergency situations such as: fire, lockdown, earthquakes 
and evacuation of school buildings. Evacuation routes and pertinent information to assist officials to ensure student
 
and 
staff safety are also included in the plan. Before and after school, the student Safety Patrol crosses students at various 
crosswalks around the school and an adult crossing guard is at the busy intersection on Yosemite Blvd. There is an After 
School 
Program that begins at the end of the regular school day and is open until 6:00 pm. Students are supervised and 
receive academic support until they are picked up by their parent/guardian. All kindergarten students are dismissed and 
released only to a paren
t, legal guardian or school official. Once school has begun all gates are locked, except the one 
directly in front of the front office. Visitors who come on campus must come into the office are logged into the RAPTOR 
System, and they wear a visitor's badge
 
which are dated and have a picture ID. When visitors leave the school site ID 
Badgers are collected by the office staff. Yard duty supervisors are assigned to before school, recess and after school yard 
supervision in designated areas.  The lunchtime rece
ss is supervised by adult yard duty supervisors and the principal.

Professional development in MCS is data driven using research
-
based best practices to ensure our students receive 
guaranteed and viable curriculum in every grade, in 
every school.    We use formative and summative data to drive our 
instructional decisions and focus for professional development.  To this end, we utilize multiple structures  to provide 
high
-
quality professional development to our staff including:  summer
 
training, preservice
-
days, district wide professional 
development days, after school workshops, Saturday workshops, substitute
-
release days, instructional coaching, a BTSA 
and PAR program,  and most recently a 0.5% compensation package for those who choos
e to complete an extra 6 hours 
of professional development.
 
 
MCS has prioritized our focus on mathematics, literacy across grades and content areas, collaboration, welcoming 
schools/customer service, and building our capacity as professionals.  This has be
en in addition to the needed training in 
new adoptions, curriculum and standard updates and the like.  The professional development is sustained through site 
administration, district and site level instructional coaches, and intervention specialists.  In t
he 2019
-
202 academic year, 
a new division was also created in order to increase the quality and quantity of professional development provided to 
classified, certificated, and managers alike.
