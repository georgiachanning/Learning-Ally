philosophy.  We are a multilingual, multicultural, 
talented and dedicated staff.  We bring our diverse experiences and expertise to nurture bilingual, 
biliterate and multicultural resilient students.  As active teachers and lifelong learners, we create a

literate learning environment for each family in our multicultural 
community.  At Sylvia Mendez we provide opportunities for vertical and horizontal school wide 
collaboration to encourage a variety of voices, viewpoints and experti

guiding, explaining, facilitation, differentiating and tapping into students' cultural capital in creative 
ways.  This includes providing responsive curriculum and connecting with families and using district 
support for ongoin

Our students come to school with a wealth of knowledge and experiences enriched by their home 

cultural diversity as a bridge to engagem
ent and excellence in academics. Our students learn to be 
critical thinkers, proficient in both Spanish and English, to become confident and active global 

wo
rk to provide each student and every family with equitable access to the highest quality 
education to achieve their fullest potential. We pride ourselves on cultivating bilingualism and 
multiculturalism. Join us!

DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district
 
and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Intern
et access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use 
restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a 
workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a 
workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By F
ebruary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control F
unding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
sta
te and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the
 
school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Williams legislation calls for the schools to have enough books in core classes for all students and asks districts to reveal
 
whether those books are 
presenting information outlined in the California content stand
ards.  Textbook materials are adopted by the school board following a rotating adoption 
cycle for subject specific state adopted textbooks and instructional materials.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district administers a scheduled maintenance program to ensure that all classrooms 
and facilities are well maintained and in good repair. A work 
order process alerts district personnel of any maintenance needed to be performed and ensures that emergencies are given the 
highest priority.
 
 
Safety issues are the top priority for Maintenance
 
and Operations. District maintenance supervisors inspect school sites continually and complete repairs 
in a timely manner. They use a work order process to ensure an efficient, prioritized repair process. The district maintenanc
e staff has indicated that 
100% of all toilets on school grounds are in working order.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by 
the Office of Public School Construction.

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (Scho
ol Year 2019
-

It is our parent/caregiver volunteers who make our school a welcoming and caring community. Our active parent groups include 
PTA, SSC (School Site 
Council), ELAC (English Learner Advisory Committee) and Parents of Children of  African Desc
ent (PCAD).  Our Office of Family Engagement and Equity 
Specialist engages families, parent groups, school staff and the community to build partnerships that support student learnin
g. Some volunteer 
opportunities include reading with our primary age studen
ts in the classroom, attending and chaperoning field trips, coordinating fund
-
raisers and 
participating in our SSC. Our parents/caregivers help keep our environment clean and have been instrumental in completing our
 
school Safety Plan. They 
use their exper
tise to write grants to purchase materials, and  present science
-
based classroom demonstrations and art projects. It is the ideas and energy 
of our parents and caregivers that help fund school enrichment activities, such as our Literacy Nights, field trips
 
for all grade levels, and various 
celebrations honoring Latino, African
-
American and Asian heritage. Our families invest time and resources in our school that provide our students with 
a comprehensive, memorable and engaging education. At Sylvia Mendez we
 
believe that all members of our community are learners, and involve 
parents/caregivers by providing Adult Education classes. We are the first elementary school to pride itself in providing Span
ish classes for Adults to ensure 
that all families are full pa
rtners in the education of our children.  Please feel free to contact our Office of Family Engagement and Equity Specialist L

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is our 
primary concern. A variety of people visit the campus to volunteer in the classroom and participate in school 
events. During lunch, recesses, and before
-
and
-
after school, staff members supervise students and school grounds to ensure an orderly, safe 
enviro
nment. The school is always fully compliant with all rules, laws, and regulations concerning state earthquake standards and h
azardous materials. 
Earthquake and fire drills are held monthly, and intruder drills are held at least once a year.
 
 
Safety procedu
res, including elements of our Comprehensive Safe School Plan, are reviewed with school and district staff at the start of ea
ch school year. 
The plan was last updated and reviewed with school staff in winter of 2020.
