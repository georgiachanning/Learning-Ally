By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
El Tejon School was built in 1939. A clean, safe, and 
orderly environment for all students and staff is a priority at El Tejon 
School. Fifteen classrooms are utilized by students on the campus, including a computer lab, cafeteria, and gymnasium.
 
The District maintenance staff and site custodians maintain the 
campus, buildings, and grounds. To maintain a safe and 
healthy environment, all custodians and maintenance staff receive training in general maintenance procedures, handling 
hazardous materials, safety procedures, playground equipment safety checks, and wo
rk safety issues.
 
 
The custodial/maintenance staff consists of 3 part
-
time custodians, one part
-
time groundskeeper, and one part
-
time 
maintenance worker, whose hours are staggered throughout the school day as well as before and after school hours. 
Some of t
he custodians are also part
-
time bus drivers for the school district.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure
 
service and emergency repairs are given the highest 
priority. The MOT works with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules that ensure a clean and safe school.
 
Most recently, two outdoor basketball courts were added and a softball diamond was buil
t onto the campus with the 
support of the community in conjunction with the district. Our MOT department continues to make improvements on our 
grounds, such as maintaining the blacktop and trimming potentially hazardous trees.
 
 
Student safety on campus is v
itally important. There is always staff supervision on the playground 20 minutes before 
school begins in the morning, during all recesses, and in the cafeteria at lunchtime. Staff supervision of bus loading and 
unloading before and after school is always p
rovided.
 
 
During the summer of 2019, portable buildings were removed expanding the student play yard. The entire roof has been 
replaced with tin roofing.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parent 
Involvement is essential to overall student success at El Tejon School. Efforts to increase parent involvement are 
taking place through multiple opportunities for parents to connect with the school. In addition to school
-
sponsored 
events, El Tejon is incre
asing school
-
based sports events and academic challenges. Currently, we have an active PTSO 
(parent organization) that provides assistance with fundraising efforts and encouraging parents to assist teachers in 
school. Parents are encouraged to support El T
ejon School in the following ways; Graduation Committee, School Site 
Council, English Language Advisory Committee, Yearbook Staff, Associated Student Body, and Safe School Ambassadors. 
Various school events are offered throughout the year, for example; Bac
k to School Night, Open House, Quarterly Awards 
Assemblies, Father/Daughter Banquet, Science Fairs, Spring Carnival and Parent/Teacher Conferences. The Illuminate 
student data system allows access for parents to check grades and monitor student progress. Q
uarterly newsletters are 
sent home with valuable information on events and tips on how to assist students. Our Upcoming Events Calendar reports 
activities for parents and is made available in English and Spanish. El Tejon's athletic program is extremely su
ccessful which 
encourages parents to participate in extra
-
curricular events as coaches and helpers. Mrs. Hansen holds a monthly Coffee 
and Donuts with the Principal program.  This informal monthly gathering encourages parents to come to school to learn 
mor
e about what's taking place and also to voice concerns.  For more information on any of these programs, please contact

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Students and staff participate in regularly scheduled fire, disaster training, and lockdown drills. The Kern County Fire 
Department assesses the adequacy of emergency 
procedures and conducts yearly school safety inspections, all in 
accordance with a comprehensive School Safety Plan developed by a committee of staff and community members, which 
is updated annually. Additionally, El Tejon School and all schools in the El 
Tejon Unified School District now participate in 

 
 
Included in the School Safety Plan is a specific Emergency Plan that addresses emergency preparedness, and is in 
compliance with California Standard
ized Emergency Management Systems (SEMS). This plan was developed in 
cooperation with local officials and includes specific courses of action to be taken in case of an emergency. Emergency 
supplies are kept in each classroom, and school
-
wide emergency supp
lies are also maintained in a shipping container on 
campus. These plans can be found in the school office at El Tejon School, in each classroom on campus, online at 
www.eltejon.org, and also at the school district office. All plans were last reviewed and u
pdated in October 2019.
 
 
On a daily basis, yard and cafeteria supervision is provided by both classified and certificated personnel. Doors are locked 
at all times for increased security measures.  All visitors must report to the school office to obtain visi
tor passes.  Last year 
we implemented a Hall Pass System, which requires students to sign in and out and use hall passes when leaving or 
entering a classroom. This and other safety procedures have been very successful. This is one of several safety measure
s 
to ensure that students are accounted for at all times. Additional measures are considered during a debriefing each time 

our effor
ts to be prepared in any type of emergency.

Training and curriculum development revolves around the California Common Core Standards and frameworks, student 
and school safety and cu
lture, and is focused on student and teacher needs. The school has a 2

hour Professional 
Development course/meeting for teachers and staff to attend. This course is scheduled during multiple 2
-
hour intervals 
during ten separate partial days, and the variou

Administrators have trained in the use of Impact Teams in Professional Learning Co
mmunities and will guide teachers in 
working collaboratively on data analysis, improving student achievement, pacing calendars and common core grade

8th grade This is our 4th year of using 
Illuminate, student data system, that has helped us in multiple ways; not just specific demographic data, it also provides 
us an o
pportunity to gather group and individual assessment data.
 
 
The El Tejon Unified School District supports the efforts of all teachers

new and veteran

to gain the experience, 
knowledge, and skills to be effective leaders in the classroom through a 
range of programs. Formative Assessment for 
California Teachers (FACT), a State
-
sponsored program, is designed for first and second year credentialed teachers and 
provides skills assistance and reflective practices that are implemented over a two
-
year peri
od. All staff members

 
both 
certificated and classified

are encouraged to attend professional workshops and conferences.
 
 
Opportunities for observations of best practices are promoted within the District, and at school sites outside of the Distric
t 
that ar
e demonstrating success in closing the achievement gap for all students. New teachers, experienced teachers, 
teacher leaders, administrators, and support staff are encouraged to participate in workshops sponsored by the Kern 
County Superintendent of School
s Office, as well as continuing education opportunities offered through local colleges and 
universities.
 
 
New teachers and interns are provided a Mentor Teacher to assist them throughout the school year. The site Mentor 
provides much
-
needed support and coa
ching with instructional strategies, planning, and classroom management. Two 
teachers and one administrator attended restorative practices training during the summer. As the school year began a full 
day of restorative practices was provided to all teachers
. Four follow up sessions have been scheduled throughout the 
year to address teacher and student needs as they arise. furthermore, two teachers received training in Safe School 
Ambassadors, which uses specific practices to encourage student self
-
regulation
 
and develops a strong supportive culture. 
Teachers then trained support staff as well as 65 students. Training through Community Matters and Safe School 
Ambassadors was offered in a one day setting to all members of the staff and student body. Fourth

grad
e students and 
teachers were also included in the program.
