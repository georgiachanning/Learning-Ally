By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
San Marino is an elementary school that provides services to students from very diverse ba
ckgrounds in grades preschool 
through sixth, including four Special Day Classes (SDC). The San Marino School attendance area covers portions of Buena 
Park, Anaheim, and Cypress.   The school staff is committed to providing an exemplary school experience to
 
each of its 
students. Students at San Marino come from socio
-
economically diverse homes.  The school's enrollment is approximately 
553 students with 19 regular education classrooms in grades PS
-
6 and three Special Day Classes serving students from 
prescho
ol to sixth grade.  A total of 24 highly qualified certificated staff with CLAD certificates and 8 classified staff provide 
a comprehensive instructional program and related support services.  The Centralia School District provides centralized 
funding for 
textbooks, Special Education, GATE, and English Learners programs.  District funds employ a principal, an office 
manager, a part time health clerk, a full time Speech Teacher, a part time school psychologist, a full time special education
 
resource teacher,
 
a child development coordinator for child care, and a day and night custodian.
 
 
San Marino is a school where academic achievement and student conduct is the yardstick by which success is measured.  
We use data to drive our academic decisions with a focus 
on reading, math, writing and character development.  Teachers 
work collaboratively to ensure the success for all students.  They engage students in learning by making the curriculum 
rigorous and relevant by providing high quality grade level instruction. 
 
San Marino School prides itself on data driven 
decision making by providing early intervention, small reading group instruction based on assessment data from a variety 
of sources both formal and informal. A Media Center/Computer Lab and Reading Learning C
enter provide additional 
educational opportunities for our students.  Recently, the school has added an Innovation Lab. The Innovation Lab 
provides an additional space to create a 21st learning environment that allows our students to apply skills and conce
pts 
in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (S.T.E.A.M).
 
 
San Marino School, in partnership with the community, is dedicated to producing self
-
directed lifelong learners who 
master academic skills through a comprehensive curriculum which
 
challenges the learner's creative ideas, talents and 
interests in an environment of cooperative spirit, positive attitude and mutual respect. San Marino is committed to 
meeting the needs of all students through explicit direct instruction including differ
entiated instruction.  Students are 
provided a comprehensive curriculum in language arts, mathematics, history/social science, science, physical education, 
and health education. Many specialized programs including English Learner (EL), Gifted and Talented 
Education (GATE), 
Speech and Language, Special Education, Early Intervention Program, and the school's Response to Intervention program 
provides extra support to students.
 
 
With input from the School Site Council, ELAC, PTA,  and Teacher Leadership Team, t
he school continues to implement 
the district's model for a comprehensive school that focuses on measurable objectives that capture student achievement 
while building on an analysis of previous year's data.  Our curriculum and instructional focus for the n
ext few years will be 
directed toward the implementation of 21st Century learning to help our students become college and career ready 
through increased skills in critical thinking and problem solving, communication, collaboration, creativity and innovatio
n 
while building character and citizenship.
 
 
Mission and Vision Statement
 
Our mission is to encourage, inspire, and support students as they develop the skills to be self
-
directed, life
-
long learners 
and contributing members of the community within an 
atmosphere of respect and integrity.

AVID Elementary's mission is to close the achievement gap and prepare students for college and career. The beauty of 
AVID Elementary is that it is not exclusive. All students take part because the school has become an AVID school
. At San 
Marino we want to be that school that not only provides opportunity and access for all students to be successful but also 
closes the achievement gap while preparing students with the right footing to be successful for today and beyond. AVID 
Elemen
tary focuses on four necessary areas to ensure that all students are poised for academic success: Instruction, 
Culture, Leadership, and Systems to impact school wide structures. AVID Elementary takes a systematic approach using 
Writing, Inquiry, Collaborat
ion, Organization, and Reading strategies (WICOR) into daily instruction. AVID focuses explicitly 
on high expectations, rigor, and developing culture of college readiness, which is what, our California Common Core 
standards/NGSS focus on. AVID is what we d
o every day. It is a system of articulation between grade levels of best practices 
that are embedded in and throughout the entire year. It teaches students to make goals, take notes, be collaborative and 
that they have a path to college and career. It is i

Classroom Instruction that Works. AVID has proven time and time again that, when given a system of rigorous curriculum 
and strategic support, students can be academically successful.
 
 
AVID 
culture is prevalent both outside and inside the classrooms. This includes posting flags from various universities 
throughout the campus, wearing university shirts on Fridays, banners announcing that San Marino is an AVID school, and 
a morning chant. Withi

different colleges, Growth Mindset projects, multiple examples of students using academic language and collaboration, 
and every student has an organized binder. A
ll students also attend a field trip to a local college or university where they 
are able to see what college is like this includes are Kinder students who attend KinderCaminata at Cypress College. San 
Marino is AVID STRONG, AVID MINDED, and COLLEGE BOUND!
 
Goooooo RAMS!!!

In 2011, the Governor and State Legislature extended the suspension of State Board of Education (SBE) adoptions of 
instructional materials until the 2015

16 school year (Education Code Section 60200.
7).  At this time the State has adopted 
frameworks for English Language Arts/ English Language Development, and math which will assist in our implementation 
of  California's Common Core State Standards. We are currently piloting  State Board of Education a
dopted (January, 2014) 
instructional materials for math to reflect the rigor of the California's Common Core State Standards, teachers are 
developing curricula units, and various resources are provided as additional instructional materials. The State Board

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priori
ty: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Centralia School District welcomes and values parental involvement in District and school programs. During the 2018
-
2019 school year, CESD continued the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP). This funding process requires school 
districts to engage 
parents, teacher, employee groups, and the wider community to be a part of the development of the 
LCAP. Informational meetings were held with various stakeholders including Board members, parents, PTAs, and advisory 
groups (SSC, ELAC, DELAC, GATE, etc.). A
n LCAP committee was formed that included representatives from each 
stakeholder group. The LCAP represents an opportunity to further strengthen the commitments between our District and 
our community on behalf of all students. 
 
 
San Marino welcomes and valu
es parental involvement in the district and school site programs and committees. Parent 
involvement fosters better classroom behavior. Parents who participate in decision making experience have a greater 
feeling of ownership and are committed to supporting
 

school attendance and increases the chance of the students' educational success. San Marino parent engagement program 
enhances both instruction and special events. Many parents regularly volunte
er on PTA, School Site council (SSC). English 
Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), and in classrooms. Parents participate in our strategic planning process in many 
ways, through their involvement in SSC, GATE, ELAC and DELAC advisory groups. These groups me
et on a regular basis to 
share information, discuss school programs, evaluate performance data and provide input toward school
-
 
based decision 
making. The SSC/ELAC combined committee oversees the development and implementation of the School Plan for Studen
t 
Achievement (SPSA) and holds the final approval for he Safe School Action Plan. The district GATE parent meetings inform 
parents of our Gifted and Talented program and assist parents in supporting their students' specialized learning needs. 
Parents are i
nvolved in the writing of their child's Individualized GATE plan (IGP). Award Assemblies are held monthly and 
at the end of the trimester to recognize students' academic and behavior achievement where parents are invited.
 
 
Parents are encouraged to become 
active participants in their children's education by participating in a wide variety of 
activities. Some of our many opportunities for parents to get involved include: District English Language Advisory 
Committee, District GATE Advisory Committee, School S
ite Council, English Language Advisory Committee, PTA, Family 
Nights, Parent/ Child Events, Book Fair, and much more. The PTA is very active and benefits the school and students by 
encouraging and organizing parent involvement, promoting student achievemen
t, self
-
esteem and enriching the 
educational program through a variety of special programs, activities and services. PTA supports student learning by 
funding assemblies, study trips, art and music programs, and book sales. PTA supports community events suc
h as Harvest 
Carnival and Family Nights. Opportunities for parent education and family involvement occur regularly throughout the 
school year by the Community Liaison, Neighborhood Resource Center, and outside resources. Parent information 
meetings are con
ducted by the principal during Principal Coffee Chats and the principal gives a Principal's report at 
monthly PTA meetings. San Marino School believes that parents are an integral part of our students' education and success 
and that together we enhance the
 
possibilities for our students. San Marino School makes an effort to involve parents 
with a wide range of opportunities to interact with the school staff and support their child's academic efforts.

Centralia School District has developed a Disaster Plan for emergencies.  Staff members are in
-
serviced and assigned 
responsibilities for plan implementation.  The school and District participate in the annual California Shake Out earthquake 
drill each October.  The District also provided a district
-
wide Active Shooter training in collaboration with the Buena Park 
Police
 
Department with a follow up training in December.  Fire evacuation drills are held monthly.  The school maintains 
a Safety Committee and it meets minimally four times a year to review safety issues, plan staff development and makes 
recommendations for imp
rovement.
 
 
The plan provides students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes 
the following requirements of SB 187 within their safe school plans: current status of school crime; child abuse reporting 
pro
cedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsion; notification to 
teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and 
school employees; 
safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.  Annually, the school evaluates 
and updates the plan. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Plan, are reviewed with school and District 
staff in the fall, at the start
 
of each school year.
 
 
San Marino implements Positive Behavior and Intervention Support, a school
-
wide positive discipline plan that 
communicates high expectations for student behavior. Each student receives training on behavior expectations twice a 
year. 
At the beginning of the school year or upon entrance into the school, parents are provided with a detail description 
of the program. A School
-
Wide Positive Behavior Intervention System (PBIS) program has long been established at San 
Marino. The program foc
uses on the RAMS attributes (Respectful, Act Kindly, Make Responsible Choices, and Safety 
Minded) and the 7 B's 
-
  
Be on time, Be dressed for success, Be respectful, Be responsible, Be safe, Be prepared to learn, 
and Be scholarly. Teachers teach, monitor, 
enforce and exhibit these attributes throughout the year. This program has 
tremendous staff and parent support, and focuses on reinforcing positive behavior and teaching appropriate behavior 
along with social skills and character education while building a
 
safe clean environment for students and staff.  Additional 
support from school personnel and programs include Second Step Social Skills program, and a small group Zones program 
for students providing daily weekly positive reinforcements. Additional positi
ve reinforcement is provided weekly for all 
students through Rewards Recess and a once a month Monday Fun Day.The school follows all District Board Policies 
including those pertaining to Safety, Suspension, Expulsion and Mandatory Expulsion and Sexual Hara
ssment.
 
 
The Centralia School District Board of Trustees reviews the School Safety Action Plan annually by March 1.
