By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Las Juntas Elementary School earned the prestigious Californ
ia Gold Ribbon Award and the Title 1 Academic Achievement  
Award. Our school is located at the northern end of Martinez, California near established neighborhoods and light 
industry. It was dedicated in 1956 and is one of four elementary schools in the Mar
tinez Unified School District serving 
approximately 350 Transitional
-
 
Kindergarten through fifth grade students. The class ratio is 24:1 in all K
-
3 classrooms.  
Las Juntas was renovated in the summer of 2013 adding an upgraded food service/kitchen, cafeter
ia, parking lot, solar, 
playground, pedestrian walkways and landscaping. In the summer of 2018, Las Juntas a complete renovation of the grass 
field and track was completed including the addition of a par course. The instructional program at Las Juntas is d
riven by 
the Common Core State Standards, district goals, as well as 21st century learning standards. Our accountability system 
includes the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) in addition to district adopted curriculum and assessments 
to determi

 
 
Technology is used daily as a tool in our blended learning environment at Las Juntas. All of our teachers have a teacher 
iPad/laptop and document cameras to access with their class SmartBoard. In additi
on to our computer lab, students in  
3rd
-
5th have individual Chromebooks which they use on a daily basis. Our TK
-
2nd grade and Intervention classrooms each 
have 8
-
12 iPads  which are used daily across the curriculum. Our students utilize google docs, Haiku
, WIKI, Student Blogs, 
Coding, iMovie, Prezi, Powerpoint and a variety of Apps for publishing, recording student solutions/work, reading, math, 
etc. We have the LJE S.T.E.A.M.(Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics) Lab which opened in Decembe
r 



 
creativity, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration.  Teachers are able to use the S.T.E.A.M. Lab to work 
with stud
ents on a variety of challenges and activities including robotics, circuits, coding, building kits,etc.
 
 
Most of our classroom teachers are certified through a 6 day training in Project GLAD (Guided Language Acquisition 
Design). The Project GLAD strategies
 
are used during instruction to support all students.  Project GLAD is a researched 
based method of differentiated instruction that helps promote the learning of academic language alongside practice of 
speaking, reading, and writing all through academic co
ntent curriculum.  Project GLAD was selected because it has been 
proven to increase academic success and provide significant supports to all students especially English Language Learners, 
special education students and GATE students.
 
 
To help ensure high l
evels of learning for all students, interventions are developed and offered to students who are 
experiencing difficulty reaching standards. Our staff uses the "Response to Intervention" (RTI) model to monitor student 
learning and progress. Our intervention
s can include Tier 1 classroom based interventions, Tier 2 small group specialized 
academic instruction, in math and reading, with an intervention teacher and a para
-
educator in groups (Resource and 
Targeted Time Intervention *TTI) or Special Education ser
vices as appropriate for qualifying students.
 
 
Las Juntas Elementary school is a wonderful educational haven for all students and members of our community. Members 
of this educational community have a rich tradition of supporting the efforts of a school th
at serves all members of the 
community. Students of Las Juntas have access to Solution
-
Focused School Counselors four days a week to assist with 
social skills, peacemakers and any social/emotional issues that may prevent a child from their highest level of
 
academic 
success. We also offer tutoring for students of Native American heritage through the county's Indian Education Program.

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Las Juntas staff monitors school grounds thirty minutes prior to the start of school. Staff members also supervise 
students who are driven home after school by walking each child to his/her car in the loading zone in front of th
e school. 
A crossing guard is employed to help children cross Pacheco Boulevard/Camino del Sol and at Arthur Rd/Karen Ln.
 
 
Monthly fire drills and Shelter In Place drills are conducted to reinforce both staff and student procedures. Earthquake 
and 
intruder/lock
-
down drills are held twice a year. Shell Oil has provided each classroom with an emergency 
preparedness barrels consisting of emergency materials and supplies. Our site emergency plan is updated, reviewed and 
approved by the Site Council and 
MUSD School Board annually.
 
 
Classrooms and the office are connected by telephone. All staff members use hand held radios for yard supervision and 
after school car duty in case an emergency arises and they need to communicate quickly with the office. They 
are also 
used during all emergency drills so we can better communicate with our staff.
 
 
Our  District Safety Plan and School Safety Plan are one hundred percent compliant with the National Emergency 
Management System. It was approved by the board in Januar
y 2018.
 
 
Date of Last Review/Update: August 2019

Martinez Unified professional development focus for the past eight years has been to transform classroom practice to 
meet the demands of college and 
career readiness. Content emphasis has been on the implementation of the Common 
Core State Standards (CCSS), the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), and the use of technology to transform and 
enhance instruction. Though each individual school site va
ries in its particular needs around these areas, as a district the 
vision for Professional Development is consistent among all schools. As the focus has shifted from the transition to the 
CCSS to the implementation of the instructional rigor needed to full
y address the standards, Professional Learning has had 
to shift as well. In the past few years, MUSD has emphasized the changes required of educators around key focus areas: 
mindset, intentionality, instruction, and access.
 
 
Professional Development is for
mally provided to all teachers two full
-
days a year; one day in August and one in January. 
In addition to the full
-
day training provided, three half
-
day PD release times are provided to our teaching staff. This year 
these release times have been focused on
 
Writing Calibration across all elementary sites. We have also provided time to 
train teachers in our new IXL online skill
-
building platform. This supplemental program provides Tier I differentiated 
support and a customized learning plan for all K
-
5 studen
ts. Additional opportunities for individual and grade
-
level specific 
professional development in other content areas, i.e. EL learners, math, Universal Design for Learning, etc. are also 
provided based on teacher needs and site requests.

Beginning in 2017
-
18, and continuing through and into 2019
-
20, professional development at the elementary level has 
been focused on the implementation and extension (with the recent addition of a K
-
2 Phonics Program) of Readers and 
Writer's Workshop.  To support implementa
tion and student learning, MUSD has brought in consultants who are expertly 

in varying ways over the past three years. Each year profess
ional development has been designed to support teacher and 
student growth, as well as rigor within this program. Training includes "demo days" where the coaches plan and model 
instruction with teachers and then, in turn, teachers practice in front of the c
oaches.  The coaches have also spent time 
with principals discussing the elements of the workshop model, what to look for when conducting classroom observations, 
and how to give feedback to teachers within the workshop.  This has built the capacity of our 
teachers and principals to 
sustain the implementation of high
-
quality instruction within our Balanced Literacy block.  In addition, the coaches work 
with Reading and Writing Support Teachers from each site to provide additional training.  The Support Teach
ers (primary 
and upper elementary teachers from each site, up to four teachers per site) meet five times a year with the coaches, as 
well as provide training and support for colleagues at their respective school sites via staff meetings, grade
-
level traini
ng, 
and 1:1 support.
 
 
 
Our staff participates in site and district professional development days throughout the school year. Each Monday, 
Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday our instructional hours have been increased to allow for us to release our students earl
y 
on Wednesdays.  After students are released on Wednesdays, our staff participates in grade level collaboration time and 
staff professional development. Professional Development days are delivered by both district and outside agencies or 
presenters.
 
 
The 
following represents our current and recent past professional development topics:
 
*Common Core professional development delivered through district wide/site professional development
 
*Adoption of Reader's Workshop Curriculum
-
 
Lucy Calkins/ Units of Study
 
*B

planning/implementation of strategies)
 
 
In addition to the topics listed above, some teachers have also participated in training based on:
 
*Interactive SMARTBoard technology, 
Chromebooks, Google Apps for Education and IPAD Training
 
* Readers Workshop: staff  professional development, release time for demo lessons with feedback for growth
 
*Daily 5/Literacy Cafe: Reading strategies for increasing comprehension, fluency, vocabular
