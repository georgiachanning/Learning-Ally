Mission Statement:
 
Valentine 
Peyton School provides an instructional program that reflects high expectations for all students and 
focuses on mastery of the standards.
 
 
Vision: By focusing on a rigorous and challenging curriculum, we aspire for our students to become literate, 
critical
 
thinkers, effective communicators, and life
-
long learners.
 
 
School Profile:
 
The focus of Peyton School is the social and academic success of our students; preparing them for college, 
career and community. Our staff members believe in continuous improvemen
t. We educate children with 
both enthusiasm and genuine concern for making a difference, not only on our campus, but in the world.
 
 
We are proud that our students have shown tremendous growth. Though this growth is definitely something 
to celebrate, it is 
only one of the celebrations of our great school. We believe that all students, families, staff 
and community members should feel welcome and know their importance. This atmosphere is critical to the 
emotional well
-
being of our students, which in turn, hel
ps the students be academically successful. Innovative 
programs such as PLUS (Peer Leaders Uniting Students), Student Leadership, Project Lead the Way, and AVID 
provide opportunities for students and families to support our children as they grow as scholar
s and as citizens.
 
 
Evidence of academic growth can be seen not only in our iReady and SBAC data, but also in reclassification 
rates of English Learners and ELPAC scores. Student performance is monitored through careful analysis of 
student progress toward 
benchmarks at teacher academic conferences led by specialists and administrators, 
as well as student academic conferences. Specialists support teachers in the areas of Reading, English 
Language Development, Mathematics, Speech, and Resource for Special Edu
cation students. Teacher 
professional growth is also highly regarded at Peyton School. Our teachers are actively involved in 
collaboration, professional development, and are known for being instructional leaders in the district.
 
 
We have four special day c
lasses on our campus, including three levels of Autism classes that serve students 
in grades K
-
8. These students enrich our campus and help all students to respect others, regardless of physical 
or learning challenges. Many of our students are mainstreamed
 
into general education classes.  Students in 
general education and special education settings share play time and are often paired for class projects to 
encourage socialization and inclusion.  We also have Reading Buddies and older students that pair up w
ith 
younger students to complete an activity or teach them how to use technology.
 
 
School Poem:
 
There is nothing like a neighborhood school when it's working at its potential.  Its power is breathtaking.  Its 
potential is unlimited.  It empowers the knowle
dge and wisdom of caring adults to motivate and encourage a 
lifetime of learning for all who enter its gates.  It provides community, character, and refuge from what is 
broken outside its walls.  It builds bridges to knowledge seekers and offers truth and 
cognitive stimulation to 
those it serves.  It provides resources for those in need, opens its arms to the forgotten, and challenges each 
person to go beyond their experiences and imagination.  It breaks the chains of ignorance, frees the hopeless, 
offers b
elonging to the marginalized of this world, and celebrates the empowerment of the success in learning 
and rigorous challenge.  Whatever the capacity for human ignorance, the school community has a greater 
capacity for educating and promoting citizenship to
 
change this city.  This is what we do.  This is who we are.  
This is Peyton School.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes fo
r all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This
 
information is far more meaningful when along with 

mes of the textbooks used 
in our core classes and their dates of publication.

School Facility Conditions and Plan
ned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Peyton School opened a beautiful new campus in the Riverbend area in 2009. The school site has a kindergarten building with i
ndividual classroom 
restrooms and a separate playground and teacher workroom. There is a large 
two story classroom building, which houses first through eighth grade 
classes, as well as a staff lounge and workroom. Our resource building includes a library, a state of the art computer lab, a
 
life skills special education 
classroom, the counseling offi
ce, and the resource classroom. The multipurpose building contains a full cooking kitchen, a Physical Education room and 
an indoor stage. The administration building has one special education classroom, a staff lounge, a conference room, and a la
rge commun
ity room used 
for large gatherings and assemblies. Our preschool cottage has a separate and secure playground for the two classes on campus
. The students enjoy a 
blacktop with many activities, a playground apparatus, and a large field area.
 
 
District maint
enance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good condition and working order are completed in a tim
ely manner. 
A work order process is used to maintain efficient service and make sure emergency repairs are given the highest priori
ty.
 
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that all classrooms, restrooms, and facilities are 
well
-
maintained and in good 
repair. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to produc
e a clean and safe school.
 
 
Stockton Unified takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, we
 
utilize the facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California OPSC. The full report is a
vailable upon request.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the foll
owing information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for studen
ts in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administrati
on of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfull
y completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

School Safety Plan
 

dial team e
nsures the 
school facilities are in compliance with all health and safety regulations. Our facilities are cleaned daily to maintain a he
althy environment. During each 
vacation break, a deep cleaning process occurs during the close of school. A site review 
with the district Internal Evaluation Instrument (IEI) occurs 
annually.
 
 

diness and Emergency 
Management Plan identifies procedures
 
to follow during emergencies and natural disasters. The REMS plan is reviewed, updated, and discussed with the 
faculty at the start of each school year and revisited throughout the school year. The updated REMS plan was reviewed with th
e faculty on July 3
1, 2019 
and with parents and students on August 1, 2019.  Fire Drills are conducted with all staff and students on a monthly basis, w
ith other emergency drills 
each trimester. In the event of a school emergency, the administrator activates the Emergency Re
sponse Team, including notification of the appropriate 
site and district personnel, to resolve the emergency and safely secure or evacuate the students, based upon the site and dis
trict Readiness and 
Emergency Management for Schools (REMS) plan. Parents ar
e contacted in a timely manner through a mass notification system to inform them of any 
important safety announcements. Our site also utilizes Share911, a web
-
based program which enables all district and site staff to communicate and 
coordinate with each o
ther during emergency situations.
 
 
Every effort is made to ensure students are monitored while on campus throughout the school day. The campus is locked and sec
ure during school hours. 
All visitors must sign in at the office, receive proper authorization t
o be on campus, and must display their passes at all times. Peyton School ensures that 
our playgrounds are safe for all students. We have two full time Campus Safety Assistants and six part time noon duty supervi
sors, as well as two full 
time and one part 
time administrator, to provide supervision before school, at recesses, and after school. Teachers also provide additional sup
ervision 
during recesses and after school dismissal.
 
 
Peyton School has a strong Positive Behavior Intervention System (PBIS) in 
place to support student knowledge of the expectations of every area in the 
school.  Student behavior is reinforced by a consistent incentive plan, as well as consequences when needed.
