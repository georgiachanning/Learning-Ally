Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
La Viña Middle School is newly built and was first occupied in August of 2
006. Buildings include a total of 34 permanent 
classrooms of which 28 are occupied. Facilities also include a band/choir room, a multi
-
purpose room, a library/media 
room, administration building, a gymnasium, a physical fitness lab, and two science labs. A
ll buildings are in excellent 
condition, are exceptionally modern, and are cleaned daily. Our students are able to enjoy outdoor activities on our 
spacious soccer/football field, and numerous basketball courts are also available. Before school, students ar
e supervised 
in a central area by the Campus Supervisor, Vice
-
Principal, and noon duty aides. In addition to the Campus Supervisor, the 
Vice
-
Principal  and teachers follow a yard duty schedule to help supervise the student break area. Our lunch supervision
 
includes a Campus Supervisor, the Vice Principal, an Academic/Behavior Intervention Teacher, and five noon duty aides. 
Once school begins, access to school grounds is limited through the office.  The school office includes a secured door that 
requires all
 
visitors be buzzed in, and all persons requesting access to the campus beyond the front office are required to 
scan their Driver's License/valid ID/Military ID, etc using our "Raptor System".  Our Campus Supervisor patrols the 
perimeter and grounds throug
hout the day to ensure student safety and verifies facilities are clean and free of hazards. 
Administration and teachers are also present during after
-
school yard duty to assist with clearing the campus and serving 
as crosswalk crossing guards.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
