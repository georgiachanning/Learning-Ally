By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019

School Description
 
Danbrook Elementary School, located in West Anaheim, is one of eight scho
ols in the Centralia Elementary School District. 
Danbrook offers an exemplary educational program for students in Pre
-
Kinder through sixth grade.  Teachers and support 
staff at Danbrook Elementary believe that a strong academic focus supported by a positiv
e and caring learning 
environment is essential to the success of our students.
 
 
A strong emphasis is placed on providing a safe, attractive environment for our students and staff.  Equally important is 
the emphasis on developing strong positive character t
raits through our Positive Behavior Intervention System (PBIS) 
program which focuses on instructing students in the core school values, positive attitude, respect for self and others, 
integrity, dependability and excellence. This program has tremendous sta
ff and parent support. Referrals to the principal's 
office for serious offenses are rare and suspensions virtually non
-
existent. Our Visual and Performing Arts Academy 
provides students with an array of fine arts classes including, Violins, Art, Dance, Fas
hion Design and Video Production.  
Every student from 4th through 6th grade takes piano class in our recently renovated music room. This will ensure that in 
two years and thereafter every student that promotes from Danbrook will know how to read and play m
usic. After the 
school day we provide a robust after school reading and math intervention program.  The Club CASA program through 
ASES provides students with tutoring, homework assistance and enrichment activities. Students can also join the Anaheim 
PD's J
unior Cadets or a sports club.
 
 
Danbrook School has been the recipient the following achievements in the past few years:

School Mission and Vision
 
Danbrook School is center of the community where children learn academic and social skills that will help them to be 
successful adults and contributing citizens.  We will use the results
 
from a variety of academic and social assessments to 
guide the decision making for designing programs and services to meet these needs.  Students will take pride in their 
accomplishments as the school celebrates their successes.  Students will be taught h
ow to be successful through adult 
modeling, instructional lessons and practical experiences.  Parents will be assisted with individual and group services in 
the areas of parenting, health care, social services and learning English.  The atmosphere of the s
chool will be maintained 
to be attractive and well kept.  Teachers will work collaboratively to make the best decisions for program planning and 
instructional strategies.  Supplemental services will be provided as "interventions" to assist target students 
who are at risk 
in order to ensure each child's success.

In 2
011, the Governor and State Legislature extended the suspension of State Board of Education (SBE) adoptions of 
instructional materials until the 2015

16 school year (Education Code Section 60200.7).  At this time the State has adopted 
frameworks for Englis
h Language Arts/ English Language Development, and math which will assist in our implementation 
of  California's Common Core State Standards. We are currently piloting  State Board of Education adopted (January, 2014) 
instructional materials for math to re
flect the rigor of the California's Common Core State Standards, teachers are 
developing curricula units, and various resources are provided as additional instructional materials. The State Board of 
Education adopted ELA/ ELD instructional materials in Nov
ember 2015  which directed our pilot and adoption of new 
instructional materials.

The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The  Centralia School District 
welcomes and values parental involvement in District and school programs.     During the 
2013
-
14 school year, CESD began the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) process.   This new funding process requires 
school districts to engage parents, teacher, 
employee groups, and the wider community to be a part of the development 
of the LCAP.   Informational meetings were held with various stakeholders including Board members, parents, PTAs, and 
advisory groups (DELAC, GATE, PTA).   An LCAP committee was forme
d that included representatives from each 
stakeholder group. The culmination of the LCAP committee was the adoption of the 2014
-
15 LCAP on June 24, 2014 by 
the Board of Trustees.  The LCAP represents an opportunity to further strengthen the commitments bet
ween our District 
and our community on behalf all of students.
 
 
Parents at Danbrook Elementary School are an integral part of the students' education and success. Numerous 
opportunities are available to increase parental involvement by having parents atten
d school events, volunteer their time, 
and sharing in the decision
-
making process of the school.  Parents may  volunteer to assist classroom teachers and help 
with other school activities.   Centralia School makes an effort to involve parents with a wide r
ange of opportunities to

Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Danbrook Elementary. The School Site Action Plan was developed by 
the Site Safety Committee and the School Site Council with input from the School Safety team. The safety plan is reviewed 
and revised 
annually by all groups. New goals and tasks are added as necessary. The 2018
-
19 goals of our Safe School 
Action Plan include the following goals:
 
 
Goal #1: Danbrook school's climate shall reflect respect, tolerance and pride for diversity of culture, ethni
city, and 
philosophy.  It is a place where students demonstrate strong academic progress, follow school rules and develop 
responsibility for their learning and respect for themselves and their school.
 
 
Goal #2: Danbrook School's climate shall provide an em
otionally secure learning environment for all students.
 
 
Goal #3: Danbrook School shall provide a secure campus with careful monitoring and supervision of all areas to ensure 
student safety and adherence to the rules.
 
 
Goal #4: Danbrook School shall 
provide for the safety of students and staff through a well
-
planned and implemented crisis 
response plan.

Centralia School District has developed a Disaster Plan for emergencies.  Staff members are in
-
serviced and assigned 
responsibilities for plan implem
entation.  The school and District participate in the annual California Shake Out earthquake 
drill each October.   Active shooter training was conducted in August to the entire district staff with a follow up training 
in 
September.  All staff members are a
ware of the three levels of lockdowns and are able to identify evacuation locations.   
Fire evacuation drills are held monthly.  The school maintains a Safety Committee and it meets minimally four times a year 
to review safety issues, plan staff developmen
t and makes recommendations for improvement.
 
 
The plan provides students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes 
the following requirements of SB 187 within their safe school plans: current status of scho
ol crime; child abuse reporting 
procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsion; notification to 
teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupi
ls, parents, and 
school employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.  Annually, the school evaluates 
and updates the plan. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Plan, are reviewed with school and Distr
ict 
staff in the fall, at the start of each school year.
 
 
Danbrook has implemented an award winning Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) program.  Through this 
schoolwide program students earn Courteous, Aware, Responsible, Eager to Learn (C
ARE) cards or points.  Students 
exchange these cards for prizes or activities that can be found online at the PBIS store.  Among the most popular items is 
time with their favorite teacher or the principal.  The program also matches at risk students with a 
mentor staff member.  
Mentor
-
mentee actives are the highlights of students time at Danbrook.  At Tuesday morning assemblies students are 
recognized for being models of the CARE attributes.  By teaching and rewarding positive behaviors, students become 
part
ners in creating a safe learning environment for all.
 
 
The Centralia School District's Board of Trustees reviews the School Safety Action Plan annually by March 1.
