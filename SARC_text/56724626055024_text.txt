By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Haycox School is a multi
-
ethnic site serving a diverse population of approximately 960 stu
dents. We qualify for Schoolwide 
Title I funding through the Consolidated Application, with a significant amount of low
-
income students as determined by 
returned applications for free and reduced lunch. Eighty seven percent of Haycox students are English l
earners, while a 
significant number of students qualify for Migrant Education services. The school supports Special Education services as 
well as programs for Gifted and Talented (GATE) students. Haycox School receives categorical funding to support the 
le
arning of these students. In addition to a rigorous curriculum of daily instruction, all special needs, at
-
risk or academically 
deficient students receive supplemental instruction from certificated and classified personnel during and after school, as 
well 
as on select Saturdays.
 
 
The school is located in the southwest corner of the city of Oxnard and is one of eleven schools in the Hueneme Elementary 
School District, a K
-
8 district comprised of nine elementary and two junior high schools. The Haycox communi
ty is 
predominantly Hispanic, with a majority of the families living in the multiple family dwellings spread throughout the school 

Haycox h
as been a high poverty school with a high percentage of transiency among its students. Spanish is the primary 

speaking only Mixteco or a
 
combination of Mixteco and some Spanish. The staff and students are supported by the services 
of Mixteco interpreters.
 
 
Haycox School is a transitional kindergarten through fifth grade school. All TK and Kindergarten classes are on the extended 
day schedu
le. The primary grades concentrate on teaching core subjects using the California Common Core State 
Standards. The upper grades concentrate on further developing skills the students have learned and emphasize application 
of skills across the curriculum. Re
mediation and enrichment are provided as needed. Instruction in English language 
development is given to every student on a daily basis.  Daily instructional schedules are designed to maximize learning 
time for students.Classroom one to one devices are ava
ilable in all grades two through five, with a classroom set of 10 
iPads in Kinder and first grade. Additional STEM technology is available at each grade level with a school wide STEM 
program planned to support the development of student skills at each grad
e level.
 
 
Haycox is an AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) certified elementary school with AVID strategies being 
implemented in all 5th grade classrooms and the program is developing further in some 3rd and 4th grade classrooms.
 
 
Our mission i
s to inspire our students to explore, dream big, and develop social and civic responsibility through a balanced 
learning program. They will Thrive as we foster perseverance and resiliency in a safe, culturally responsive, and inclusive 
community. We will E
mpower our students by teaching them critical thinking skills through a rigorous academic 
experience in a digitally
-
rich environment.
 
 
We are a passionate and resilient community united by high expectations and serving all students.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priori
ty: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are an integral
 
component to student learning and Haycox encourages parent involvement. Written notes are 
sent to parents to inform them about school events in both English and Spanish. Parents are notified through the 
automated SMS text and voice message communication s
ystem for events, reminders and general information in English, 
Spanish and Mixteco. A monthly newsletter and calendar are accessible on the school website, as well as sent home to 
the students highlighting special events in the upcoming month.  We have pa
rent volunteers in the classroom.  Field trips 
always include parent participation. Often, there is standing room only at our back
-
to
-
school night and spring open house.  
Trimester assemblies recognize exemplary student behavior, academic proficiency, and 
improvement, and parents are 
invited to attend assemblies to watch their children being recognized. During the school day a Mixteco translator is at 
Haycox to assist parents. Parent conferences are held twice a year.
 
 
Triple P (Positive Parenting Program) 
classes are provided at Haycox School by our school counselors and Migrant parent 
meetings are also held at Haycox. Workshops and programs put on by teachers, administration, and organizations prepare 
parents to assist their children toward academic succes
s.Numerous other parent education sessions are conducted 
throughout the year, featuring such topics as school expectations, transitioning to junior high, homework support, reading 
support, nutrition, drug and gang awareness, family resilience, neighborhood
 
safety and community resources.  This year 
a family academy had been established to include Game Night, Literacy Night, Math Night, and STEAM Night. The intention 
of these events is to involve parents and students in activities which are academic and fun,
 
further enhancing parents 
confidence and willingness to become involved in their children's academic success.
 
 
Haycox has an elected School Site Council and English Language Advisory Committee that meets approximately six times 
each school year to discuss
 
school programs and budget. Haycox is represented on the District Advisory Committee, the 
District English Learner Advisory Committee, and the Gifted & Talented Education (GATE) Committee. Any parent who 
would like to become involved with Haycox School ca

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Haycox School Safety Plan is updated annually and was approved by the School Site Council and by the English 
Language Advisory Committee. It includes fire and 
earthquake drills, as well as evacuation and lock
-
down procedures. In 
the event of an emergency, staff members are briefed with specific duties and reporting locations. The plan was presented 
to the leadership and reviewed with staff.
 
 
Last summer the admi
nistrative offices were remodeled and the primary entrance to the school was updated to increase 
safety and security for students and staff.  A new anti
-
climb fence has been installed around the perimeter of the school.  
Also, in order to improve safety fo
r children on the playground, we have established a school
-
wide program creating 
specific areas for play activities separate form  walking and resting areas. This has helped to create a more calm 
atmosphere and a safer playground.
 
 
Safety matters are regul
arly discussed with Leadership and with the staff in order to review procedures and confirm 
understanding of expectations. For further security, all staff wear Haycox identification cards.  All visitors are required t
o 
sign in at the office and wear a visi
tor badge while on campus. Parents must sign students out if they are picked up early 

students. Teachers release students after school t
o known members of the family or babysitters as long as parents have 
provided authorization on the school emergency card. Students enter and leave the campus through only two exits, for 
safety reasons, with a staff member monitoring the transition at the b
eginning and end of the school day. All employees 
are asked to question or report anyone on campus who is not displaying proper identification.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and 
Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Administrators, teachers and paraprofessionals participate in professional development focused on the California 
Common Core State Standards in order to improve their skills in teaching and assessment of student learning. The 
primary 
focus areas are instruction of grade
-
level content standards, intervention strategies for students who have not mastered 
standards, and assessment of student progress. 
 
 
The primary area of focus for the most recent three
-
year period was:
 

 
English 
Language Arts
 

 
English Language Development
 

 
Writing
 

 
Mathematics
 

 
C.H.A.M.P.S. Program (Conversation, Help, Activity, Movement, Participation, Successful Students)
 
In addition, this year all Haycox teachers have participated in Foundational Skills professiona
l development to support 
students' acquisition of reading skills across all grade levels. We have also enhanced training in the area of Social Emotion
al 
Learning. 
 
 
Professional development is offered during the teaching day, on three student
-
free staff de
velopment days, during 
summer institutes, after school, and on weekends. Substitute teachers are provided and the negotiated hourly rate is 
offered for attendance.
 
 
During the school year, teachers are supported by classroom observations, staff meetings, a
nd grade
-
level/content area 
collaboration. Professional learning agendas are based on student achievement data and teacher input. In 
reading/language arts and mathematics, student performance data is ongoing and evaluated using a common assessment. 
A Stude
nt Progress Report aligned to the California Common Core State Standards is sent to parents at the end of each 
trimester.
