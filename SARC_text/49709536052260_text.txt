By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our vision is to be a healthy and literate community!
 
 

We are a Community School focusing on thr
ee major areas.
 

 
A strong core instructional program designed to help all students meet high academic standards;
 

 
Expanded learning opportunities designed to enrich the learning environment for students and their families;
 

 
A full range of health, 

-
being and remove 
barriers to learning
 
El Verano Community School has one unifying goal: to be the healthiest and most literate community in Sonoma County. 
Our programs work in support of
 
this goal for the children and adults within our community. 
 
 
We have evolved into a Community School model. We identify the strengths and assets within our community and then 
coordinate, and expand those resources.
 
 
Teachers collaborate to examine studen
t work and make instructional decisions based on evidence. We have created an 
after school program for parents and students. Including: Spanish, athletic club, ballet folklorico, leadership, reading, 
Zumba, yoga, basketball, support groups and English clas
ses. Parent leaders help to create and implement these programs. 
A Community School is a means to raise academic achievement, and support the social and emotional needs of our 
community. Three focus areas include: a strong core instructional program, expan
ded learning opportunities and a range 
of health, mental health and social services.
 
 
Our staff is proud of all of our achievements. El Verano focuses on teacher learning and practice in writing, science, art 
and language development. We believe this dedic
ation has contributed to student achievement. Teachers collaborate to 
develop strategies for instruction and assessments. We use our assessments to inform our instruction and set goals for 
student learning. We continue with our exciting programs to help in
crease student achievement and engagement. 
 
 
Our teachers are highly trained in Readers and Writers workshop which is a curriculum and also a strategy on how to best 
teach literacy. We use Visual Thinking Strategies. This program uses fine art as a method 
for developing critical thinking 
skills and language. Our preschool continues to provide our students with a great start to their educational career. We are 
very pleased to watch their progress as they learn and grow. The El Verano community is a very spec
ial one. Our parent 
participation and leadership continues to help support students, teachers and families. We encourage parent and 
community participation and our doors are always open!
 
 
Our strength is in our community!

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvemen
ts (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Our facilities are in great condition. The school is 60 plus years old, and its age has subtle effects on the campus. Several
 
years ago, our site underwent a maj
or renovation. As a result, classrooms have heating and air
-
conditioning, and we have 
a modern, well
-
designed library, and computer lab. We have replaced aging playground equipment and continue to 
upgrade our student play areas. We are currently upgrading 
our benches and painting much of our facility. Our parents 
have recently built several gardens to compliment our beautiful setting. We have several murals covering our walls that 
highlight our commitment to education, reading, history, science and art. Our
 
solar panels support our energy use. The 
parent community at El Verano takes great pride in caring for the campus. We have several gardens and visitors often 
comment on the beauty of our campus grounds. We have annual clean up days with families and commu
nities.

El Verano  collaborates with the Family Resource Center and Sonoma Valley Parent University to 
engage parents as active learners and provide opportunities for them to directly experience the same inquiry frame of 
mind that their children are exp

and vision. The Community School model supports our school and community members as well as offers an array of 
leadership opportunities.  We offer an array of classe
s for adults in the evening that range from ESL to Zumba.

Our school community fully supports a community vision for schools. El Verano is the hub of the El Verano Neighborhood. 
Families, students and community members have contributed to and benefit from
 
the services provided at El Verano. The 
school board recognizes that schools are more than academic institutions and acknowledges that serving the entire 
community is the future.  This program has the ownership and of the school and community at large. To
wn Hall meetings 
engage the community, student progress breeds pride and accomplishment, and parent leadership creates a sense of 
responsibility and achievement that is unprecedented. As a result of our work, we have community organizations asking 

 

 
 

Committee (ELAC) and a Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) that meet monthly. Our PTO and ELAC host myriad activities 
for El Ver
ano School. Through fund
-
raising efforts, the organization purchased and installed new kindergarten play 
equipment, funded a school wide art program, purchased new computers for our lab, lunch time sports program, holiday 
fair and spring book fair. Our par
ent organizations are exemplar in their commitment to supporting students and teachers.  
Parent University helps identify areas of interest to the greater school community and plays a vital role in the leadership 
and education at El Verano. Our Family Reso
urce Center helps families in crisis and as well as developing leadership 
opportunities for families. We encourage parents to call our PTO president, at (707) 996
-
6050 or our ELAC president at 
(707) 935
-

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Student safety is of the utmost concern to our staff. Staff and parent representatives jointly developed our school wide 
discipline and safety plan. We hold regular practice drills, as outlined in the plan. Each November our School Site Council 
(SSC) revie
ws and approves the plan, making any needed revisions. Teachers and classified personnel monitor the school 
grounds before, during, and after school.
 
 
All El Verano School staff members have received training in a curriculum that addresses safety and Posit
ive Behavior 
Intervention Support (PBIS). This program uses the concepts of peace paths and class councils to resolve conflicts. We 
continue with the Responsive Classroom to help support students socially by building a community of learners. Our 
students u
nderstand the consequences of choices and we use a positive behavior approach. We use logical consequences 
as our behavior system. Students receive Life Skill certificates for exemplifying life skills at school. Our families receive
 
a 
copy of our behavior 
policy and is sent home annually.
 
 
We recently opened a Mindfulness Center and hope to continue this model of support for students. We also have a menu 
of mental mental health and wellness services for families through our community partnerships.
