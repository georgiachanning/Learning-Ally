By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Strathmore Elementary School, which now houses TK to 4th grade, was originally constructed in 1937 with many additions 
and upgrades, and is currently 
comprised of 34 classrooms, a staff lounge, a cafeteria, an auditorium, a library, two 
computer labs and two playgrounds. Included in the classrooms is a dedicated music room/band room. One permanent 
classroom and 9 portables were removed in June 2011 and 
a new wing completed construction August 2012 which 
contains 10 permanent classrooms and one computer lab.  We just completed a modernization project which included 

 
 
Strathmore 
Middle School, which houses grades 5 to 8, was originally constructed in 1999 with an additional wing 
constructed in 2008. It currently is comprised of 20 classrooms, one staff lounge, one cafeteria/multipurpose room/gym 
with outdoor eating area, one libra
ry, and one computer lab. Classrooms include a science lab and a band room designed 
to house our 70 member band. We just completed an update to our office (including the lounge and staff meeting/training 
room) last year.
 
 
Strathmore Elementary School facil
ities are specifically designed and maintained to support an atmosphere that promotes 
excellence in teaching and learning.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair are made and work orders 
are complet
ed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest priority to 
emergency repairs.  The results of the most recent school facilities inspection during the Tulare County Williams 
Settlement review was GOOD in all cate
gories with an overall compliance of over 98%.  When reviewing the report it is 
important to note that even the minor cosmetic discrepancies are reported in the inspection process.
 
 
The District participated in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program
, until SBX34 discontinued the program. The 
district has elected to retain the designated funds to assist with expenditures for repair or replacement of existing school 
building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, electrical sy
stems, interior or exterior painting, 
repair of concrete, repair of wall and floor systems. For the 2018
-
2019 school year, the district did not allocate any 
additional funds to the deferred maintenance program as the current level is well established.

Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
This Comprehensive School Safety Plan for Strathmore Union 
Elementary School District is written in compliance with 
California Education Code, Title V Education, and Section 560, which requires all public schools to have a written disaster 
preparedness plan. This plan is reviewed annually, with the current plan ap
proved by the school board on August 12, 2019. 
Included in the plan are routine and emergency disaster response procedures. Employees of Strathmore Union Elementary 
School District become familiar with this plan so that they can carry out their responsibil
ities in an emergency. In addition 
to routine and emergency disaster procedures, the Comprehensive School Safety Plan provides information on other 
safety related policies and procedures including things like discipline, dress code, and school environment.
 
 
An integral part of this plan is the Classroom Emergency Kit in each classroom and School Crisis Response Bug
-
Out Bags 
located in the office of each site. These kits are readily accessible to teachers and staff and can be used should a serious 
emergency 
occur. Included in these bags are copies of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan, the Suicide Prevention Plan, 
and the AED Plan. Also included are emergency supplies appropriate for use by a classroom or school site. These kits are 
updated annually and as 
needed throughout the school year.

A constructive evaluation process promotes quality instruction and is a fundamental element in a sound educational 
program. Evaluations and informal or formal observations are designed to encourage 
common goals and to comply with 

teachers are evaluated at least once every other year, or as otherwise determined by contractual agree
ment. Evaluations 
are conducted by the principals, who have been trained and certified for competency to perform teacher evaluations. 
Evaluation criteria includes: engaging and supporting all students in learning, understanding and organizing subject matte
r 
for student learning, assessing student learning, creating and maintaining effective environments for student learning, 
planning instruction and designing learning experiences for all students, and developing as a professional educator.
 
 
Staff members bu
ild teaching skills and concepts through participation in conferences and workshops throughout the 
year.
 
 
Strathmore Elementary School District offered four staff development days per year in the last four school years and has 
contracted with the teachers 
to add one more staff development day this year. Topics included training on curriculum 
being used in the classroom, the use of technology (including programs such as Aeries, Edusoft, LEXIA, and the use of 
devices in the classroom), Kagan Strategies and Le
ader in Me principles. In addition to training on staff development days, 
teachers were observed in their classrooms using Kagan strategies by a qualified Kagan coach twice during each of the last 
three years and, in addition to training, have had Leader i
n Me coaching this year.
 
 
In 2017
-
2018, SUESD introduced The Leader In Me to all staff members and has incorporated it in the District at all levels. 
Teachers and staff have attended multiple days of training in each school year since then, and will contin
ue to receive 
training throughout this school year and beyond. This will include at least one day of coaching by Leader in Me staff to 
help our teachers better incorporate Leader in Me principles in their classrooms.
 
 
Strathmore Union Elementary School Dis
trict recruits and employs the most qualified credentialed teachers whenever 
possible. Teachers with less than a full credential receive expert mentoring from experienced teachers to help them 
develop skills needed to be successful in our classrooms.
