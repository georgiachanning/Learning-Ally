Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or 
career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Professional development in MCS is data 
driven using research
-
based best practices to ensure our students receive 
guaranteed and viable curriculum in every grade, in every school.    We use formative and summative data to drive our 
instructional decisions and focus for professional development. 
 
To this end, we utilize multiple structures  to provide 
high
-
quality professional development to our staff including:  summer training, preservice
-
days, district wide professional 
development days, after school workshops, Saturday workshops, substitute
-
re
lease days, instructional coaching, a BTSA 
and PAR program,  and most recently a 0.5% compensation package for those who choose to complete an extra 6 hours 
of professional development.
 
 
MCS has prioritized our focus on mathematics, literacy across grades 
and content areas, collaboration, welcoming 
schools/customer service, and building our capacity as professionals.  This has been in addition to the needed training in 
new adoptions, curriculum and standard updates and the like.  The professional developmen
t is sustained through site 
administration, district and site level instructional coaches, and intervention specialists.  In the 2019
-
202 academic year, 
a new division was also created in order to increase the quality and quantity of professional developme
nt provided to 
classified, certificated, and managers alike.
