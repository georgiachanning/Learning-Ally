Kinetic Academy provides an academically rigorous standard-aligned Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) educational program through Project-based learning.  Currently, our school serves 286 students in grades TK-6 that includes: 61% White, 7% Asian, 20% Hispanic, 6% 2+ Races, 1% African-American, 11% Students with Disabilities (SWD), 2% English Language Learners (ELL), and 22% Socio-economically Disadvantaged.   !MISSION Through an interdisciplinary educational experience, Kinetic Academy seeks to prepare students for 21st century careers as members of a democratic society through an interdisciplinary educational experience that provides them with a foundation for their lifetime.    !!!2018-19 SARC: KINETIC ACADEMY
!3 !VISION To support our mission of preparing students for 21st century careers, Kinetic Academy will integrate technical and academic education to prepare students for post-secondary education in both high tech and liberal arts fields via an emphasis on science, technology, engineering, art, and math. As STEAM focuses on integration of content, pairing STEAM with Project-based Learning (PBL) allows our students to integrate STEAM concepts through real-world experiences outside of the classroom.   At Kinetic Academy, we believe students learn best by doing. It is this basic principle that guides the educational philosophy of Kinetic Academy. Students are provided with a scenario where they may be asked to design and construct the best building or bridge to withstand a volcanic event. Research, discussion, teamwork, design, math, and reflective writing are all incorporated into a single, engaging project. This is our goal. Additionally, Kinetic Academy offers all students with enrichment in the form of foreign language, fine arts, physical education, and financial education. Community Service is required of every student using service based learning projects.  Kinetic AcademyÕs educational program emphasizes multicultural understanding, foreign language acquisition and academic achievement for college readiness. For native Spanish speakers, this vision includes opportunities to develop proficient reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills in Spanish, to enhance this natural asset for their personal and professional benefit. Kinetic Academy also deepens studentsÕ commitment to public participation through community service learning and student government. To accomplish these goals and to help students meet the California State Standards, Kinetic Academy focuses on an integrated curriculum, global and multicultural themes, real world learning applications, community service and leadership opportunities, a strong foreign learning program and an academic advisory program. Kinetic AcademyÕs small school model provides a nurturing and supportive learning environment for each child to ensure academic success.

Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and  ¥!The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs of study.
