By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Sierra School's mission is; in a working partnership with famili
es and community members, seeks to establish and sustain 
an enriched educational environment for each child.  We are committed to empower all children to meet the challenges 
of an ever
-
changing world with collaboration, kindness, responsibility, and succes
s.
 
 
Sierra School serves 461 Transitional Kindergarten through fifth grade children.  Sierra is located in the foothills of the 
Sierra Nevada Mountains, in the small city of Placerville.  Sierra maintains high academic expectations for all students, and
 
ha
s been rewarded for academic success at both the state and national level.  Sierra was named a Title I Academic 
Excellence School in 2008, 2009 and 2010.  Sierra was named a California Distinguished School in 2008, and in 2009 Sierra 
was awarded the highes
t honor when we were named a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence.  In 2009, 2013, and 
2014 Sierra was also named a California Business for Education Excellence Honor Roll School.
 
 
The staff at Sierra School believes that every student can learn. Syst
ems and structures are in place to support students 
wherever they are in the learning process to insure they meet their full potential. Students performing below, at, and 
above grade level are supported in their learning through differentiation in the clas
sroom and by our intervention team.
 
 
Sierra has a full day kindergarten program and in 2013 added a transitional kindergarten class.  Our full day program, 
which began in 1996, has allowed for more rigorous academic development, while still allowing ample 
time for the 


first th

students can also test into flexible reading groups if they already have knowledge of letter names and sounds. Flex reading 
classes meet Monda
y through Thursday.  Intermediate grade teachers continue to reinforce phonics skills learned in lower 
grades. Fourth and fifth grade students are placed in flexible leveled reading and math groups. These groups are referred 
to as WIN (What I Need) Groups.
 
These groups change on a regular basis as determined by grade level common formative 
assessment data. Students are provided with remediation, grade level practice, or enrichment depending on their needs.
 
 
Sierra has 26 fully credentialed teachers serving 
children in grades transitional kindergarten through fifth.
 
 

Children are given many and varied opportunities to become academically suc
cessful.  The Learning Center and a self

on offerings, there is a 
Title I program serving the needs of non

special education children who score below the proficient level on common 
formative assessments and on district benchmark tests. Teachers work closely to analyze, monitor, and respond to 
ass
essment data.
 
 
Sierra has an extended day program beginning at 6:45 each morning.  Students enrolled in the extended day program may 
remain after school until 6:00 p.m.  The program operates full days for the same hours during summer months and many 
holida
y periods.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Sierra School underwent a massive modernization construction project during the summer of 2008.  Eighteen classrooms 
were remodeled and updated with new cabinetry, walls, floors, and doors.  All student and staff bathrooms
 
were also 
completely remodeled.  Administration has office space that includes a meeting room and offices for Speech and the 
Nurse and Psychologist.  Extensive work was done to our walkways and access staircases to bring them up to California 
Code.  All H
VAC Systems have been replaced with new, efficient systems.
 
 
The custodial staff works diligently to maintain and upgrade the buildings and grounds.  We survey our students, parents, 
and staff members annually to inform and guide our facilities and safety 
plan. All efforts to ensure building safety, 
cleanliness, and adequacy have been successful.
 
 
Every class is housed in its own classroom.  The Special Day Class, the Learning Center and Title I programs each occupy 
separate classrooms.  There is a fully fu
nctioning and well
-
equipped library with a 6
-
hour per day aide.  Lunchtime 
supervisors are employed to promote safety each day during recess.  At Sierra we run three
-
lunch periods to lower our 
supervisor to student ratio on the playground and further impro
ve our children's safety.  Fire or other emergency drills 
and procedures are conducted monthly.  Sierra shares the services of a school nurse and a school psychologist  with two 
other schools within the district.  Through a partnership between the school d
istrict and a very generous community grant, 
Sierra has a full time school counselor.
 
 
The Sierra campus has a beautiful, functional outdoor classroom.  The classroom, located in our garden area,  was 
completed with funding from a Lowe's Tool Box grant, a 
grant from the local Native Plant Society and funds from our 
Parent Club.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who 
participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who r
eceived 
scores.

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
High standards for instruction, orderly, safe and clean buildings and grounds, and effective teaching techniques and 
practices, foster a positive and productive teaching and learning environment with an important emphasis on powerfu
l 
learning.  Parents and staff indicate strong feelings that the school is oriented toward personal and academic success for 
all students and toward helping students learn responsibility and respect for themselves and others.
 
 
Every student 

closely.  Tardiness is also monitored regularly, with parents being involved in solving problems surrounding attendance 
and tardiness. There has be
en one student expulsion from Sierra in the past 16 years.  Most student suspensions are 
handled in school, with students being sent home rarely, and even then, only after all other reasonable disciplinary 
techniques have been tried.
 
 
A positive learning c
limate is fostered through the concept of mutual respect 

 
teacher to student, student to teacher, 

students gathered on the playground for 
announcements and the flag salute. Students regularly participate in activities 
centered on our Word of the Month focusing on positive character traits.  Students exemplifying the qualities being taught 
in Positive Action, our character education curriculu
m, are rewarded and recognized at a monthly assembly featuring our 
school mascot, Sparky.

Sierra staff and students are all part of the district
-
wide initiative to stop bullying in our schools.  All students sign a pledge 
during the first week of school p
romising to help keep our schools free from bullying.  Referrals to the office for 
inappropriate behavior are tracked and categorized by the incident so that we can monitor the success of our anti
-
bullying 
program.  As part of this program students are rec
ognized each month as Sierra Peacemakers.  Additionally, Second Step 
(social emotional learning curriculum) is taught in each classroom throughout the school year.
 
 
Sierra's Emergency Operations Plan is updated and reviewed with staff each school 
year.  The School Site Council (SSC) 
provides input for the Comprehensive School Safety Plan.

Professional Development for our teaching staff is determined each year by the goals established by our Board of Trustees, 
our most recent testing data and input from the faculty. In the past, 
teachers were able to take part in  running record 
training through Scholastic and trauma informed practices training.  Love and Logic training will be offered for all 
employees this school year.  In addition we have teachers who take advantage of the trai
ning opportunities offered at our 
El Dorado County Office of Education.   We continue to support our staff by providing ongoing professional development 
for Guided Language Acquisitions and Design or GLAD.  This intensive training provides teachers with in
structional 
strategies that support both English Learners and access to Common Core Standards.
