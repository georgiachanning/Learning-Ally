Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Adelaide Price School was constructed in 1954 and was named for the first school nurse of the Anaheim Elementary 
School District. Adelaide is remembered fondly by the residents as a caring individua

the children of Anaheim. We continue to carry her legacy by creating an atmosphere where everyone is valued.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
Price School is a place where everyone learns and everyone teaches. Our school vision is to r
ecognize the unique value 
of each person and child, to provide an active learning environment that is both safe and supportive, and to promote a 
continuing partnership between home, school, and community. Working as a team, our mission is to provide the 
op
portunity for ALL students to acquire the necessary academic, social, emotional, and physical skills, which will 
empower them to become productive, responsible citizens of our world. At Price, we are building a better world, one 
student at a time.
 
 
Instruc
tional Program
 
The common core state standards comprise the curriculum. Course outlines, district assessment, report cards, and 
classroom practice are all designed to ensure student achievement on common core state standards. Our instructional 
focus is to 
provide a standards
-
based curriculum with assessments to support learning for all students.
 
 
Student Support Services
 
All students have access to the core curriculum through a variety of instructional programs. Mainstream English, 
 
English 
Language Mainstr
eam, and Structured English Immersion programs are offered to all students. Waivers are processed 
for parents selecting an alternative program. At Price School, we offer a Dual Language Immersion Program for students 
in K
-
6 grade. This alternative educatio
nal program enables students to learn grade level common core state standards in 
both English and Spanish. In addition, a formal English language development program is offered to all Emerging 
Bilinguals, with teachers modifying their instruction to meet t
he needs of English language proficiency levels in the 
classroom.
 
 
Student progress is monitored through formal and informal testing, review of standardized test scores, district 
assessments, and pacing charts. An academic Intervention Plan is 
developed for students in danger of retention and 
closely monitored throughout the year. Students with special needs receive the services of a speech therapist and a 
resource specialist. Students requiring the services of a self
-
contained special education
 
setting are bused to a nearby 
school. In addition, students identified as gifted and talented are given the opportunity to participate in the Gifted and 
Talented Education (GATE) Program offered at Price and throughout the District.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

and Spanish. In addition, opportunities for parental and community input are provided 
through the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) and the School Site Council (SSC). Parents are encouraged to participate in 
PTA sponsored school activities such as education
al programs, special assemblies, parent education activities, and other 
family night events offered throughout the year. Our partnerships with the Business Community, OC GRIP (Orange County 
Gang Reduction Intervention Partnership) and Salvation Army are ex
emplary and help support special projects at our site 
and promote student achievement.

that everyone in the school community know their duties and feel confident about the proper st
eps to take in case of an 
emergency.
 
 
The school safety plan is a public document and will be readily available for inspection at the school site and at the distri

coaching framework and maximize individual
ized professional learning for teachers through lesson studies, co
