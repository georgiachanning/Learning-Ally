School Description
 
Welcome to Parkview School. At Parkview we believe that a successful educational program must 
include respect as well as 
cooperation between home and school. To achieve this goal, we 
encourage parents to participate in the decision
-
making process. With the help of parents and the 
community, Parkview strives to achieve its goal of educating every child to the fullest possible
 
extent.
 
 
Parkview School is located in Taft and draws its student population from both incorporated and 
unincorporated areas of Taft . The school is within the city limits and has sidewalks, sewers, and 
public parks. Parkview School is one of four primary
 
schools in the Taft City School District and 
serves up to 350 students in grades TK
-
3. Two Transitional Kindergarten classes are now in 
operation servicing 25 students in each from around the city of Taft. We are very proud of our TK 
classes and the amazi
ng growth these students make to prepare for Kindergarten.  Tremendous 
changes have been implemented in the areas of curriculum planning, staff development, student 
assessment, and intervention.  We now have teacher leaders in each grade level who help to 
drive 
our curriculum development and implementation as well as our student achievement in test scores.  
Additionally, we have the Teacher Induction program and our District supports our interns, PIPS 
and STPS by providing mentors to these teachers.  Parkvi
ew is proud that we received the 2016 and 
2017 CA Honor Roll Awards for our State test scores.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a 
School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Loc
al Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with 
data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about th
e LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or t
he 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority:
 
Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smar
ter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible
 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

nthly calendar is sent home. The PTO meets about once a month and School 
Site Council (SSC) and English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) meet approximately 6 times a year.  The Parkview PTO meets 
almost monthly to help 
with fundraising and special events
 
for the students.

School Safety Plan
 
Parkview School provides an environment that is safe and nurturing. School personnel supervise all school activities closely.
 
We have 
staff on campus 
before school at 7:45 and after school duty as well.  We teach and consistently enforce safety procedures for the playground,
 
classrooms, and all other 
areas. All visitors enter through the secure main entrance and all gates remain locked t
hroughout the day. The main office clears all campus visitors and 
staff members immediately report the arrival of any unidentified person on the school premises. All staff members, substitute
s, and visitors wear ID tags.  
Additionally, the school staff is 
provided with a District Safety Handbook detailing procedures for action in the event of an unsafe event. We have monthly 
fire drills and bi
-
annual earthquake and lockdown drills.
