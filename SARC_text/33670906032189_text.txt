Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 27, 2019
 
 
Jurupa Unified School District conducts an evaluation of instructional materials to adopt materials that best meet the 
needs of students. The district conducts adoptions on a districtwide basis. The review process includes a committee 
of a 
majority of classroom teachers in the appropriate discipline (Education Code Section 60210). In addition, all instructional 
materials are in compliance with social content standards. When making adoption decisions, the adoption committee uses 
the cont
ent standards, the curriculum frameworks, the State Board of Education
-
adopted evaluation criteria, and the 
reports on each adoption as resources. The final decision for selecting and recommending textbook adoptions is with the 
adoption committee. The most
 
recently adopted textbooks were selected from the state
-
approved list.
 
 
All students, including English learners, have standards
-
aligned textbooks checked out to them, to use in class and to take 
home, in each of the core curriculum areas of reading/langu
age arts, mathematics, science and history/social science; 
foreign language and health; visual and performing arts; and science laboratory equipment for grades nine through twelve 
as appropriate.
 
 
Elementary students receive core curriculum textbooks on th
e first day of enrollment.  Middle school and high school 
students receive textbooks checked out to them at registration days a few days before the first day of school.  All students 
enrolling after the first day of school have core curriculum textbooks ch
ecked out to them by the Library Clerk on their 
first day of enrollment.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Professional Development
 
The Jurupa Unified School 
district is committed to providing high
-
quality, research
-
based professional development to all 
of its teachers. During the 2017
-
2018 school year, training included the continued implementation of California Common 
Core State Standards for mathematics and 
English Language Arts.    ELA and math Units of Study committees continue to 
refine the units based on teacher feedback.  Trainings are offered at various times of the year by district department. The 
use of DIBELS (Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Litera
cy Skills) has expanded to K
-
3 with teacher receiving training in 
effective strategies for learning, assessment and intervention.  Teachers on the NGSS committee continue to meet to 
develop mini
-
units for their grade levels. Grade level teachers met in dis
trict wide cohort NGSS training throughout the 
year where the mini lessons were presented and discussed.   Teachers collaborate and learn together during these 
observations.  As part of year 2 implementation of AVID Elementary, a group of five teachers att
ended Summer Institute 
where they learned effective teaching strategies.  This core group of teachers has demonstrated some of these strategies 
throughout the year to the rest of the staff. Teachers had the opportunity to participate in Universal Design fo
r Learning 
training.  New teachers continue to receive training in Balanced Math.
 
 
Mission Bell is in its third year of Impact Team implementation.  Teachers in grades 2
-
5 are learning the protocols and 
processes of helping students monitor and assess thei
r own readiness and efforts to set personal learning goals.  Teachers 
are also learning protocols that help them to assess student work and to use the data to inform instruction.
 
 
 
Staff development and curricular improvement are planned and implemented to
 
improve student achievement. By 

-
development activities enable the instructional staff to 
deliver curriculum and instruction based upon program needs. The school sustains high interest in 
professional growth 
and improvement.  The district provided teachers with the opportunities to participate in GATE training. Independently, 

ll 
teachers attend weekly meetings to analyze current data and grade
-
level collaboration provides opportunities for teachers 
to work together to improve instruction. Student data is used to help drive the instruction along with a focus on state 
standards.
