About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schoo
ls have books in core classes for all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far mor
e meaningful when along with 
the more detailed description of textbook

in our core classes and their dates of publication.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Each school site has classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library and an administration 
building. The number of classrooms at each school site varies, 
depending on enrollment and available space. Several sites have portable class rooms to accommodate increased enrollment and 
to meet the guidelines 
for Class Size Reduction (CSR).
 
 
Maintenance 
and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the
 
highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that all classrooms, restrooms, and facilities are 
well
-
maintained and in good 
repair. The principal works daily with the custodial 
staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Improvements
 
In the fall of 2009 the primary playground asphalt was resurfaced to increase safety of the area.
 
 
Stockton Unified takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clea
n, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, we utilize the facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California OPSC. The full report is available upon request.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter

s calculated 
by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students w
ho met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of studen
ts who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievem
ent level percentages are calculated using only students who received scores.

School Safety Plan
 
Our school adheres strongly to the Emergency Response Crisis Management (ERCM) preparing staff, students and parents with app
ropriate instructions, 
training and practice in how to act and react 
in case of an emergency. All conceivable actions are taken to ensure the safety and welfare of students and 

ty regulations. Each ye
ar a deep 
cleaning process occurs during a close of school, either during the summer or other extended breaks. In the event of a facili
ty plant emergency, the 
principal notifies appropriate site and district personnel to resolve the emergency and safely se
cure or evacuate the students, based upon the site and 
district emergency preparedness plans. A site review with the district Internal Evaluation Instrument (IEI)  occurs annually.
 
 
A Comprehensive School Safety Plan, which was recently reviewed by the Sch
ool Site Council, helps to provide a secure, peaceful and clean environment 

ral disasters. Emergency 
drills are conducted on a mont
hly basis.
 
 
Every effort is made to ensure students are monitored while on campus throughout the school day. Yard supervisors, teachers, 
site administrators, and 
school staff provide supervision for students before and during school. The playground is safe
 
for all students and gates are all closed limiting access to 
our campus during the school day. All visitors must sign in at the office and receive proper authorization to be on campus an
d must display their passes 
at all times.

The primary staff development focus has been on the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) Units of Study developed by SUSD teach
ers through the 
Rigorous Curriculum Design Process. The content was selected due to 
the full implementation of the CCSS in California in 2017
-
2018 and the related 
CAASPP state assessment to be implemented in spring of 2018.
 
 
Professional development in the core standards and units of instruction was initially provided through full day off
 
site professional development training 
sessions. Two full day sessions were provided in 2016
-
2017 and 2017
-
2018. This year, 2018
-
2019, teachers new to Stockton Unified, or who request 
additional subject content training will be provided opportunities offe
red through our Staff Professional Development Center (PDC). Hazelton teachers 
will continue developing it's Professional Learning Community (PLC) to fully implement Common Core Units of Study, AVID (Adva
ncement Via Individual 
Determination) and PBIS (Posi
tive Behavior Intervention and Support). Additionally, onsite instructional coaching is provided for every Hazelton teacher.
