By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Mission Statement:  The mission of Harry Dewey Fundamental Elementary School was created collaboratively with staff, 
parents, and community through site strategic planning.
 
 
Valuing community
 
and academic excellence, the mission of Harry Dewey Fundamental Elementary School is to inspire 
and educate each child to be a vibrant part of a community of life
-
long learners who embrace stewardship of their world 
and develop creative problem
-
solving sk
ills and confidence through a focus on the whole child

mind, body, heart

that 
includes innovative instruction, strong character development and essential family participation in a safe, supportive 
environment.
 
 
School Profile
 
Harry Dewey Fundamental Elementary is one of the elementary schools in the San Juan Unified School District.  Dewey is 
nestled in a wonderful little neighborhood and these neighbors take great care of the school. The curriculum at Dewey is 
aligned to Calif
ornia Common Core Standards.  Dewey's programs reflect the interests and needs of its community and 
offers many different programs to families. Dewey also houses the K
-
6 Deaf and Hard of Hearing Program for SJUSD.
 
 
At Dewey we believe strongly in our missi
on of doing more than just educating the mind.  We believe in helping to create 
citizens of the world by focusing on the whole child.  The process of learning is just as important as the product.  We want 
to know how students arrive at the final product an
d the thinking that goes into the process. Students are discussing, 
debating and collaborating each day.  They are able to support their thinking orally and in writing.  This is what the world 
asks of all of us 

 
we are preparing our students now.
 
 
We firm
ly believe that it takes a village to raise a child and we need families on board to ensure our students have an 
optimal educational experience.  Parent engagement is an important factor in the success of our program.  We ask for our 
families pitch in to v
olunteer time and talent!  At Dewey, parents and teachers regularly communicate and partner in 
support of students.
 
 
SCHOOL PROGRAMS
 
School Wide Character Education program
 
Through the Harper for Kids Foundation and One School One Book grant, we are utilizing the book by Coach John Wooden, 
"Inch and Miles, the Journey to Success" to guide our character education program.  We utilize class meetings, family 
nights, and rich lit
erature among other tools to weave character education into the very foundation of our school.
 
 
Technology
 
Dewey has a state of the art computer lab that is kept up to date through generous funding by Dewey's Parent Faculty 
Organization (PFO).  PFO is our 
parent organization that raises funds that provide students access to technology, field 
trips, and much more.

Students are expected to regularly utilize the different forms of media and technology in the computer lab to research 
topics of interest.  Teach

enables them to create lessons that are highly engaging, provide visual support, and develop 21st century skills that 
students will need to be successful in t
heir world as they grow.  Dewey also has several sets of iPads and Chromebooks to 
develop students' technology skills and support their classroom instruction.
 
 
Sign Language
 
One of Dewey's gems is the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Program that is housed on our 
site.  We have students that are deaf 
and hard of hearing.  Many are mainstreamed out into our general education classrooms.  This provides a very unique 
opportunity for all of our students to learn a different culture and language.  We offer a school club
 
called Dewey Student 
Signers whose primary goal is to develop Sign Language vocabulary in our students.  We also have a River Cats signing 
team that learns the National Anthem and performs at a River Cats baseball game once a year.
 
 
Olweus And Second Step
 
Anti
-
Bullying Program
 
We have implemented the Olweus Anti
-
Bullying Program and this year have also introduced Second Step Lessons as well.  
Both programs actively engage all members of our community in our crusade against bullying.  While bullying is not 
pervasive on our campus, it is imperative to us that we remain vigilant and ahead of the bullying epidemic sweeping 
schools.  These programs include class meetings, extensive staff training, as well as student and parent learning to respond 
to bullying.
 
 
P
ublic Speaking
 

reports, reciprocal teaching and other methods beginning in kindergarten.  When our students leave us, they take with 
t
hem strong public speaking skills.
 
 
Family Engagement
 
Dewey is a school where family engagement is a cornerstone.  Research shows achievement is higher for students whose 
families are engaged in the educational process.  We ask that families spend 12 hours
 
in the classroom or within the school 
in some other capacity per trimester per child.  We depend on our parents.  We value the time and energy they devote to 
our school and our students.
 
 
Band
 
We offer band for our students.  Research shows that students 
involved in music and fine arts stay in school longer and 
tend to do better than students not engaged in the fine arts.
 
 
School Site Council (SSC)
 
The School Site Council is the parent voice in school governance.  The SSC function and requirements are mand
ated by 
the state.  It is composed of equal parts: parents, teachers and the school principal.  School improvement decisions are 
made through the School Site Council.  The SSC reviews test scores, provides ongoing analysis of educational programs, 
monitors
 
the budget, and helps to develop our school vision and mission.  Members are elected for a two
-
year term.
 
 
Family Nights
 
Family nights are held at many different times during the school year.  Some are purely fun
-
based, while others are science 
or 
math
-
based. These programs allow our school to come together in a large setting to learn and play together.  Some of 
our traditional evenings events include Fall Festival, Santa's Night, Science Night, & Ceramics Night.
 
 
Strategic Planning
 
Dewey staff and 
parents completed our strategic planning process in Spring of 2012. Our goals are to align ourselves more 
fully with our district strategic plan and to create a cohesive set of goals and actions to guide us to where we want to be. 
 
Because of this process 
we have tightened our focus and created a map that mirrors our strategic plan.

Year 
and month in which data were collected:
 
September, 2018
 
 
San Juan Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018 and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equ
ipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom a
nd to take home. 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are rev
iewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption. The table disp
lays information collected in September 2018 about the quality, currency, and availability of 
the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. If you would like more information 
on the textbooks and instructional materi
als please visit our website: http://www.sanjuan.edu/Page/23485 In July 2009, 
EC Section 60200.7. The State Board of Education has adopted frameworks for ELA/ELD, Math, Science and Social 
Sciences, and has identified an approved list of instructional mater
ials available for adoption. For more information

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Dewey Elementary School, originally constructed in 1956, was modernized during the 1995
-
1996 school year. The scope 
included: roof/repair or replacement, interio
r and exterior painting, new lighting, selected window system replacement, 
energy
-
efficient heating and upgrade, new doors with handicapped accessible hardware, restroom restoration, electrical 
infrastructure upgrade to provide for internet, cable, telepho
ne, throughout the school. Currently, there is sufficient space 
to house the student population. Site custodial staff clean the buildings, along with district support for major/minor 
repairs. The district provides gardening and landscape services on a regu
lar schedule. Regular fire/emergency drills are 
held and badges are required for all visitors and personnel.  During the summer of 2008 the parking lot and hard court 
areas were overlaid and a new parking area was added funded through the Measure J bond. I
n 2008 the site received a 
complete HVAC installation and in 2009 the student restroom facilities were updated, both projects funded by Measure 
J.
 
 
The Board of Education and the Superintendent's policy is to ensure that all students are provided with a sa
fe and well
-
maintained learning environment. The board approved resolutions in 1998 and 2002 to adequately fund maintenance 
activities and preserve the repairs and improvements funded by two facility bond measures. The school buildings, 
classrooms and grou
nds are safe, clean and functional. An inspection of the facility was conducted in September 2019 and 
determined that there were no unsafe conditions that required emergency repairs. District maintenance staff ensures 
that the repairs necessary to keep the
 
school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
computer automated work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs and health and 
safety repairs are given the highest priority. The Board of Edu
cation has adopted cleaning standards and custodial staffing 
requirements for all schools in the district. This school meets the Board's standards for custodial staffing and cleanliness.
 
The school's custodians are trained in the proper use of cleaning che
micals and Integrated Pest Management techniques. 
They are managed day to day by the Principal with assistance from the district's maintenance department. The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, with funding allocated fo
r major repair or replacement 
of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. Annually the district budgets $2 million doll
ars for deferred 
maintenance activities.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of stu
dents who met the standard (i.e.,

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who partici
pated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievem
ent level percentages are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

a Community Safety Specialist assigned to this school within a geographic zone that includes nearby schools. In addition, 
via a part


school. The Deputy Sherif
fs are assigned to patrol a geographic zone either on the east side of the district or the west side 
of the district. They are assigned specific schools within their assigned zone and respond to this school, or others, as safe
ty 
needs dictate. The two CHPD
 
Police Officers are School Resource Officers (SRO) who work identified schools within the 
City of Citrus Heights and respond as safety needs dictate. The two law enforcement agencies will overlap response when 

fficers are dispatched to critical incidents via the Safe Schools Dispatcher, 
a law enforcement dispatcher or via a direct report from a school staff member, school visitor or other person. This school 
has a school safety team which reviews safety matters 
that may affect the campus. Our school safety team meets regularly 
to discuss safety issues, update our site emergency plan, and to take steps to be proactive in preventing various types of 
school
-
related safety issues. Community Safety Specialists and law
 
enforcement provides speakers to address students, 
staff and community groups on matters of school safety. Our safety team receives training, when requested, from Safe 
Schools or law enforcement. This school is responsible for updating our Comprehensive S
chool Safety Plan (CSSP) by March 
1st of every year per the Education Code. As part of the update, this school meets at least once per year with a law 
enforcement officer to review the CSSP, has the local fire department review the CSSP and we hold a commu
nity meeting 
to review the CSSP. The CSSP must be approved by the School Site Council before being submitted to the district safe 

site sp
ecific crisis response procedures and a district standardized emergency flip chart. This school conducts and keeps a 
record of all fire drills, lockdown drills, shelter in place drills and/or earthquake drills up to or in excess of what is re
quired 
by the 
Education Code.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Developme

Professional development is a key part of the continuous improvement process for educators. The goal of our quality 
professional development is to support the learning of teachers and paraprofessionals to positively impact student 
achievement.  Annually, t
eachers and site administrators participate in professional development in a variety of 
opportunities.  Seventy
-
five minutes per week are dedicated to staff collaboration and training planned by site leadership 
teams. The District also provides a cycle of 
continuous professional development for Administrators through Principal 
Networks as well as Leadership Academies.
 
 
The District provides professional development opportunities for teachers and administrators that support the 
implementation of Common 
Core State Standards in English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and the 
ELA/ELD Framework.  Specific professional development initiatives include: Culturally Responsive Practices, Critical 
Literacy, TK
-
2 Reading, Supporting Independenc
e and Engagement through Reading and Writing, Math to the Core, 
Expository Reading and Writing Course, and ELD Foundations.  District departments, Center for Teacher Support, grant
-

training opportunities.  Professional 
development opportunities are voluntary for teachers and are provided throughout the year in a variety of formats: during 
the school day, after school, on Saturdays, and during summer and vacation breaks. Many teachers
 
and administrators 
also take advantage of opportunities with Sacramento County Office of Education, California Department of Education, 
the college/university programs, state/national education organizations, and private educational institutes.
 
 
What grou
nds the professional development in the district is the District Strategic Plan and the Local Control 
Accountability Plan. Professional Development is further determined using one or more of the following: (a) student 
achievement data, (b) staff survey dat
a, and (c) district
-
identified goals.  Professional development addresses the Common 
Core State Standards, teaching strategies, curriculum, assessment, technology, classroom management, safety, and 
leadership. Administrator training accompanies professiona
l development in district focus areas, providing 
implementation support for teachers on site.  Content
-
area coaches are available at some schools.  Additional classroom 
support is provided to new and struggling teachers by consulting teachers from the Cent
er for Teacher Support.
