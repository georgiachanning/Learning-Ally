Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Parent involvement and community volunteers are key to our success at Mark West. There are a wide variety of 
opportunities for parent involvement at Mark West, from volunteering in classrooms, on field trips, to organizing and 
participating in fundraisers and family social events. Parents are encouraged to join Mark West PTA which provides 
support for enrichment 
in the form of field trips, assemblies, and extra supplies for the classrooms. A second parent 
organization, The Mark West Education Foundation is a non
-
profit organization whose goal is to build a permanent and 
ongoing financial resource from private dona
tions to support our four district schools. The Education Foundation currently 
funds the music program for the Mark West Union School District. Further opportunities for parent involvement include 
participation in advisory committees such as our School Sit

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The school's 
comprehensive safety plan is on file at the district office as well as the school site. It outlines procedures, 
following SEMS, for emergencies or natural disasters. The plan is reviewed and updated each year by staff and the SSC. 
Fire, earthquake, or lock
-
down drills are conducted monthly. Safety inspections are done routinely by the maintenance 
department, especially prior to school opening.
 
 
The staff roles in case of an emergency are outlined in the comprehensive plan. A "flip
-
book" of emergency respons
es for 
various situations and drill procedures are kept in an obvious location in each classroom. Classrooms and all common 
areas (library, computer lab, for example) are equipped with a red emergency bag containing first aid supplies.
 
 
In August, the Mark
 
West staff reviews the Mark West BEST Plan. The Mark West BEST Plan is the guiding document to 
ensure a safe learning environment for all students. BEST is an acronym for Building Effective Schools Together. It is a 
system which gives staff, students, and
 
community a structure to look at discipline data, target areas for student training, 
and to celebrate student successes. This guide specifies the student, parent, administrative, teacher, and school staff 
responsibilities to be follow ed in order to achie
ve the Mark West BEST Plan goals. There are three overarching behavior 
expectations (be safe, be respectful, be responsible). From these three expectations, specific areas (e.g. lunch, playground,
 
hallway) are organized by what safe, respectful, and respon
sible student
-
actions look like.

The Mark West BEST Plan is meant to be an effective positive
-
behavior change
-
tool which helps develop safe, respectful, 
and responsible behavior. It is a comprehensive plan which is intended to be clear, simple and practic
al. It is a collaborative 
effort which promotes consistency across staff, while respecting different styles of teaching and implementation.
 
 
Additionally,  ToolBox, a Social Emotional Learning program developed by Dovetail Learning, is used in grades 
TK
-
6. This 
program helps students to develop the resiliency and skills to address situations that may arise in a positive, healthy 
manner.
 
 
Violations of expectations will be addressed in a positive, respectful, reasonable, and related manner. Keeping in m
ind 
that mistakes are opportunities to learn and grow , consequences w ill be issued on a severity continuum that can include 
conference with the teacher, phone call to parent, written reflection or apology, conflict mediation, behavior plan, loss of 
privi
leges, suspension, or expulsion.

paraprofessional assistant support in grades kindergarten and first grade. Students may also be regrouped in the 
afternoon for additional support with reading and language arts skills, mathematics, and English La
nguage Development. 
Mark West has been able to use additional Concentration funds to support extended day learning opportunities for 
struggling students in addition to the school wide RtI support, as well as an extended year, or Summer School program for 
s
tudents struggling in learning to read (grades 1

Our staff development program is aligned with the 

personnel throughout the district to plan together and attend workshops on best practices for standards based 
instruction. With the state adoption of the Common Core State Standards a
nd a shift in assessment to a computer based 
assessment, the primary focus for staff development has been implementation of the newly adopted English Language 
Arts/ELD program: Wonders TK

6th. In support of our English Language Learners, sta
ff has received 
additional training in assisting EL's in meeting the CCSS. In alignment with our Strategic Plan, the district has provided 
support in the form of a Project Based Learning support teacher who goes into each classroom coaching and supporting 
teachers in planning and implementing project based learning in the classroom. All staff are receiving training and support 
in the area of Social Emotional Well being through our Director of Student Services and Counselor.
 
 
We utilize early release days, k
nown as "site days" and "district days" as well as faculty meetings
 
to provide training for staff. With the adoption of a new Common Core aligned English Language Arts/ELD program, an 
area of focus during early release days has been in support of implement
ation. Professional development in the area of 
math has also been ongoing.
 
 
All new teachers participate in the North Coast Teacher Induction Program through Sonoma County Office of Education 
during their first two years of teaching. These classes are held
 
after school hours and each new teacher is assigned an 
experienced mentor for the entire process. More experienced teachers participate in training according to their needs 
and interests.
