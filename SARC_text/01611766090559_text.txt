School Description
 
The mission of Millard Elementary School is to challenge every student by providing rigorous 
learning experiences to reach high levels of academic achievement.  We work to inspire students 
to meet or e
xceed individual learning goals and show growth based on assessments.  We commit 
to an integrated system of support to ensure a positive mindset in a safe and respectful 
environment.  We promote a Growth Mindset and strive to create an atmosphere of Restor
ative 
Practices.  As of the 2019
-
20 school year, our school serves students in kindergarten through fifth 
grade, as our sixth graders moved to Walters Middle School.
 
 
We continue to use the district
-
adopted character education program of the Eight 
Great Traits in 
conjunction with our 3 school rules 

 
Be Prepared, Be Respectful, Be Safe.  We focus on practicing 
the Eight Great Traits with Integrity; students are encouraged to self
-
monitor their own adherence 
to the Eight Great Traits.  We are committ
ed to creating safe, welcoming learning environments.  
Over the course of the school year, we engage in activities that promote resilience in our learners 
with our goal being to ensure our students safe and supported at Millard.  Students learn about the 
e
ffects of bullying, how to take steps to protect themselves and resolve issues in a restorative 
manner, and how to be an up
-
stander for others.
 
 
We have been using state and federal funds for general academic improvement and special 
assistance to our low
-
a
chieving students and English Learners to provide during
-
the
-
day 
intervention assistance.   Our School Site Council (SSC), which includes five parents and five school 
representatives, meets five times each year to oversee our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achiev
ement 

Our English Learners Advisory Committee (ELAC) meets five mornings during the school year.  
Instruction for English Learners and ways parents can suppor
t student achievement are discussed 
at these meetings.  Students are invited to attend the academic learning segment of the meeting, 
along with their parents.  During the second segment of the meeting, students are dismissed to 
before
-
school recess and the
 
adults focus on hearing reports from the DELAC representative and 
contributing feedback for budgetary and academic
-
related agenda items.  The feedback is relayed 
to the SSC and to the District English Learners Advisory Committee (DELAC), and it is used to
 
help 
guide decisions related to academic achievement of English Learners.
 
 
The site Instructional Leadership Team (ILT), consisting of the principal, a teacher representative 
from each grade level meets monthly to drive the work of the school.  We analyze
 
assessment data, 
monitor the effectiveness of our programs, review student work, and determine next best steps.  
We have an active PTA that provides funding for various student programs, including field trips for 
all Millard students each year.  Students 
attend theatrical performances, visit museums and our 
local mission, experience life on a farm, etc. as a result of this funding.
 
 
Our staff continues to work to provide our students with data
-
driven instruction using the 
Illuminate data system and data ga
thered from common formative and end
-
of
-
unit assessments 
administered in the classroom setting.  Teachers meet regularly as collaborative teams, during 
which time they work to create common formative assessments that measure student success 
toward meeting 
standards, to plan interventions for students who are not yet meeting standards 
and extension activities for students who have mastered standards, and to plan best practice 
strategies to teach students.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each 
year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local prior
ities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/g
uardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructi
onal Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core cla
sses for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presentin
g what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Millard Elementary was constructed in 1962 and opened in 1964.  We have one day custodian, and one full
-
time and one part
-
time night custodian.  The 
restrooms, Special Education classrooms, and shared 
kindergarten classrooms are cleaned every day, and the other classrooms are cleaned every other 
day.  District maintenance removes graffiti, paints as needed, and maintains landscaping on a monthly schedule. Ten of our cl
assrooms had new flooring 
installed
 
in the summer of 2015.  The staff room and book room had new flooring installed summer of 2016, and the library carpet was al
so replaced at 
that time.
 
 
The IT Department upgraded the internet system and its infrastructure during the 2016
-
17 school year.  
We transferred to use of the District data server 
during the 2017
-
2018 school year
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection To

on this report.  
Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report. Since that 
time, those conditions may have changed.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and gr
ade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive
 
disabilities); and

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school 
district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
At Millard Elementary, there are a variety of  ways for parents to be involved in their child

running smoothly.  Parents can join our School Site Council, which works with administration to oversee the instructional pro
grams as well as make 
informed financial decisions.  Parents of English Le
arners are vital to our English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) and to our outreach efforts on 
behalf of new families.  Room parents organize parent volunteers to help with special projects in the classroom and to chaper
one on field trips.  Our very 
act
ive PTA holds a fall membership drive with a goal of having all families join PTA each year.  Our PTA Board holds monthly Boa
rd meetings and four 
Association meetings throughout the year.  All members are invited.  Parents and students are invited to atten
d parent education events throughout the 
school year, including PTA sponsored math and science nights, as well as PTA family fun nights, including our fall carnival.

School Safety Plan
 
Teachers monitor the campus 15 minutes before school each day and during the morning and afternoon recesses.  Student Safety 
Patrol members as 
well as parent volunteers help supervise student dr
op
-
off and pick
-
up before and after school.Two teachers monitor students after school for fifteen 
minutes during parent/caretaker pickup.  The teachers perform a "sweep"of campus, making sure all students who have not been 
picked up are 
accounted for in th
e office where staff can contact parents for late pickups, as needed.   The principal, paid noon supervisors, and parent volu
nteers help 
ensure a safe and orderly lunchtime and subsequent recess.  We have a closed campus.  Visitors must sign in at the offi

to wear throughout their stay.  Adults without badges are approached and questioned by staff.
 
 
A committee of parents, teachers, and other school staff revises our Comprehensive School Safety Plan each year.  It was last
 
re
vised in March 2019.  
This plan includes procedures for emergencies and an inventory of safety supplies.  Throughout the year, we communicate our s
afety practices with our 
parents through our school newsletter.  We are currently working with our community 
on safe student release procedures in the event of an emergency.  
We have four disaster drills, monthly fire drills, and at least one lock down drill each year. Our PTA maintains and refurbis
hes the disaster supply sheds 
annually.  The sheds are inventorie
d, and expired food and water supplies are replaced.  Several staff members have received CPR and First Aid 
certification through a district adult education course and are trained in the administration of stock epi
-
pens, as well as in the administration of
 
specific 
medications to students with district health plans.
