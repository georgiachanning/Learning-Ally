Principal's Message
 
It is my pleasure to welcome you to John Baldwin 
Elementary School. As of the 19
-
20 school year 
we honored to have been serving our community for over 52 year as an elementary school. We 
pride ourselves in being a school that celebrates inclusivity, equity, diversity, and student voice. We 
strive to be a
 
campus that is welcoming and where each stake holder group, including students, 
parents, and staff are honored. At the forefront of everything that we do, every decision that is 
made, every lesson that is presented, we are reminded to do what is best for 
our students. Further, 
we wish to continually instill a love, joy, and wonder for learning. During the day, our hallways are 
filled with the sounds of students collaborating, laughing, and learning. In the evenings, members 
of our community gather for even
ts, or engaged in conversation as children enjoy our playground. 
On weekends, our fields are used for sport activities ranging from baseball to soccer.
 
 
Our site, nestled in the Brookside neighborhood of Danville, was named after John F. Baldwin, a 
disting
uished Northern Californian that served as a six time member of the House of 
Representatives. The school was established in 1968 and underwent a major reconstruction project 
in 2006. Baldwin Elementary serves approximately 515 students in Transitional Kind
ergarten 
through Fifth Grade. In 2016, John Baldwin was named a California Gold Ribbon School. John 
Baldwin was recognized as a California Distinguished School in 2014.
 
 
John Baldwin is equipped with 21st century learning technology, including 1
-
1 devices 
in 4th and 
5th grades, Computers on Wheels (COWS), iPad Carts, document cameras, projectors, and a 
Macbook Computer Lab. Our students receive instruction in reading and writing using a workshop 
model from teachers that have been extensively trained from Co
lombia University's Teachers 
College Reading and Writing Project. This method of instruction allows for differentiated 
curriculum, student choice, and increased student engagement. In collaboration with our district 
coaches and professional development fro
m the Silicon Valley Math Initiative, teachers guide 
students with math curriculum through the current textbook adoption, Eureka Math. Students 
participate in number talks, direct instruction, centers, independent practice, and adaptive 
technology, such as
 
Dream Box, on a daily basis. This year, our teachers have embarked on inquiry 
based science instruction through our most recent TWIG Science curriculum adoption. Community 
and inclusivity is promoted through our adoption of Sanford Harmon curriculum. Furt
her, through 
the help of parent volunteers that raise funds for our school, students receive specialized 
instruction in science lab, art, music, and physical education. Our students have the opportunity to 
participate in a variety of staff and parent volun
teer led activities, including: John Baldwin Student 
Council, Serving Our School Committee, Safety Patrol, Gardening Club, Math Olympiad, Odyssey of 
the Mind, Run Club, Lunch Time Drawing Club, Lunch Time Legos, Instrumental Band, Intramural 
Sports, Princi
pal's Challenges, John Baldwin Fun Run, Season of Enrichment, F.A.M.E Week, and 
more. 
 
 
Our staff works in close collaboration with parents and community members to provide our 
students a diverse and well
-
rounded education. These partnerships include our P
arent Teacher 
Association (PTA), John Baldwin Cougar Education Fund (JB CEF), and the John Baldwin School Site 
Council. It is through the work of these organizations that our students are able to receive 
additional instructional support from teachers, coun
selors, and para
-
educators. Our school's 
relationships with our parent community extends into daily instruction where parent volunteers 
assist in the classroom from Transitional Kindergarten through Fifth grade.

Our staff members are life long learners. 
Teachers and support staff regularly participate in ongoing professional development to ensure 
the implementation of best practices at our school. Site staff also participates in site and district committees, including, 
but not limited 
to: Workshop Profess
ional Development, Literacy Committee, Math Committee, Grade Level Representatives, Response to Intervention 
Committee, and our School Climate and Safety Committee.
 
 
In my daily interactions on campus people will often note that either they went to Baldwin
 
or that their children attended school at John 
Baldwin. Intrigued, I will ask, "What brought your family back?" Often times, I get a smile in response, "There is something 
special about 
this school."
 
 
I am sure that you will agree, many factors can be att
ributed to what makes John Baldwin special:
 

 
Our students are creative, enthusiastic, and persevere through the challenges they are presented.
 

 
The dedication and commitment of our staff to provide the best possible education for our students.
 

 
The 
unwavering support of our parent community and their generosity of time and resources.
 
 
I hope you find the information provided in our SARC report useful. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or conc
erns.

Mission Statement
 
We believe our students should be engaged and feel confident and empowered. Students are presented with differentiated curric
ulum 
that addresses all learning styles. As life long learners, teachers cultivate a love of learning in student
s by encouraging enthusiasm and 
creativity.
 
 
We believe that grade level teams should value communication, mutual support and shared experiences. Grade level teams provid
e one 
another a safe place to explore new educational practices and concepts. Grade le
vel teams provide a forum for the exchange of ideas 
with peers both in the same grade and in the entire school.
 
 
We believe the Baldwin community is a collaborative of parents, staff, and students. Our community provides support and oppor
tunities 
for stude
nts and teachers through classroom volunteers, innovative ideas, and compassion. Our community takes responsibility for 
funding school programs that are beyond the means available through site funds.
 
 
John Baldwin is a school that prepares children for the
 
future with the skills and knowledge that empower them to be successful in the 
changing world around them. John Baldwin is a community of learners, where children, teachers, and parents grow, and facilita
te each 
child to reach his/her potential.
 
 
There is
 
mutual respect among teachers, students, parents, and staff. Our community respects and values diversity, and this is taught 
and 
modeled. John Baldwin offers an environment that is supportive, interactive, nurturing, caring and safe; both physically and 
e
motionally. 
Teachers, students, parents, and staff understand the need for all members of the community to feel encouraged, valued and ad
mired. 
We strive for this environment daily.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by 
state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are re
quired to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is
 
to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For mo
re information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact th
e school principal or the district office.

education po
pulation and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are
 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students an
d staff is a primary concern of John Baldwin Elementary School. The school welcomes visitors, but asks all visitors to sign i
n at the 

disruptions.
 
 
John Baldwin Elementary School regularly holds safety drills to prepare our campus and staff for the event of a major emergen
cy. The safety of each 
person on our campus is of the utmost importance. In case of a school
-
wide disaster please not
e the following:
 
 
The school will use the automated phone calling system to call each household and provide them with as much information as po
ssible 
-
 
including specific 
instructions on picking up students.
 
 
Given that in an actual emergency (earthquake, 
flood, fire, power failure, or freeway disaster), phone lines may not be operable, please plan on using 
the following pick
-
up procedures:
 
 
Our Student Release Area will be located at the Dick King Field entrance on Brookside Drive. Parents should 
remain off campus and access the Student 
Release Area via the Dick King Field. To ensure the safety of your student, NO student will be released to any individual unl
ess that individual is on the 
student's Emergency Card AND is able to show identification.
 
This includes parents, relatives, friends and neighbors. Students will ONLY be released 
through the Student Release Area.
 
 
Please walk to the Student Release Area or park on neighboring streets to avoid congestion at the front entrance of the campu
s. This 
area needs to be 
reserved for emergency vehicles.
 
 
Keep your student's Emergency Card updated. Remember, no student will be released to any person NOT on the Emergency card.
 
 
Inform those on your student's Emergency card that they will need to have IDENTIFIC
ATION with them to have a student released to their care.
 
 
Talk to your student about what YOU plan to do in the event of a major emergency.
 
 
Know that your student's safety is our #1 priority!
 
 
If it is necessary to relocate our students due to an emergency,
 
the school district will provide buses and you will be notified of their location. The default 
location is Osage Park/Charlotte Wood Middle School.
 
 
Our Safety plan is reviewed and revised on a regular basis. Updates will be communicated to the John Baldwi
n community.
 
 
Fire and disaster drills are conducted monthly throughout the school year. Earthquake and active shooter drills are practiced
 
regularly. The school site 
safety plan was reviewed with staff members on September of 2018 and is continually revis
ed throughout the year.

The San Ramon Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a 
comprehensive, inclusive model of professional development for all staff. Our high 
quality professional development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy and in
structional strategies. 
In 2012
-
13, we establish
ed district
-
wide K
-
12 Task Forces in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along with targeted professional 
development offerings. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and t
h
e Silicon Valley Math 
Initiative. Both organizations are highly respected and have strong ties to the development and implementation of the CCSS an
d professional learning 
offerings.
 
 
These learning experiences are supported with on
-
site coaching provided by
 
a team of instructional coaches who work and train together. The coaches 
received certification as Common Core trainers through the Leadership and Learning Center. They provide one
-
to
-
one coaching, team and grade level 
coaching, whole school professional 
development, in addition to targeted cross
-
grade level, cross
-
discipline professional development sessions. These 
trainings connect to every aspect of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
formative assessm
ent for 
learning, and lesson design.
 
 
In addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach
-
led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting. 
These cohorts are both semester
-
long and yearlong and are fo
cused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for 
Innovators to Problem Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously.
 
 
We ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher I
nduction Project (formerly known as BTSA). Our summer intensive 
trainings along with on
-
going staff development days and release day trainings deeply align with the needs of our individual schools and our Framewor
k 
for Excellence: Supporting Students and t
heir Learning; Supporting Staff and their Work.
 
 
Under the leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to d
eepen their content 
knowledge, strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve t
heir assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of responsibility. As a result, every 
staff member helps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the district as a w
hole is enhanced.
