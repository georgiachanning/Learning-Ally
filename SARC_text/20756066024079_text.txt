By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

the option to take an advanced Math course or Spanish Class at Minarets High School, if the student qualifies
.
 
 
A Spring Valley graduate will possess a sense of dignity and self
-
respect in having acquired:
 
*The skills necessary to succeed academically
 
*Social skills enabling one to appreciate individual differences and cultural and ethnic diversity
 
*Problem solvi
ng skills which allow one to confidently and competently analyze information and/or situations and 
formulate wise decisions for the benefit of self and others
 
*Citizenship skills which reflect patriotism and a commitment to family, community, and global re
sponsibility
 
*Inter

We believe that the school should be a safe and positive learning environment where every child has the 
opportunity to 
reach their maximum potential.  Spring Valley is a place where high character traits are taught and modeled daily.  The 
learning climate is set where respect and equal opportunity prevail and students are appreciated as individuals.  Spring 
Valley follows a Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports mode. Spring Valley Warriors R.O.C.K. (Respect,

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Spring Valley School was originally constructed in 1889. The two buildings were built in 1965 and 1977 respectively, and 
modernized in 2004. The school is situated on 5.65 acres and span approximately 12,000 square feet. F
acilities are 
comprised of two permanent buildings providing eight classrooms, a library, a multipurpose room, as well as 
administrative offices. The playground has grass ball fields, black top areas for basketball and volleyball with areas for 
swings, sli
des, and climbing equipment. The facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample classroom 
and playground space. The chart displays the most recent facilities inspection.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
The principal works daily with the custodial sta
ff of one full
-
time person to ensure that the cleaning of the school is 
maintained to provide for a clean and safe school.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors a

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
T
he percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Spring Valley School greatly benefits from its supportive parents who support school activities and fundraisers throughout 
the year. The school has a strong base of parent volunteers who help in the classrooms. Pa
rents are also welcome and 
encouraged to join the Parents Club. The Parents Club raises funds for many programs, buys many things, and provides 
support to the staff. The parents also have an opportunity to be apart of the School Site Council an the Distric
t Advisory 
Committee.  A parent survey is given once a year as well.
 
 
The school website and Facebook page are updated with current events.  Parents and students have access to teacher

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Spring Valley School. The school is in compliance with all laws, rules, 
and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and State earthquake standards. The sc

includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. The School Site Safety plan is reviewed and updated 
yearly by the School Safety Committee. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a monthly basis thr
oughout the school 
year. Earthquake drills are twice a year. Lockdown drills are held twice a year. Students are supervised before and after 
school by certificated staff, classified staff and principal, and classified staff supervise students during lunch.
 
Certificated 
and Classified staff help with supervision during lunch and break periods. There is a designated area for student drop off 
and pick up. Visitors are required to come through the school office and sign in.
 
 
In 1998, the Comprehensive Safety Pl
an was developed by the District in consultation with local law enforcement in order 
to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997. The plan provides students and staff a means to ensure a safe and orderly learning 
environment. Components of the Comprehensive Saf
ety Plan include child abuse reporting procedures, teacher 
notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress from 
school, sexual harassment policies, and dress code guidelines. The school revie
ws the plan by December of each year and 
updates it as needed. The plan was last updated and reviewed with school staff in December 2019. All revisions were 
communicated to both the classified and certificated staff. It was approved by the Chawanakee Unifi
ed School District 
Board of Trustees on January 14, 2020. An updated copy of the plan is available to the public at the school and district 
offices.
