Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Lincoln Elementary School is a student
-
centered school that strategically and creatively meets the needs of 
the whole 
child so each child will have tools, skills, and agency to affect change in their own lives and their communities.
 
 
We are a Full Service Community School with a heartfelt commitment to providing a safe and welcoming school 
environment with a cle
ar, well
-
resourced and rigorous student achievement program addressing the full range of student 
needs. Our PBIS program ensures a positive school climate, with the guiding principle of Lincoln Lion PRIDE: Patience, 
Respect, Integrity, Determination and Em
pathy as our "core values." Lincoln Elementary School is located off of Harbour 
Way in Richmond's Iron Triangle, north of highway 580 and east of the Richmond Parkway in the midst of a wonderful and 
supportive community. In order to best serve our students
, Lincoln has put several programs in place in order to boost 

Elementary Team joins parents and the community with the mantra that "
It Takes a Village!" to ensure academic success 
for all of our students. We support the connections between the school and community (home visits, counselors, regular 
parent meetings, etc.) to address specific areas of need.
 
 
To ensure progress of our stud
ents in terms of their academic growth, grade level teams of teachers collaborate to provide 
a rigorous and effective program, ensuring that all students are learning targeted standards through frequent assessment 
and action plans for re addressing gaps in
 
student learning. RTI is in place with teachers working with small groups of 
students in the classroom based on their level of intervention 
-
 
we call this program WIN: "What I Need." We use 
Accelerated Reader for students in grades 3
-
6 to track their read
ing level progress, this provides students with a reading 
level (fluency and comprehension are assessed). All teachers have leveled libraries in their classrooms and the school 
library is currently leveled. Students access our libraries on an on
-
going basi
s at their targeted reading level in order to 
rapidly improve reading skills.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools ar
e clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school uses 
the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order 
are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The school personnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a c
lean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievem
ent (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternat
e Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement 
standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the
 
University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year
 
2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of the School Site Safety Plan is to provide a unified template for school sites to respond and recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the disruption of normal school operations.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan guid
es a coordinated school staff response to an emergency, disaster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may devel
op over time and those that may occur without warning.
 
 
The objectives of the School Site Safety Plan are as follows:
 
1.
 
Protect the safety and welfare of students, school staff, and visitors.
 
2.
 
Provide for a safe and coordinated response to emergencies.

Teachers collaborate weekly in their grade level or in their grade level band (supergroup) to conduct an analysis of 
standards
-
based student assessments, monitor progress within the site Theories of Action, as well as a lesson plan.
 
During these meetings, teachers focus on student data and set goals for improvements in achievement based on 
researched based instructional practices. Professional development is responsive to the professional needs identified in 
the collaboration time, a
nd our site Professional Learning Plan is continually being updated to reflect teacher learning 
needs. Our learning is focused around the District Roadmap 2022, and our own site Theories of Action for Math, RLA, 
Climate, and ELD. In addition to strengtheni
ng the reading/language arts and math instructional practices in the 
classrooms and school wide, there is a strong focus on personalized learning through the 1 to 1 tablet initiative. Our Math 
Theory of Action places a strong emphasis on self
-
directed lear
ning with Khan Academy and Extra Math that provide 
progress
-
monitoring assessments.
 
 
Teachers and other staff are provided with both on and off
-
site professional development in all standards based 
curriculum content areas. Beyond the content areas, profess
ional development is provided in English Language 
Development, differentiated instruction and educational technology. In addition, training is made available in classroom 
management and the effective use of assessment data in meeting the needs of all stude
nts. A primary goal of professional 
development is ensuring that all students are served by skilled, highly qualified teachers and that teachers are supported 
by strong, knowledgeable instructional leaders.
