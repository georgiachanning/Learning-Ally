About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Unde
r the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific acti
vities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For addition
al information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Most of the school's repairs and maintenan
ce projects are 
performed by the

or district maintenance staff, based upon the nature of the situation. Day and evening custodians work closely as a te
am and with the principal for routine 
maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events preparations. The principal and day custodian communicate daily to di
scuss campus cleaning 
needs and safety concerns. Every morning before school begins, the cust
odian and principal inspect facilities for safety hazards, graffiti, and other 
conditions that require removal prior to students and staff entering school grounds. School safety and cleanliness are the cu

strongly emphasized a

for general campus maintenance. The day custodian checks restrooms twice a day as a proactive measure in keeping facilities w
ell stocked, safe, and 
sanitary. The evening custodians are responsible for thorough cleaning of classrooms, o

the district office to perform general maintenance of landscaping, gardening, sports fields, and irrigation systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

All curriculum and instructional improvement activities at Santa Ana Unified School District are aligned to the Common Core S
tate Standards. Staff 
development concentrations are selected and identified based upon 
student assessment results, LCAP requirements, teacher input, state content 
standards, and professional development surveys.
 
 
All staff development activities at Santa Ana Unified School District are focused on increasing student learning and proficie
ncy. 
During the school year, 
our school sponsored two days of staff development. Staff training topics at Walker Elementary included: Academic Language, M
AP (Measures of 
Academic Progress), Collaborative conversations, DIBELS, AVID strategies, Math inservice (H
abits of Practice) and ST Math refresher course. 
 
 
Santa Ana Unified School District offers supplemental training and support for new and ongoing program implementation. Traini
ng activities take place 
throughout the school year, after school, and during th
e summer and generally focus on curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies. During the 
2018
-
19 school year, district training opportunities focused on the following:
 

 
Think Central
 

 
Benchmark Advance (ELA)
 

 
Gifted and Talented Education
 

 
MAP (Measures 
of Academic Progress)
 

 
AVID
 

 
Data Analysis and Using Data to Drive Instruction
 

 
Irvine Math Project
 

 
SIPPS
 
 
Teachers at Walker receive the training twice a month if available. The Principal and TOSA meet with the ILT (Instructional L
eadership Team) and review 
student data to decide on what type of staff development is most beneficial to our teachers. 
 
 
At the 
district level, new teachers and teachers not yet fully credentialed are supported by peer coaching and extensive staff devel
opment. The TIPS 
Induction Program (Teacher Induction and Professional Support) is a state
-
approved program that offers additional 
support and assistance to newly 
credentialed teachers. All new teachers are assigned to a Support Provider (mentor teacher) and provided individualized suppo
rt over a two
-
year period. 
More information about the TIPS Induction Program is available at www.sa
usdtips.org.
 
 
To support veteran teachers as well as new teachers to the district, Santa Ana Unified School District offers Peer Assistance
 
and Review (PAR) which is 
easily defined as teachers helping teachers. Experienced and knowledgeable veteran teacher
s, referred to as Consulting Teachers, provide ongoing 
assistance to teachers who need to improve their instructional skills, classroom management strategies, subject knowledge, an
d/or related aspects of 
their teaching performance.
