About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

Instructional Materials
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Lydiksen Elementary School are 
currently aligned to the California State Standards. Instructional materials 
are selected from the state's most recent list of standards
-
based materials and adopted by the State Board of Education. The district follows the State 
Board of Education's six
-
ye
ar adoption cycle for core content materials (English/language arts, math, science, and social science).
 
 
On Tuesday, September 24, 2019, the Pleasanton Unified School District's Board of Trustees held a public hearing to certify t
he extent to which textbo
oks 
and instructional materials have been provided to students.  The Board of Trustees adopted Resolution 2019
-
2020.004 which certifies as required by 
Education Code ยง60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional materials were provided to all students, inclu
ding English learners, in the district to the extent 
that each pupil has a textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient text
books and instructional materials 
were provided to each student, including Eng
lish learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with the cycles and content 
of the curriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English/language arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, 
districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materials used for their visual/performing
 
arts curricula. During the 2019
-
20 school year, Pleasanton Unified School District provided each student, including English learne
rs, enrolled in a 
visual/performing arts class with a textbook or instructional materials to use in class and to take home. These materials com
plied with the state's content 
standards and curriculum frameworks.
