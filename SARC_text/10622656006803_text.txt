About 
the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Lo
cal Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities t
o address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional informat
ion about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of Californi
a Office of Public School Construction. The results of this survey are available at the KCUSD Business Office.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are provided w
ith a clean, safe, 
and 
functional learning environment. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by spe
aking with the school 
principal.
 
 
Lincoln Elementary School has 18 classrooms, a multi
-
purpose room, a library and an administr
ation building. The main campus was built in 1957. 
Additional relocatable classrooms were constructed in 1995 and a library was constructed in 2005. In 2019, additional lightin
g was added to the parking 
lot and the student drop off area improved.
 
 
District
 
maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed. A wor
k order process 
is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
The Director of Ma
intenance, Custodial Supervisor, and the site principals work cooperatively with the custodial staff to develop cleaning sche
dules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provide
s state matching funds on a dollar for dollar basis to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this in
cludes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical syste
ms, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

education population and the Californi
a Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are

hievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental 
Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parent involvement and communication are essen
tial to our school's success. Lincoln Elementary School continually strives to involve parents by 
exchanging information that helps parents understand and support school programs and by providing opportunities for parent pa
rticipation in school 
activities.
 
 
There are numerous and varied opportunities for parent involvement. Parents attend school functions and parent visitation day
s, participate in parent
-
teacher conferences, assist with fundraisers, chaperone field trips, attend parenting classes, participa
te in Parent Teacher Club (PTC) meetings, volunteer 
in classrooms and at school events such as; Family Fun Night, Ice Cream Fridays, and Pastries with Parents.  Parents may also
 
serve on advisory committees 
and leadership teams, including Parent Teacher Cl
ub (PTC), English Learner Advisory Council (ELAC), District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC), 
School Site Council (SSC), and District Advisory Committee (DAC).
 
 
This year we are involving parents in Parenting Classes, also known as Parent Academy
, which offer opportunities to learn English, computer skills, 
parenting strategies, positive discipline supports and Common Core curriculum.  Lincoln offers parent  reading and math cente
red parent nights for 
parents to learn and interact with Common Core
 
lessons and materials, as well as Parent STEM Nights that include Science, Technology, Engineering, and 
Math strategies. Lincoln also offers Gymboree classes for parents, infants, and toddlers.
 
 
Home and school communication is always in a bilingual forma
t and is enhanced through monthly newsletters, parent
-
teacher conferences, the 
student/parent handbook, the school website, student report cards, the school marquee, telephone communication system and oth
er regular 
communication efforts. Translation is reg
ularly provided. In addition, parent education classes and workshops are offered regularly in both English and 
Spanish, such as Family Math Night Workshops, and "Puente a la Tecnologia," (Bridge to Technology) a computer
-
based program providing chrome
-
book
s and internet access to English Learners and their parents as a tool to support their language acquisition.
 
 
Parents who would like more information on how to become involved may contact Principal Gabriela Cazares at (559) 305
-
7240, or ask for assistance 
in 
the school office.

State Prior
ity: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Lincoln Elementary School. Before, during, and after school, the campus 
is monitored by assigned 
staff and all gates onto campus are locked during school hours with the exclusion of the main entrance. Al
l visitors must sign in at the office and wear 
appropriate identification while on campus.
 
 
The comprehensive school safety plan is designed to assist in preparing for emergencies, managing emergency response efforts,
 
and maintaining a safe 
school 
environment. The plan requires identification of security needs, development of prevention and intervention techniques, evalu
ation of physical 
facilities, and communication with staff and students. Components of the plan include: child abuse reporting proc
edures, procedures for teacher 
notification of dangerous pupils, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress from school, sexual ha
rassment policies, and 
suspension and expulsion policies. The safety plan is reviewed annually, upda
ted as needed, and fully compliant with federal and state regulations. The 
plan was last reviewed/updated and discussed with staff in the Fall of 2019. An updated copy is available to the public at th
e school office.
 
 
The school's disaster preparedness pla
n includes steps for ensuring the safety of students and staff during a disaster. Emergency preparedness drills are 
conducted monthly and the school staff is appropriately trained. A detailed binder is located in the Lincoln office that cons
ists of all req
uired safety 
components.
