By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

-
level expectations in English Language Arts, Mathematics, 
Science, and Social Studies by increasing each year by five percent on California's statewide student assessment system. 
Student academic progress is monitored 
throughout the school year using interim assessments in English Language Arts 
and Mathematics. Data received from these assessments are carefully analyzed by grade level teams and the support 
staff, and decisions are made to positively impact student achie

-

Title I, GATE, Special Education, PBIS and participation in the Montclair Community Collaborative. Ramona has other 
special
-
purpose funding which is used for a wide variety of projects to support inst
ructional programs, staff development 
and other school improvement efforts.
 
 
Ramona is designated as a GATE Academy. This entails an accelerated learning community which offers a specialty in the 
area of the communication arts and selfcontained GATE classe
s in grades three through six. Identified GATE teachers 
receive training in methodologies specific to the needs of GATE students, and students are challenged through a 
differentiated curriculum. Many opportunities exist for students to refine their communi
cation skills including a student
-
created newspaper, the use of iPads, blogging, pen pals, classroom presentations, and annual talent show and Writing 
Gala to exhibit and celebrate student work.
 
During the 2019
-
2020 school year Ramona earned the California

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Ramona (Communication Arts Academy) was 
opened in 1968 as OMSD's 33rd facility. The permanent school facility 
includes 2 kindergarten rooms, 20 regular classrooms, an administration building with a staff room, a library, 4 small 
ancillary rooms and a Multi
-
Purpose Room. As a result of past grow 
in enrollment, the school now has a total of 11 
portables on site in addition to the twenty
-
two original full
-
sized classrooms. Ramona (Communication Arts Academy) 
features a large campus with ample playground facilities including substantial grass and bla
cktop areas. The upper
-
grade 
playground has a safety
-
compliant play apparatus with wood
-
fiber fill. Several years ago a new Pre
-
kinder/Kinder 
playground was replaced providing a new safety play apparatus. The school strives to keep the campus clean, safe a
nd 
well
-
maintained at all times. A periodic review of cleaning schedules and methods allows the custodial staff to place 
priority on cleaning classrooms and removing rocks, glass, and debris from play areas in a timely manner without 
neglecting other dutie
s. Any graffiti that is found is removed immediately. The school has implemented a clean restroom 
policy, which includes regular visual checks and frequent cleaning.
 
 
All restrooms are thoroughly cleaned daily and 100% of the toilets are functioning. Stude
nts are regularly reminded that 
they are expected to respect and care for school property. Expectations for restroom use are posted outside of the 
restroom facilities. The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provid
es state 
matching funds to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building 
components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior exterior 
painti
ng, and floor systems. Each year the district makes the maximum district match required by the State to fully 
participate in the deferred maintenance program.

During the 2007
-
2008 school year, Ramona saw the completion of construction of the new multi
-
pur
pose building. 
Electrical service upgrades and a complete modernization were completed in June 2008. Telephone and internet 
connections are available in every classroom, and the district has installed wireless internet connection accessible 
throughout the 
entire school site. All classrooms are equipped with SmartBoards, computers, and printers. A perimeter 
fence controls access to the school to ensure the safety of both staff and students. Future improvement plans have been 
prepared and are regularly review
ed and updated to ensure they remain in compliance with state and local regulations 
and they will be of the greatest benefit to the school when implemented.
 
 
To promote safety, Ramona is a closed campus; gates are closed during the school day and visitors 
must enter through 
the main office to sign in at the front desk prior to entering school premises.  Visitors must present their California ID 
badges and staff must present their district badge through our RAPTOR system.  Signage has been placed at all gate
s 
directing visitors to check in at the office.  All staff members have been provided with district ID badges.  Ramona offers 
student supervision before school, during school and after school.  Supervision in the mornings is done by administrative 
team, su
pport team, and proctors.  Recess duty supervision is offered by administration team, teachers, and proctors.  
Adult proctors supervise lunch and lunch recess.  After school supervision is offered by administration team, support staff 
as well as teachers.
 
 
In 2010
-
2011 Ramona had two thin
-
book laptop carts formatted for student use and purchased two additional carts in 
2011
-
2012. During the 2013
-
2014 school year, Ramona implemented an iPad pilot program in both a primary and upper
-
grade classrooms in additi
on to approximately seven iPads for staff use. Additionally, Ramona was provided with laptops 
in a portable cart to assist the school in piloting Smarter Balance assessments for students in grades 3
-
6. Over the last few 
years, additional technology has bee
n purchased. Currently, the technological device ratio for students in grades 2
-
6 is 1:1 
and is 1:2 in grades K
-
1.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.
