By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

is the compr
ehensive plan that has been developed by the District and its Committee. It serves as the blueprint that will

Cleaning Process
 
The site administration works daily with the custodial staff to ensure that t
he cleaning of the school is maintained to 
provide for a clean and safe school. The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the 
district. A summary of these standards are available at the district office for review.
 
 
Main
tenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and work orders are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used (School Dude 
-
 
CMMS) to ensure efficient service and highest 
p
riority are given to emergency repairs.
 
 
While reviewing this report, please note that even minor discrepancies are reported in the inspection process. The items 
noted in the table have been corrected or are in the process of remediation either during the

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

lated by taking the total number of 
students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the
 
total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3
-
Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or 
less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Mill Valley Middle School. The school is always in compliance with all 
laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to safety standards. It has a Comprehensive Schoo
l Safety Plan that includes 
strategies and programs to address a) child abuse reporting procedures; b) disaster procedures; c) policies regarding 
actions leading to suspension and/or expulsion; d) procedures to notify teachers of dangerous pupils; e) sexua
l and 
gender
-
based harassment policies; f) school
-
wide dress code; g) procedures for safe ingress and egress of pupils; h) rules 
and procedures on school discipline; i) bullying and harassment policies; j) suicide prevention measures; k) school 
counseling;
 
and l) school resource officer. The plan is reviewed and updated annually by the School Site Council.
 
 

professionals in search and rescue
 
and first aid. Fire, disaster, and lockdown drills are conducted on a regular basis 
throughout the school year. All certificated staff participated in a table
-
top disaster drill on October 23rd, 2019 in 
preparation for our school
-
wide full
-
scale disaster 
drill on November 20th, 2019. This drill involved simulations of injured, 
missing and trapped students, as well as parents picking up their children from student release. Our local fire department 
was on
-
site to provide feedback on search and rescue and co
mmunication protocols.
 
 
Discipline & Climate for Learning
 
The Mill Valley Middle School community works together to provide a safe, caring environment where uniqueness and 
differences are respected and all children are supported to reach their full potenti
al. Staff and parents alike are committed 
to a tradition of academic excellence and social skill development. Our schools basic behavioral expectations are: Be kind 
and respectful, be honest and truthful, be safe and responsible.  When students make poor d
ecisions or are involved in 
actions that break school rules or Ed Code, we first determine whether the incident would be best addressed through 
restorative practices or a combination of traditional consequences coupled with restorative practices.  We belie
ve that 
students should learn from their mistakes and not only serve a consequence without any reflection about the incident 
they were involved in.
 
 
Parents provide strong support to all aspects of the school program and play an integral part in the education of the 
children. They are active partners who contribute time and expertise to the school in order to support classroom programs 
and special even
ts. A high percentage of families volunteer their time in one or more school projects.
 
 
We will provide our students with a secure, caring, and challenging environment along with the knowledge, skills, and love 
of learning necessary for them to become succ
essful adults.
