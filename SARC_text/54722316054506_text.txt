Description
 
 
Principal's Message
 
Maple Elementary School is privileged to serve over 650 Kindergarten through fifth grade students. 
Our theme is "Be an A.C.E!" (Academics + Character = Excellence). Our staff is dedicated to the 
pursuit of academic excellence and positive character develop
ment for ALL students. We stress the 
"value of work" and the "value respect" in order to guide students toward success. We provide an 
enriching instructional program and a supportive learning environment to form the basis for 
lifelong personal growth.
 
 
Sta
ff members at Maple School encourage parents to be involved in their child's education. We 
encourage parents to participate in Parent/Teacher Conferences and average over 95% 
participation. Parents may help make decisions at school by participating in the 
Parent/Teacher 
Organization (PTO), School Site Council (SSC), English Learners Advisory Council (ELAC) and/or our 
annual survey.
 
 
Maple School also has several Family Nights planned that offer parents and families opportunities 
to interact with one another
 
and have fun. Examples of the Family Nights are the Fall Harvest 
Festival, making Gingerbread Houses in December, a Valentine Social, and a spring skate night. 
Maple School also sponsors a beginning of the year Meet and Greet, Back
-
to
-
School Night and an 
Open House.  Parent Coffee Clubs are also offered to parents throughout the year and cover various 
topics.
 
 
Maple School follows a Comprehensive School Safety Plan to ensure the safety of all students, staff 
members and visitors on the Maple campus.  The s
afety drills are reviewed with staff and students 
and practiced monthly.  After the opening of school, all school gates are locked and visitors must 
enter the school through the office.  At that time, a visitors pass must be obtained before any guests 
are 
allowed into a classroom or onto the campus.  The school safety plan is reviewed regularly and 
input for improvement is given from members of the SSC/ELAC.
 
 
Professional development is given to all teachers, where improving instruction is the focus. 
Teache
rs also have the opportunity to improve their instruction by meeting as a grade
-
level or 
crossgrade to discuss best instructional practices.  Grade levels also meet regularly to analyze 
student data and discuss instructional strategies that are successful.
  
When needed, demonstration 
lessons by fellow teachers, district resource teachers, or Maple School's principal are also utilized. 
We believe that the staff development offered to staff has been an integral component of our 
growth and success of moving al
l students toward proficiency.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Maple School is a safe place for students to learn and grow. Our school has a Safe School Plan that is in place and updated y
early by the School Safety 
Committee. Evacuation drills are 
scheduled on a regular basis to ensure that staff and students know what to do in an emergency. A Cal
-
OSHA 
representative attends monthly meetings and provides updates to staff on safety and health issues. In addition to these progr
ams, adequate supervisio
n 
is provided before school, during break/recess, at lunch, and after school, and is noted on the school's duty schedule. All s
chool district facilities are 
supportive of teaching and learning. Classrooms are clean and orderly and provide a safe learning e
nvironment reflective of student work and current 
curriculum. We have a school cafeteria that provides students with a breakfast and lunch program and is used as a multipurpos
e facility for large
-
scale 
programs and meetings. Our library provides students w
ith supplemental reading materials and provides additional educational resources. We take pride 
in our well
-
maintained buildings and landscaping. The Tulare City School District employs skilled professionals to ensure a safe and clea
n environment 
throughou
t the school year. Students, staff, and parents are committed to keeping our campus clean and litter
-
free. The Tulare City School District 
provides ongoing maintenance, and routine and major repairs for all permanent and portable buildings to guarantee all
 
schools in the district are in good 
working order and condition. Additionally, school restroom facilities for pupils are maintained so they are functional and me
et local hygiene standards 
generally applicable to public facilities, including operational to
ilets and sinks in all restrooms. The district has established a facilities inspection system 
to ensure that all school buildings meet the standards listed above. The school grounds, buildings, and restrooms (100% worki
ng) are kept clean, safe, 
and regular
ly maintained. Maple has a morning custodian and two evening custodians. The morning custodian's work hours are from 6:30 A.M
. to 3:30 
P.M., and the evening custodian's hours are from 12:30 P.M. to 9:00 P.M. Custodians are regularly monitored and evaluated
 
by the building principal and 
director of custodians to ensure that Maple is safely maintained and cleaned. In addition to the assigned school custodians, 
the district has a general 
maintenance crew that takes care of the more technical repairs (plumbing,
 
heating, cooling, gas, electrical, carpeting, painting, major repairs, and so on). 
At times, the district will hire an independent contractor to handle repairs that may be beyond the scope of the district's r
esources. Repairs are made on 
an ongoing basis.
 
The district has a work order repair procedure that begins with the school principal referring needed repairs that cannot be 
taken care 
of by the site custodians to the district superintendent. The superintendent assigns the repairs to the maintenance dir
ector who, in turn, assigns the 
work out to the different maintenance specialists. Work orders are completed on a timely basis.

State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical
