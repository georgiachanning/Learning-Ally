By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Newcastle Elementary School and District, located at the gateway to the foothills, first opened to 44 first through eighth
-
grade students in 1865. Although the building location has moved three times and enrollment for the
 
elementary school 
has grown to over 400 students, it is still a small and close
-
knit community school, serving transitional kindergarten 
through eighth
-
grade district and charter students on the same campus and in the same classes.
 
 
Motto:
 
"Newcastle Knights 

 
Gems of the Foothills, Shining Above the Rest"
 
 
Vision:
 
Newcastle School is the cornerstone of a lifelong community of learners where students, staff, families, and community 
work together to ensure that students are successfully prepa
red for rigorous higher education coursework, career 
challenges, and a globally competitive workforce. Students are prepared to the highest level of social, moral, and academic 
development.
 
 
Mission:
 
The Newcastle Elementary School District is committed to
 
work in partnership with the home and community. Our 
students will be provided with an academic program designed to develop the 21st Century skills necessary to become 
active and effective global citizens. Our students will be supported in a safe, positiv
e learning environment that meets all 

 
 
Newcastle Elementary/Charter School enjoys the reputation of having a very strong academic and social program with 
capable, caring staff and administration. The school provides for academic achievement through a rigorous curricular 
program focused on the common core standards and rich in arts and technology.  In the Newcastle school community, we 
believe that every chi
ld can be successful, but not necessarily in the same way or on the same day and we work together 
to create opportunities for success for all students.
 
 
Students receive differentiated instruction daily through flex time in the four core areas. Each class 
has the benefit of an 
instructional assistant to support instruction and small groups during this time. All students in K
-
7 receive weekly 
instruction in Spanish and music.  Students who qualify may participate in additional activities such as after
-
school
 
sports, 
band, choir, STEM classes, leadership, yearbook, history club, science/adventure club, and among others, Odyssey of the 
Mind. Newcastle Elementary/Charter School recognizes the social and academic value of a positive environment. A school
-
wide stu
dent recognition program honors exemplary student behavior and citizenship through the Stellar Knight program, 
Student of the Month, monthly character traits, and academic excellence.

CHP, Scouting, Newcastle Fire Protection District and the Newcastle Community and Business Associations. Parents and 
community members who wish to participate in school or district committees, leadership teams, schoo

A focus on safety has given Newcastle a campus that is free of violence, drugs, and crime. The Comprehensive School 
Safety Plan (CSSP) addresses all components of SB 187. The Site 
Safety Committee reviews the CSSP and conducts school 
safety inspections annually. Safety drills are held monthly and evacuation procedures are communicated to parents, The 
school staff explains policies about safety, behavior expectations, bullying and ha
rassment annually to students and 
parents. Along with the annual February review and refinement of the Comprehensive Safety Plan, the Safe Schools Plan 
was also reviewed, refined and Board approved in Spring of 2018 by the School Site Council and the Newca
stle School 
Board of Trustees.
