DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides repor
ts for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly
 
accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a 
works
tation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a 
workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
This school has 23 classrooms (including four modular classrooms), a multipurpose room, a library, and an administration buil
din
g. The main campus was 
built in 1938. Classrooms were added in 1949 and 1963. A new restroom building was constructed in 2001.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed 
in a timely manner. An 
automated work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. I

membership in Joint Powers Agreement (JPA) property and liability collaboration p

staff to develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
During the summer of 201
3, the main building and one wing of classrooms were repainted. The lunch shelter outside the newly painted buildings was 
repaired. New sprinkler pipes were installed and then sod was laid.
 
 
Increased security fencing was installed during the summer of 201
4 which requires all people to enter through the front.  The original garage in front of 
the school was removed and filled in with grass.
 
 
Upgrades to the bandwidth are ongoing as the need increases each year. This gives improved internet 
connection throughout the campus as we move 
into online assessments.
 
 
This last year, the entire campus was re
-
painted and a School marquee was added to the front of the school.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Invo
lvement (School Year 2019
-

Loma Vista is fortunate to have a very active and dedicated Parent Teacher Association (PTA). The PTA encourages parents to b
ecome PTA members and 
volunteers. Through a variety of fund
-
raising activities, the PTA supports our 
instructional program by underwriting the cost of numerous field trip 
opportunities throughout the year. The PTA has monthly meetings and publishes a monthly newsletter in coordination with the p
rincipal that is sent 
home in English and Spanish.  Phone mes
sages, emails, and/or text messages are sent home to remind parents of upcoming events. Parents are 
encouraged to participate on social media through ClassDojo, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and the school website.  Parents a
re encouraged to volunteer 
in t
he classroom and/or to chaperone on field trips. Parents are invited to attend the School Site Council (SSC) meetings. In the
 
fall, parents elect 
representatives to this group which is directly involved in developing our school plan and making budgetary de
cisions related to our categorical programs. 
They meet a minimum of five times per school year. District level opportunities are the District Advisory Council (DAC/DELAC)
.  All parents are invited to 
attend the English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) me
etings. The ELAC advises the school regarding programs and services for EL students. ELAC 
meets at least four times per school year to review specific agenda topics, such as EL students' achievement and ELD instruct
ional programs. Our school 
has also most 
recently added a community liaison to our staff.  We are honored to have someone to serve as a parent representative.
 
 
All parents are invited to Coffee with the Principal meetings. All parents are invited to Back
-
to
-
School Night, Open House, parent
-
teache
r conferences, 
Founders Day, Harvest Festival and our Holiday Program each year.
 
Parent workshops are provided throughout the year in English and Spanish. Parents are able to participate in such classes as 
Parent Institute for Quality 
Education, Family Sto
ries, and Nutrition classes. Parents meet weekly on Wednesday mornings to help prepare our weekly communication folders.  
Parents also have access to the school library after school.  Through a partnership with Whittier Union High School our paren
ts/commun
ity are able to 
attend on site English/Civics Classes to assist in becoming citizens and learning how to communicate in English.  Through a p
artnership with Helpline 
Youth Counseling our parents are able to attend parent classes with such topics as Parenti
ng, Bullying and Suicide Prevention.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion ra
tes; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
As required by state law, the school maintains a detailed safety plan. The safety plan was last fully updated in February 28,
 
2019 and the emergency plan 
is monitored 
monthly to assure available staff is assigned to emergency response positions. All personnel is trained in emergency procedur
es and students 
take part in regularly scheduled emergency drills. Food, water, medical and other emergency supplies are updated an
nually to ensure each campus is 
ready to respond in the event of an emergency or disaster.   Loma Vista participated in the California ShakeOut last October 
and practiced school 
emergency response with a disaster scenario developed by the principal. Each y
ear in October the emergency plan is updated to reflect new staff and 
any new concerns.  The plan and jobs are reviewed with the new teams and practiced on the day of the ShakeOut.  Our emergency
 
supplies are now 
stored in an emergency bin which includes a
ll the food, water, medical and emergency supplies.  This includes the students individual emergency bags.  
The school is carefully monitored before, during and after school hours. Break periods and lunch are supervised by school per
sonnel. The school is s
ecured 
with security fencing. Check
-
in and check
-
out procedures are also strictly enforced. The School maintains constructive relationships with law enforcement 
agencies to ensure the safety of all students, staff, and facilities. Furthermore, through Meas
ure W funding (a general obligation bond passed by area 
voters to upgrade school facilities) the school has upgraded communication systems and radio communication is available at al
l times.
