School Description
 
Sierra Vista Elementary is a No Excuses University School, that believes every child should be 
educated in a way that will prepare them for college or career.  We welcome children to a world of 
strong academics and high standards for achievement. In 2019
-
2
020, our staff continues their 
collaborative work to maintain a safe but challenging learning environment. Our mission is one that 
challenges students to reach their full academic potential in a positive and engaging manner, while 
fostering a strong founda
tion of 21st century learning skills and developing responsible citizens. 
Through the use of a rigorous curriculum and engaging learning environments we are targeting 21st 
century skills and embedding the 5 C's
-
 
communication, collaboration, creativity, an
d critical 
thinking, and with our school focus the fifth C
-
 
College/Career Readiness. Our school wide code of 
conduct encourages and rewards students for being safe, responsible, and respectful to all on our 
campus. This code provides support for a strong 
learning environment at Sierra Vista.
 
 
Our staff and specifically our leadership team, continues to work with Innovate Ed. This Professional 
Learning Community (PLC) model, employs sound and effective instructional practices, as well as 
quality materials, 
to ensure that our students receive a well
-
balanced, comprehensive education. 
Our math provides opportunities to meet the rigorous standards students need to access while also 
differentiating our instruction to meet their needs. English Language Learners a
re supported 
through a designated block of English Language Development time at their grade level.  The English 
Language Development Standards assists in applying targeted best practices in our instruction of 
students who are working toward reading profici
ency and mastering English as their second 
language. New staff development training has enhanced classroom experiences for students by 
increasing the role of critical thinking and deepening understanding, in all areas of the curriculum. 
Sierra Vista Elemen
tary School continues to improve on accountability measures.  In our continued 
partnership with Innovate Ed, we are completing cycles of inquiry and improving our data based 
decision making which then leads to our site
-
based professional development. With 
this more 
targeted instructional practice, focused interventions and data analysis, and grade level 
collaboration, our staff is focused on continual improvement.
 
 
Our PTA is also a big part of our school success. We are proud of the many programs they spon
sor 
to benefit our students, including field trips, assemblies, class celebrations, and fundraising efforts.  
Our Positive Behavior Supports and Interventions (PBIS) model, the foundation of our code of 
conduct, has produced a more engaged and serious lear
ning environment for all students. Our after 
school ASES program, sponsored by the Boys and Girls Club of La Habra, serves at
-
risk students 
through support with homework completion, crafts, and play.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is re
quired by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LE
As) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in 
an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should 
contact the school principal or the 
district office.

the extent that each pupil has a 
textbook or 
instructional materials or both to use in class and to take home; and (2) that sufficient textbooks and instructional materia
ls were provided 
to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent wit
h the cycles and content of the 
curriculum frameworks in English/language arts, math, science, and history
-
social science.
 
 
All textbook and support materials are selected from the state's list of approved materials and adopted by the State Board of
 
Educat
ion. Materials 
approved for use are reviewed and a recommendation is made to the Governing Board by a selection committee composed of teache
rs, administrators, 
and parents. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district offi

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Types of Services Funded
 
Sierra Vista School uses various funds to support a variety of services 
aimed at enabling students to meet or exceed standards. Federal Title I 
funds provide opportunities for teachers to participate in staff 
development. In addi
tion, this funding assisted with extra hours for our 
community liaison and other bilingual support staff  to support parent 
communication and further support students academic achievements with 
necessary outside family support.  Federal funding has enabled
 
the school 
site to begin the process of outfitting classrooms with up
-
to
-
date 
technology. In addition, federal funds are budgeted to help employ our 
library technician and other reading support staff, or 
instructional/intervention aides.  Our federally
-
fu
nded S&C dollars support 
our English learners and socioeconomically disadvantaged students by 
providing additional materials to work with students.  Finally, all of those 
federal programs support instructional materials and supplies to support 
the classroo
m.
 
 
Student Council raises funds through a our Campus Store that sells pencils, 
erasers, and other school supplies. These funds are used to support 
student activities such as Buck a Book, prizes for PAWS drawing, and 
awards for good behavior and attendance
. PTA raises funds for field trips, 
assemblies, and family activities, such as family dances, and holiday 
parties.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information 
about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports 
for accountability (e.g., test data, enr
ollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are 
publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Lib
rary). Access to the Internet 
at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, 
the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending on 
availabili
ty), the types of software programs available on a workstation, 
and the ability to print documents.

Each year the District looks at student achievement data along with teacher requests for specific trainings to determine the 
plan for
 
the four Districtwide 
professional development days.  In 2017
-
18 school year, training focused on new ELA adoption, Wonders and Amplify programs.  In 2018
-
2019 training 
focused on new Mathematics adoptions, Bridges and Math Links.  In 2019
-
2020, training 
focused on developing Multi
-
Tiered System of Supports (MTSS).
 
 
In addition to the Districtwide trainings, each site works with a consultant from InnovateEd to develop Cycles of Inquiry aro
und their strategic focus.  
Teacher leaders attend seven days of tra
ining to analyze student data, develop a strategic focus for the year, implement evidence based lessons, and 
analyze student work.  Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSAs) assigned to each site work with all teachers throughout the yea
r during the school da
y 
and during PLC time to support implementation of the strategic focus.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (
School Year 2019
-

We have many ways for parents to participate in the life of our school, and we depend on parents to keep our programs running
 
smoothly. One way for 
parents to become involved is to join our various committees. Parents can join our Scho
ol Site Council, which works with administration to help make 
program and financial decisions. Parents of English Learners are vital as well in the work done alongside of School Site Coun
cil.  Parents are invited to 
participate in our Advisory and Informat
ion meetings held throughout the year (also known as Coffee with the Principal) with a focus on giving parents 
the opportunity to provide the principal input on school issues as well as for the principal to share events and issues of vi
tal interest to our 
parent and 
school community.
 
 
Unique to our school, is our No Excuses University focus. All parents are invited to attend a parent orientation at the begin
ning of the year, so they can 
learn the importance and value of being a No Excuses Parent and how the
y too play a valuable role in their child's success. Continuing with our school 
focus we offer a series of parent academy classes which offers a topic a month ranging from nutrition information, helping wi
th homework, supporting 
your student's education in
to the future, technology, and more.  Check our school website for these parent education opportunities.
 
 
Another role for parents to be active is by volunteering on campus.  Parents can assist  with special projects in the classro
om and/or chaperone on fi
eld 
trips. Parents can also become involved with our Parent Teacher Association (PTA).  PTA helps fund assemblies, field trips, a
nd more through PTA 
fundraisers. The PTA is also integral in planning and providing school community events such as family danc
es, movie nights, family bowling, book fairs 
and carnivals. PTA encourages parents to assist with these endeavors.
 
 
In addition, we work with community partnerships to offer more extended opportunities for learning with parents. Opportunitie
s include but a
re not 
limited to Parent Institute of Quality Education (PIQE),our local counseling services, Gary Center, and more so that parents 
can learn how to navigate the 
education system and prepare their students for the future.

ely notify the of
fice or 
adults on supervision duty.
 
 
Our Safe School Plan is revised annually, just before each school year begins. All staff members are re
-
trained on the plan at our annual Back

to
-
School 
staff meeting. The 2018
