By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Olinda Elementary was built in 1957 and is located in a beautiful residential area of El Sobrante. We are 
surrounded by 
the natural hills of El Sobrante and vast open spaces of the local water district and Kennedy Grove regional park. Our 
students live in the Sherwood Forest, Carriage Hills and other neighboring communities. Our reputation as a rigorous 
academ
ic school with a diverse population has consistently made us a popular choice for parents, who are looking at 
various educational options. Olinda is an ethnically diverse school and that diversity is our strength. Our ethnic make
-
up 
is approximately 24% As
ian, 26% Hispanic, 21% White, 21%, African American, 8% Filipino.
 
Our mission statement provides the framework for the goals and objectives we seek to strive for on a daily basis. Olinda 
provides a safe and supportive environment where all students can dev
elop to their fullest potential academically, 
emotionally and socially. Our goal is to partner with parents and the community to ensure that all students are college 
and career ready, in order to be productive and successful citizens.
 
 
Theory of Action 201

If we foster a culture of learning together by providing teachers with opportunities to share resources and ongoing cross 
grade
-
level collaboration, then we will see the quality of our instruction improve, and we will build the confidence of our 
tea
chers to provide consistent, differentiated, rigorous instruction, which will promote student engagement and 
achievement.
 
 
If we provide multiple, positive opportunities to engage with our families through both social and academic events, then 
we will see

being.
 
If we build a community that promotes college and career readiness through a variety of ongoing learning opportunities, 
then we will model and encourage a g
rowth mindset that will resonate with students as they continue their journey of 
being a lifelong learner.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school us
es 
the Facility Inspection Tool 
(FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that em
ergency repairs are given the highest priority. The school personnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achi
evement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entranc
e to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of the School Site Safety Plan is to provide a unified template for school sites to respond and recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting 
in the disruption of normal school operations.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan guides a coordinated school staff response to an emergency, disaster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site 
Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over time and those that may occur without warning.
 
 
The objectives of the School Site Safety Plan are as follows:
 
1.
 
Protect the safety and welfare of students, school staff, 
and visitors.
 
2.
 
Provide for a safe and coordinated response to emergencies.
 
3.
 

 
4.
 
Enable the District to restore normal conditions with minimal confusion in the shortest time possible.
 
5.
 
Provide for the interface and
 
coordination between sites and the District Emergency Operations Center (DEOC).
 
6.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between the District EOC and the Cities of Richmond, El Cerrito, San 
Pablo, Pinole, Hercules, and Contra Costa County Emergency Oper
ations Center (EOC).
 
7.
 
Provide for the orderly conversion of pre
-
designated District sites to mass care sites, when necessary.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is updated annually.  Our school safety plan was last annually reviewed, updated, 
and discuss
ed with school faculty and a student representative in January 2020.  A copy of the Comprehensive School

Quality instruction and instructional leadership are at the heart of the district's achievement efforts. To ensure this, the 
Academic Support Division engages 
teachers, administrators, and other personnel in ongoing professional development 
focused on improving teaching and learning. Training is provided to principals and other administrators to improve their 
ability to provide strong instructional leadership an
d guide teaching and learning at school sites. The principals, in turn, 
provide support to teachers through staff conferences, opportunities for collaborative study and planning, and individual 
coaching based on ongoing school needs, differentiated instruc
tion, and educational technology. In addition, training is 
made available in classroom management and the effective use of classroom practices, assessment data and teacher data 
teams in meeting the needs of all students. A primary goal of the professional 
development program is ensuring that all 
students are served by skilled, highly qualified teachers and that teachers are supported by strong, knowledgeable 
instructional leaders.
 
 
Professional Development this year is focused on the teacher's interests and
 
needs. The teacher leads in the areas of 
TCRWP, math and technology offer supports and PD's around the work they participating with the district and aligning 
that work with school
-
wide instruction. Teachers will receive training around PBIS with one of th
e district's coaches and 
will have a two
-
day math PD in January and February. Teachers are offered support as needed through the Teacher 
Induction Program and Peer Assistance and Review Program. The Instructional Leadership Team meets monthly to assist 
in 
supporting the instruction by offering training and professional development sessions that focus on the agreed upon 
SMART Goals for our school. Through the review of collaboration logs and data result forms, the Instructional Leadership 
Team assesses the n
eeds addressed and provides further clarification or feedback. Our Instructional Leadership Team will 
use the information from collaborations and data results to help determine future best practices at the school site that 
will monitor and support our scho


will utilize their collaboration time on teaching and l
earning to develop units of study focused on planning, delivery, and 
assessment, with an emphasis on interactive, engaging and inquiry
-
driven lessons. Teachers will create classrooms that 
empower, facilitate learning, impart skills and self
-
esteem. At Olin
da, we see teachers as positive role models that accept 
and respect each student and open the world to them.
