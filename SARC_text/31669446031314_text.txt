About the SARC
 
By February 
1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding F
ormula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and l
ocal priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For addition
al information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Truckee Unified School District better ensures top
-
notch teaching and learning is via high

quality profe
ssional development (PD.) A variety of options are 
available and range from formal

type workshops or seminars and informal

types such as discussions among colleagues, independent reading, observing 
a colleague's lesson or participating in coaching with one
 
of our many Academic Coaches. The frequency of PD varies with the structure and purpose.

and focus of 
professional development sessions, we assess the needs of our students and teachers and review current research to ens

l development for all 
the educators in the Tahoe Truckee Unified School District so that all student
