of Nishimoto Elementary. She brings many years of teaching, coaching, and adminis
trative 
experience in Madera Unified. Our goal is to provide a quality educational program that will ensure 
high levels of learning by all students. The staff has spent time researching and developing a 
curriculum that will prepare your children to become 
life long learners. Changes in curriculum, 
instruction, assessment, decision making, and the use of technology will be implemented in phases. 
Our emphasis has been on building a culture that strives to nurture a community of thinkers, 
learners, and creator
s. The staff is prepared to ensure learners are ready to actively participate in 
a rapidly changing, high technology, and information
-

English Learner Program: All
 

Development) is taught to our English learners for an average of 45 minutes a day. Students are grouped by their language lev
els so that 
instruction can be 
targeted towards their specific areas of need. The emphasis is on oral language, listening, reading, and writing. Teachers 
evaluate students three to four times a year and monitor their progress. The results of these tests help teachers determine w
hat skil
ls 
need to be taught or reviewed.
 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Avail
ability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Madera Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018, and determined that each school within the district had sufficien
t and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or sc
ience lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in th
e classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the 
state are reviewed by all teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priorit

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessme
nts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards,
 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the 
University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

We have many opportunities for parents to participate in school, and we depend on parents to keep our programs running smooth

our Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), E
nglish Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), and School Site Council (SSC). All groups work closely with 
administration. The SSC specifically helps to oversee the financial decision making of the school. Parents of English learner
s are vital to our English 
L
anguage Advisory Committee (ELAC) and to our outreach efforts on behalf of new families. Room parents organize parent volunte
ers to help with special 
projects in the classroom and chaperone field trips. We ask all parents to attend Back

We dismiss students at 
1:10 p.m. every Thursday to allow time for teachers to collaborate, both within and across grade levels. Nishimoto teachers h
ave 
a significant role in school decision

making. This is fostered by the Professional Learning Community model, which has a strong
 
staff training component 
based on school goals. Grade

level teams meet periodically with teachers from the grade level above and below for vertical articulation. At the bi

weekly 
meetings, we discuss student work samples and make adjustments to instructio
n as needed. Illuminate is data management software that collects and 
analyzes data to help us assess student progress.We train all teachers on the Illuminate system so that we can make effective
 
use of its capabilities. 
Grade

level team leaders meet month
ly. They communicate the business of these meetings to their team members. In addition, they act as mentors for 
the new teachers on their teams. The new teachers have been assigned on site mentors. The District provides mentors or coache
s for new teachers.
 
We 
plan to institute a powerful system of professional development with follow
