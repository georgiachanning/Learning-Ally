By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Year and month in 
which data were collected:
 
September 10, 2019
 
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum are aligned to the California Content Standards and Frameworks. Instructional 
materials are selected from the state's most recent list of standards
-
based materials and
 
adopted by the State Board of 
Education. The district follows the State Board of Education's six
-
year adoption cycle for core content materials 
(English/language arts, math, science, and social science).
 
 
On Tuesday, September 11, 2018  the Snowline Joint
 
Unified School District's Board of Education held a public hearing to 
certify the extent to which textbooks and instructional materials have been provided to students. The Board of Education 
adopted Resolution #19
-
1352 which certifies as required by Educa
tion Code §60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional 
materials were provided to all students, including English learners, in the district to the extent that each pupil has a 
textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to take home, a
nd (2) sufficient textbooks and instructional 
materials were provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards 
and consistent with the cycles and content of the curriculum frameworks in math, science, 
history
-
social science, and 
English/language arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materia
ls 
used for their visual/performing arts curricula. During the 2018
-
19 school y
ear, Snowline Joint Unified School District 
provided each student, including English learners, enrolled in a visual/performing arts class with a textbook or instructiona
l 
materials to use in class and to take home. These materials complied with the state's
 
content standards and curriculum 
frameworks.

Although the current history/social science 
materials are not 
from the most recent state 
adoption, our district has determined they 
are similarly aligned to the state standards. 
The teachers use supplemental units and 
materials to fill any gaps. Our math teams 
continue to meet collaboratively around 
essential standar
d instruction, learning, and 
assessment.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Ye
ar)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional through proper facilities 
maintenance and campus supervision. Ongoing maintenance and campus improvements ensure facilities remain up to 
date and provide adequate s
pace for students and staff. District maintenance and site custodial staff ensure that the 
repairs necessary to keep the school in good condition are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used by 
school and district staff to communicate non
-
routine maintenance requests. 
 
 
Every morning before school begins, the custodian and campus monitors inspect facilities for safety hazards or other 
conditions that need attention prior to students and staff entering school grounds. The custodians monitor the facilities 
throughout the da
y to ensure students and staff are safe during and after school. Two
-
day custodians and four evening 
custodians are assigned to Baldy Mesa Elementary School. The day custodians are responsible for: 
 

 
Cafeteria setup/cleanup
 

 
Office area cleaning
 

 
Restroom cle
aning
 

 
General cleaning of classrooms
 

 
Special event preparation
 
The day custodian checks restrooms throughout the day for cleanliness and subsequently cleans restrooms as needed. 
The evening custodians are responsible for thoroughly cleaning restrooms and c
lassrooms. The principal communicates 
with custodial staff daily concerning maintenance and school safety issues.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance 
 
 
Pinon Hills Elementary School participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides dollar
-
for
-
dollar matching funds to assist school districts with major repairs or replacement of existing school building components. 
Deferred maintenance projects generally include roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, 
interior/exterior 
painting, and floor systems. During the 2018
-
19 school year, Pinon Hills Elementary School received 
$44,804.57 in deferred maintenance funds for the repair and/or maintenance of asphalt, plumbing, HVAC, painting, 
carpet, fire alarm system, and district wid
e wall system.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula

scores.

Professional development over the past three years has included a sustained focus on the Common Core State Standards 
(CCSS) in both English language arts (ELA) and mathematics. Student 
achievement data clearly shows that both the former 
and the latter need significant attention in regards to instructional practices and intervention. Additionally, teachers are 
being provided textbook adoption training in the areas of math (TK
-
8) and histo
ry/social science (6
-
12) to ensure 
effectiveness and fidelity when it comes to using the new curricular materials. The Next Generation Science Standards 
(NGSS) Transition Team, composed of elementary and secondary teachers, continues to learn and build its
 
capacity in 
efforts to coach and support colleagues at their respective campuses. Tier I and upper tier Positive Behavior Interventions 
and Supports (PBIS) forums offer PBIS coaches and administrators training and collaboration opportunities intended to 
e
nhance PBIS systems across the district. The New Teacher Academy supports both teachers who are new to the 
profession as well as veteran teachers who are new to Snowline. This school year, all Snowline teachers will participate in 
the first of five Kagan C
ooperative Learning trainings, which are designed to show educators how to raise the level of 
student engagement and, in turn, increase student achievement. The importance of ensuring quality professional 
development for our instructional paraprofessionals
 
is also a priority. Training days on how to properly assess literacy and 
support students with special needs are facilitated.
 
 
The following are the number of professional development days (full school days) allocated to specific areas of need over 
the co
urse of three years (2017

A vast majority of professional development occurs in
-
district during the school day. Substitute coverage for participating
 
teachers is coordinated through the Student Learning and Support Services department. The 
training sessions are
 
generally facilitated by district and site administrators and teachers.
 
 
Professional Learning Communities (PLC), supported by site administrators and district personnel, are the primary vehicles 
utilized to evaluate student academic 
data and classroom teaching practices. Snowline has moved towards greater 
consistency in regards to assessments used across the district. All students in grades 3
-
8 and 11 participate in the Interim 
Assessment Blocks (IAB), which align with the California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) and 
is an accurate performance predictor for the same. Principals and other site administrators conduct classroom visitations 
and provide specific feedback to teachers that validates strong teaching p
ractices and/or brings attention to areas in need 
of growth. Teachers have a great deal of access when it comes to obtaining the specific professional development they 
need in order to maximize their effectiveness and increase the level of learning among t
heir students.
