School Description
 
Magnolia Elementary School, built in 1957, is located in the historic Olde Carlsbad 
neighborhood of 
Carlsbad, California.  Magnolia Elementary is a kindergarten through fifth grade school focused on 
providing rigorous instruction in a collaborative and supportive environment.  Magnolia prides itself on 
providing a well
-
rounded education f
or students through innovative curriculum, enrichment activities 
and sustainability efforts.  Students and staff strive to view themselves as part of a larger global 
community, in which they know their personal impact and make efforts to improve the world 
around 
them.
 
 
At Magnolia Elementary we believe that students learn best when content is relevant and focused on 
real
-
world problems and driving questions.  We seek to use an inquiry approach to build and construct 
knowledge collaboratively, and we constan

natural creativity to bring out the innovator in each child.  Above all else, we want students to be able 
to critically explore and question the world around them in a safe, challenging and inclusiv
e 
environment.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
The mission of Magnolia elementary is to inspire and support students to become confident learners 
who are critical and innovative thinkers, effective communicators, skilled collaborators and engaged 
community members.
 
 
Vision Statement
 
Magnolia provides a safe, student centered learning environment where students and teachers engage 
in relevant, authentic and interdisciplinary learning experiences.
 
 
Aaron Nelson, PRINCIPAL
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
The District believes 
in "Best First Instruction," which means each teacher is accountable for the learning 
needs of the students in their class.  Teachers differentiate based on student learning needs and they 
collaborate with grade level team teachers as well as the principal
 
to ensure students progress at every 
level.  Beyond the general education classroom, Magnolia Elementary provides Learning Center support 
for students, reading intervention, and Guide counseling.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the 
CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and 
comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dy
namic system 
that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, 
course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and o
ther locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on 
a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation,
 
the length of 
time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs 
available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California
 
is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agenci
es (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data report
ed in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardi
ans and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., Calif
ornia Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California Stat
e University, or career technical

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district 
makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All students benefit from the active participation of our parents and local community who support our 
instructional program in a variety of ways. 
Volunteers participate in the School Site Council (SSC), the PTA, and the room parent program. They also help with strategic 
planning, volunteering in the 
classroom and in the Everyone a Reader program.  Parents 
also participate in school wide events such as Back
-
to
-
School Night, Open House, Field Day 
and Science Day. The PTA sponsors events to enhance the school and instructional programs, including PE, music, and art instr
uction. For more 
information about volun
teering at our school, contact our principal.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Oth
er local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
We revise and update our school safety plan each year in the fall. Our current school safety plan meets all federal, state, a
nd district standards for a 
comprehensive school safety plan. It addr
esses prevention, planning, responding, and recovering from possible threats (earthquakes, intruders,  fires) to 
ensure the safety of students, staff, and visitors. Our counselors, psychologists, and site administrators are extensively tr
ained in threat as
sessment 
techniques by nationally recognized experts in school
-
threat assessment. To ensure safety on our campus, a school site safety committee conducts 
inspections to identify potential hazards. We have also developed a disaster preparedness plan, and we
 
conduct regular fire and earthquake drills to 
familiarize staff and students with emergency procedures. Our school site is also monitored for physical safety. Play structu

landscaping are maintained at a high standard for s
tudent safety and undergo regular inspections. A new visitor check
-
in system is being implemented, 
requiring all visitors to sign in and out.
