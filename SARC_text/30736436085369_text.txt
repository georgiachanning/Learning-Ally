By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our mission statement:
 
At Thorman, we empower GRIT
 
 
Gratitude
 
Resilience
 
Innovation
 
Thinking Critically
 
 
Again during the 2019
-
20 school year, Jeane Thorman Elementary School we focus on 
rigorous standards, engaging 
strategies supported by technology leading to increased student learning and a comprehensive learning experience.  
Students continue to learn the importance of being ALERT
-
 
attentive, likable, eager and reliable.
 
 
To help 
accomplish our mission, the administration, students, staff and parents are encouraged to instill five core values 
that best represent Jeane Thorman Elementary.  Those five core values are Attentive, Likable, Eager, Reliable, and 
Thoughtful (ALERT). We bel
ieve in the importance of developing resilience within our school community of using grit 
during tough times to work through the difficulties our students face on a daily basis. We are accountable to ourselves, as 
staff, students, parents and community mem
bers to prioritize, embrace challenges, set goals, practice, take risks, compete 
and finish strong in all we endeavor. We will work in unity toward common goals with consistency in learning and 
behavioral expectations, instructional strategies, and support
s to aid all students in meeting high levels of achievement. 
Our students will develop the courage and personal integrity to take academic risks, to achieve high levels of achievement 
by setting goals and stretching beyond their comfort levels.
 
 
We believe
 
a promising strategy for achieving the mission of Jeane Thorman Elementary School is to develop our capacity 
to function as a professional learning community. Teachers meet weekly to develop common assessments based on 
essential standards. Together they a
nalyze data and share strategies and plans for intervention when needed. In addition 
to teacher
-
created assessments, data from District formative and summative assessments are used to monitor progress 
and plan instruction. Students  At Thorman, all stakeho
lders have high expectations for all and we accept no excuses for 
below standard work. With the implementation and reinforcement of our core values, as well as the data that is collected 
to help drive our instruction, we are confident that all students wil
l work at the highest of levels.
 
 
This year the Spanish Dual Immersion Program joined us and aligns seamlessly to mission and vision of GRIT.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Tustin Unified School District takes great efforts to
 
ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in 
this effort, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School 
Construction (OPSC). The results of this survey are available at
 
the school office, the District office, or on the Internet at 
https://tinyurl.com/TUSD

Tool. The District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to 
keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timel
y manner. A work order process is used to 
ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
A complete modernization of Thorman was  completed in September of 2016. Included in the project are all new 
classrooms and new e
xterior doors, classroom furniture, interior casework, lighting, windows/solar tubes and a brand new 
library. Thorman Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers.  A scheduled 
maintenance program is administered
 
by the District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are adequately 
maintained. The school is in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and State 
earthquake standards.  Regular  monitoring of school grou
nds before, during and after school is performed by assigned 
staff.   The school's large, grass
-
covered sports fields serve as a hub of school and community athletic events after school 
and on weekends.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Ac
hievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alt
ernate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements 
for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents and our safe school environment Jean Thorman Elementary has 
multiple opportunities for parents to become involved. Our parent community is involved in advisory and decision making 
positions through participation in the School Site Council and Engl
ish Learner Advisory Committee. These members work 
together with the administration to monitor the annual plan and make adjustments throughout the academic year in 
order to meet or exceed our annual academic achievement goals. Family Nights are held to fam
iliarize parents with the 
curriculum and to strengthen the home
-
school connection. We are working with Western Youth Services to coordinate 
speakers to present on topics important to our parents at our Coffee with the Principal events. Parents can voluntee

our Panther Play program to facilitate organized games during lunch recess time. Teachers communicate student progress 
in all curricular areas and social development on a regular basis via teacher Haiku or Google webpages, parent/teacher 
conferences,
 
and our monthly newsletter in order to keep parents current on the latest activities at Thorman Elementary. 
To help parents see what goes on in classrooms and make them feel more comfortable, all teachers plan and host an 
activity that parents are invited
 
to participate in. Additionally, the parents and teachers have come together to establish 
a PTA where both teachers and parents collaborate to improve the educational opportunities and collaboration between 
teachers, parents, and students. Thorman hosts s
everal fun family evenings each year such as Family Game Night, 
Ceramics Night, and Family Fitness Night. All events are advertised and shared on social media as well through  Aeries

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
Thorman Elementary 
School receives funding for categorical programs focused on ELL and At
-
risk students that are 
available at our school site in addition to base funding to support all students.  These program funds include LCFF
-
EL and 
Schoolwide Title I Program funds.  The 
Tustin Public Schools Foundation and site PTO/PTA also supports the school with 
donations and financial support throughout the year to support school
-
wide programs and events for students.  The 

School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) identifies
 
student needs and addresses specifically how these 
categorical funds will support student learning and achievement through a Multi
-
Tiered System of Supports.  The 
categorical funds are used to provide tiered and targeted supports or interventions for at
-
r
isk students in the areas of 
academics, behavior and social
-
emotional learning, and absenteeism, professional development, instructional materials, 
additional personnel to support all students in accessing academic standards, and technology resources. All 
categorical 
expenditures are monitored and approved for appropriate alignment to the SPSA and program guidelines by multiple 
centralized support personnel within Tustin Unified School District. Rationales for expenditures must be provided, aligned, 
and app
roved prior to purchase and use. These safeguards of fiscal support allow us to provide the necessary and 
appropriate support for our under
-
performing students in all areas.
 
 
The majority of site categorical funding is used for student interventions, staff
 
development, and personnel costs.  Staff 
development is focused on targeting skill instruction and providing in
-
services on research
-
based best practices in the core 
instructional areas including the dual immersion program.  Personnel costs include instru
ctional aides who provide 
classroom support during reading instruction, a part
-
time School Counselor, and a Community Liaison.  Supplemental 
materials to address needs were also purchased to support reading, math, computers, software, as well as staff 
deve
lopment.
