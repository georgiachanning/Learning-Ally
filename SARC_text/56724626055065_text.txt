Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Hollywood Beach School is highly suited as a learning environment. The facility is safe and clean, and there is adequate 
space for the number of staff and studen
ts at the school.  The custodial staff and the groundskeeper work collectively to 
ensure the building and grounds are clean and free of litter and graffiti. Together, school and District personnel work to 
ensure that the facility is maintained in a manner 
that assures it is clean, safe and functional as determined pursuant to 
an interim evaluation instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. Signs are 
posted to inform residents that skateboards, bikes, and dogs are n
ot allowed on the campus.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff D
evelopment and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Administrators, teachers and paraprofessionals participate in professional development focused on the California 
Common Core State Standards in order to improve their skills in teaching and assessment of student 
learning. The primary 
focus areas are instruction of grade
-
level content standards, intervention strategies for students who have not mastered 
standards, and assessment of student progress. 
 
 
The primary area of focus for the most recent three
-
year period 
was:
 

 
English Language Arts
 

 
English Language Development
 

 
Writing
 

 
Mathematics
 

 
C.H.A.M.P.S. Program (Conversation, Help, Activity, Movement, Participation, Successful Students)
 
Professional development is offered during the teaching day, on three student
-
free
 
staff development days, during 
summer institutes, after school, and on weekends. Substitute teachers are provided and the negotiated hourly rate is 
offered for attendance.
 
 
During the school year, teachers are supported by classroom observations, staff 
meetings, and grade
-
level/content area 
collaboration. Professional learning agendas are based on student achievement data and teacher input. In 
reading/language arts and mathematics, student performance data is ongoing and evaluated using a common assessme
nt. 
A Student Progress Report aligned to the California Common Core State Standards is sent to parents at the end of each 
trimester.
