About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Textbooks and Instructional Materials
 
A representative group of teachers and administrators review
s instructional materials. The committee meets for a detailed comprehensive analysis of

1. Compliance wi
th Board Policy and Administrative Regulations 2. California standards alignment
 
3. Focus on coherence within a grade and across grade levels
 
4. Rigor and balance
 
5. Access for all students
 
6. Assessments for progress monitoring and in support of the 
California assessments 7. Support for English language learners
 
8. Support for special populations
 
In addition to the items delineated above, the committee considers digital resources for staff, students and parents to suppo
rt learning in varied 
environmen
ts. The committee reaches a consensus, and the Board of Education makes the final decision on the chosen textbooks upon revie
wing the 

 
Textbooks were chosen using state
-
approved lists, and the content fit within the curriculum fr

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Cloverly Elementary was established in 1950. There are 20 classrooms on the campus, one of which is considered portable and i
s utilized as a Makerspace 
for students and teachers to take part in science, technology, e
ngineering, and math (STEAM) activities. In addition to classrooms, Cloverly includes a 
media center/ library, a computer lab, a cafeteria and a large athletic field. The Cloverly campus is in good condition as re
ported on the 2019 FIT Report. 
There are su
fficient classroom, playground and staff spaces to support teaching and learning. Most modernization projects using bond proc
eeds have 
been completed and the final projects will wrap us in summer of 2020.
 
 
The Cloverly campus is maintained and school safet
y ensured by a district maintenance crew of 10 and by a site janitorial staff of three. Issues and repairs 
not resolved by the site janitorial crew are completed by the district maintenance crew on a prioritized work
-
order system. Modernization projects 
co
mpleted in 2016 using bond proceeds have enhanced all classrooms for all students. Improved lighting and technology provide s
tudents with computer 
science opportunities and 21st century learning skills. Cloverly maintains classrooms and grounds as pleasant
 
places to meet and learn.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Parental Involvement:
 
Cloverly is a school where we provide parents, family, and community members numerous opportunities to be informed, involved 
and empowered in 
the education process.
 
Every month the school provides a time for family, friends and caregivers to eat lunch on the lawn with their child. On a bim

out
-
standing role in serving as 
role models for our Pillars of Character Program. Our School Site Council, which consists of parents and staff members, devel
ops, monitors and assesses 
our school site plan yearly to ensure that financial accountability and 
program goals are in compliance with our vision. The Cloverly PTA provides 
invaluable volunteer and financial assistance for school programs and activities. The PTA sponsors a plethora of family event
s that promote camaraderie 
and school pride. Our most po
pular events are the Mother/Son Bowling Night, Father/Son Laser Tag Night, Mother/Daughter Tea and the 
Father/Daughter Dance. Cloverly also participates in the Temple City Kiwanis Students of the Month Recognition Program.Quarte
rly, the principal sends

.  The Student Success
