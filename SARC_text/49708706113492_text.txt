School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

-
2003.  POCS has a total of nine 
classrooms. Five of the Charter classrooms are modular classrooms that are 14 years old 
and were moved to this site when the Jack London school opened.  There are two four
-
year
-
old modular classrooms and 
a set of student bathrooms that opened during the 20
08
-
09 school year.  There are seven full classrooms clustered in their 
own area and two classrooms about 30 feet away. Piner
-
Olivet Charter School and Jack London Elementary share the gym, 
food services, office, playground, and field area. The facility is 
safe and clean with regularly scheduled cleaning and 
maintenance as well as quick response to general repair needs. The facility is adequate for the needs of the school.
 
 
The playground was relined and marked during Spring 2010. Solar arrays were installed
 
on the campus during the summer 
of 2011 to help offset energy costs. The parking lot was lined in the fall of 2012.
 
 
The school is inspected for safety and repairs each summer.  It was last inspected in July 2018.
 
 
The school is in the process of a 
facilities assessment and will be completed early 2020.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Piner
-
Olivet Charter School has a Comprehensive School Safety Plan in place in coordination with Jack London School that 
we review and update annually. The plan includes elements that address general procedures and emergency situations. 
It assures the safe
ty of students and staff in case of any routine or disaster emergency situation. It also includes a 
communication plan with the district office and other district schools. The school has an intercom which allows the office 
to contact individual classrooms 
or the entire school in case of an emergency.  In addition to providing for students physical 
safety, the staff uses BEST Practices, Class Meetings, and other community building activities that help the school develop 
a climate that encourages students to 
interact positively with peers and adults on campus. The plan is reviewed with staff 
bi
-
annually and was last updated in January 2020.
