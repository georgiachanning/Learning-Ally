School Description
 
 
Palomar School is one of 49 schools in the Chula Vista Elementary School District, including charters. 
The school serves Kindergarten through sixth grade and special education students in Pre
-
K (SDC) 
through 6th grade. Our relatively small student populati
on (388) gives our school a feeling of 
community.
 
 
Mission
 
 
Palomar School's mission is to provide:
 

 
A safe and supportive environment that encourages consideration for others, self
-
discipline, and responsibility.
 

 
An opportunity for each student to 
reach his or her own potential.
 

 
A broad, basic curriculum with a variety of instructional methodologies.
 

 
Parental and community involvement.
 
 
Palomar School's priorities were to:
 

 
Improve staff, parent and community communication
 

 
Implement early interventio
n strategies which support all aspects of student success
 

 
Strengthen the Language Arts program with emphasis in reading, comprehension, 
vocabulary, spelling, grammar and writing
 

 
Develop grade level expectations for mathematics, which reflect both computati
onal 
skills and conceptual mathematical thinking and understanding.
 
 
Extended Learning Opportunities
 
Palomar provides a variety of programs that differentiate curriculum for the needs of all students. 
The Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) program allows
 
high
-
achieving students to extend 
learning beyond the confines of the classroom. 
 
 
Palomar School provides support for At
-
Risk and English Language (EL) learners. 
 
 
Progress Indicators:
 
Palomar School uses a variety of assessments to monitor the progress of our students. The school's 
curriculum, instruction, and assessments are all standards
-
driven. Teacher
-
created, in
-
program, 
computer, and all other academic assessments are based on the
 
standards and used to modify 
instruction. Each year the staff analyzes content clusters and skills in reading/language arts and 
math to identify weakest areas and meets with colleagues to modify instruction, focusing on areas 
of need, improving these and 
other important skills for all students. Ongoing staff development is 
provided by district coaches in various content areas.
 
 
Student achievement assessment data is analyzed and used to guide instruction and determine the 
site's goals for this 
School Plan
 
for student achievement.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Research shows a high correlation between parent involvement and effective schools.  We encourage paren
ts to become actively involved in our school.  
We have Parent Information Nights (curriculum content, Gifted and Talented Education) to keep parents informed about assessme
nt, curriculum and 
instruction and we provide parents with ways in which they can be
come partners with us in the education of their children. Parents are also encouraged 
to become involved with the educational program by becoming members of the school's School Site Council, ELAC committees, and
 
District Advisory 
Committee meetings.  Month
ly "Coffee with the Principal" sessions are conducted and monthly topics are scheduled based upon data collected from 
parents who completed a Parent Needs Assessment.
 
 
At Palomar School, there are many opportunities for parents to become actively involved 
in student and school activities.  Students and parents are also 
invited to family nights and participate in separate activities such as informational parent meetings and our annual variety 
show.
 
 
Parents and community are encouraged to attend and particip
ate in school
-
wide recognitions, celebrations, and family support services.  These events 
include our school spirit week, monthly recognition assemblies, nutrition planning and education for families, and Olympic Sp
orts Days. Palomar School 
administration,
 
teachers, and staff continue to work with parents to ensure they have a place they feel welcome.  We have collaborated with t
he Chula 
Vista Elementary Council of PTAs to establish a fully functional Parent Teacher Association on our campus.
