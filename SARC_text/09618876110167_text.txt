Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

CURRICULUM IMPROVEMENT
 
Curriculum improvement is a key component to guaranteeing the best educational program for our students.  The El 
Dorado County Office of Education, every year, offers a variety of seminars, workshops
, and classes for teachers.  Our 
teachers are encouraged and sometimes required to attend these teacher trainings and the district pays for the costs.  In 
addition, we have a number of student early release days so that the teachers can work in grade level
 
teams to plan and 
improve units of study or can work on school
-
wide articulation of the academic programs at Sutter's Mill.
 
 
INSTRUCTION
 
Monitoring of progress of under
-
performing students is ongoing and assessed continually through teacher observation 
an
d a variety of informal and formal assessments. When intervention efforts do not result in satisfactory academic 
progress, teachers refer students to the Student Success Team.
 
 
English language proficiency in listening, speaking, reading, and writing is as
sessed annually.  Teachers monitor progress 
on an ongoing basis, and students not making progress are referred to the Student Success Team. Title I students receive 
a pre
-
 
and post
-
test to assess eligibility, progress, and to determine when they should be 
exited from the program. 
Students also demonstrate achievement through a variety of ongoing assessments that include basic reading inventories, 
writing samples, and mathematical computations. Students not achieving as a result of intervention programs may 
be 
referred to the Student Success Team for possible special education assessment.
 
 
Students with special instructional requirements benefit from an integrated teaching approach. Effective communication 
between regular class teachers, special services teac
hers and student support personnel provides for adequate assistance 
and equal access and participation.
 
 
Supporting instructional components include: one resource class, a bilingual assistance/tutorial program and a 
speech/language program. All students ar
e formally assessed in reading, writing, and arithmetic a minimum of three times 
a year to determine academic progress.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our goal is to provide a physically and 
emotionally safe environment for the entire school community, with emphasis on 
our children.  Our School Safety Plan is discussed with faculty, reviewed for improvements, updated with county and state 
emergency service providers and approved by the board, 
annually.  The school conducts monthly fire drills.  There  are 
earthquake drills. In addition, we practice lock down drills with one of them being an all
-
person
-
site
-
evacuation by bus 
drill.  Emergency bags, with current information and supplies, are loca
ted in every classroom and office on campus.  
Cameras are installed on the site in various locations and monitored during the day to increase campus security.  An 
emergency alert alarm has recently been installedl. The comprehensive safety plan is annually
 
reviewed by parents and 
staff and is approved by the board every year.
 
 
The district currently has staff members who have training in applied behavioral analysis. These staff members can be 
asked to observe students who are exhibiting negative or atypical
 
behavior. From their observations strategies can be 
created to enable the teachers and administration to help these students develop more positive conduct both inside and 
outside the classroom. These staff members can also meet with teacher assistants and
 
recess supervisors to help them 
create positive relations with the students. The district also increased staffing to allow Sutter's Mill School additional 
counseling services to provide both educationally related mental health services as well as serve st
udents and staff 
demonstrating a need.
 
 
Grounds, equipment, and safety systems are inspected regularly. The buildings and grounds are maintained to the highest 
standards and are free of litter, safety hazards, and graffiti.

The district calendar scheduled one staff work day, two full staff development days and seven early release days for school 
directed staff development.  Currently, the County Office of Education (EDCOE) is 
coordinating efforts to present 
professional development on Universal Design For Learning (UDL) including the training of district liaisons.    EDCOE is also
 
facilitating a series of workshops (EPIC) to examine student data to determine areas of focus for 
schools and the district.  
This year, Sutter's Mill is looking at intervention strategies and the connection to special education referrals.  In other 
words, are our intervention programs effective?  To that end, training and professional development are t
o be supported.  
Additionally, staff has attended trainings on Trauma Informed Instruction and is supported in attending further trainings 
surrounding the social emotional needs of students.  Staff is always supported and encouraged in efforts to improve 
c
urricular or instructional skillsets through professional development opportunities.
